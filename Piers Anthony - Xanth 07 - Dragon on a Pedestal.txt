chapter ivy league irene held her little girl snugly before her as they rode the centaur they were approaching castle zombie and she didnt want any problems about sliding off ivy only three years old had not encountered a zombie before and might react in an unfortunate manner suddenly irene experienced a terrible vision she screamed and almost fell off the centaur herself chem centaur spun her front section about trying to catch woman and child before they fell simultaneously chet jumped close reaching out to steady them what happened he asked his free hand reaching for the bow slung over his shoulder i didnt see anything you didnt did irene told the centaur recovering they had been friends for a long time a vision it appalled me king dor riding chet glanced obliquely at irene he ev idently did not know how serious this might be so he limited his comment to practicalities lets get on inside the castle then you can tell us about it he didnt say so but he might have been nervous about having his daughter riding with a person who screamed without apparent reason for he reached droon on a pedestal across and lifted ivy from irenes arms irene stifled a flash of anger and embarrassment but did not resist the transfer she could hardly explain her reaction herself they rode on in slightly awkward silence the two centaurs choosing the path irene glanced at her husband and child dor had been young and gangling when she had arranged to become engaged to him and still somewhat unprepossessing when she had finally managed to marry him five years ago even though he was a full magician she remembered their nuptials with a certain fondness they had been in the zombie graveyard at castle roogna most of those zombies were gone now having perished at the brutal hands of the invading mundanes it was difficult for a zombie to die since it wasnt really alive but it could be hacked to pieces however the newer zombies here at the zombie masters own castle in the uncharted wilderness of southern xanth had not been subjected to such indignity she closed off that subject in her mind as she was not partial to zombies useful and loyal though they might be she returned her thought to dor the assumption of the throne of xanth had abruptly matured him at least in her eyes and the arrival of their darling child two years later had matured him again now at age twentynine dor seemed quite solid and respectable in a few more years he might even look kingly ivy in contrast was a bundle of squiggle she was large and agile for her age with fair hair that bore just a tinge of green and eyes with more than that she was insatiably curious about the whole of xanth that was natural with any child of course irenes parents who had ruled xanth before dor had remarked on her own propensities for mischief at an early age irenes magic talent was for growing plants which was prob ably why her own hair was green and it seemed that talent had manifested early before she had learned to talk she had caused all manner of weeds to sprout around castle roogna blue roses were all right but skunk cabbages were awkward particularly when they got upset ivys talent though was of a different nature they had had to readjust palace life when she was around because halsh it was a zombie centaur guarding the approach to the castle of the zombie master zombies came in all varieties dragon on a pedestal most wereor had once beenhuman but some were animal or crossbreed the zombie master could reanimate any dead creature giving it perpetual halflife this ones hide was mot tled with mold and its face was rotting out but otherwise it was in fair condition we are here for the twins debut king dor said just as if he were addressing a living creature please let us pass ssurre the zombie said evidently it had been told to be accommodating for this very special occasion zombies had rotten brains but could comprehend and remember simple in structions they moved on toward the castle it was a truly grotesque specimen of its kind it had a moat filled in with thick greenish sludge populated by corrupt monsters its stones were degen erating slimestone it looked centuries old though it had been built less than a decade ago that was the way the zombies liked it they had made it and their ichor stained every surface the zombie masters twin children were alert both hurried out to meet the incoming party they were just sixteen lanky and fairhaired about the same height and almost identical from a distance but as they approached their distinctions mani fested hiatus was male with developing shoulders and the first traces of a beard lacuna was female her hair framing a rounder face and her clothing arranged to set off contours that were evidently not entirely to her satisfaction irene smiled to herself some girls filled out early as she herself had done while others were late lacuna would get there in due course welcome to castle zombie your majesties hiatus said formally the two were on their good behavior no mischievous magic occurred good to be here dor responded the truth was the king had come on business the twins debut was merely a pretext so that citizens of xanth would not be concerned that something was wrong for something was indeed wrong and this was to be a significant meeting it was perhaps the first genuine crisis since dor had assumed the throne on a regular basis and irene worried that he might mishandle it her father king trent had been fully competent to deal with anythingbut trent had retired and moved to the north village so as not to interfere dragon on a pedestal with the policies of his successor irene would have preferred to have her father closer by just in case she loved dor and always had especially when she was furious with him but knew he was not the man her father was of course she never displayed that sentiment in public her mother iris had long since impressed on her that it was not politic to be too open about the inadequacies of men particularly husbands espe cially those who also happened to be kings it was better to run things behind the scenes the oldfashioned way that was where the real power was we cleaned up the zombies for you lacuna said shyly irene glanced at the zombie centaur which had followed after them as a kind of honor guard gobbets of decayed flesh fell from its body as it moved and plopped sickeningly to the ground but the creature had a bright red ribbon in its tail we can see that she said diplomatically that was very nice of you zombies did take some getting used to but they were in their putrescent fashion decent folk it was hardly their fault that they had died and been reanimated as walking dead they crossed the moat using the warped wooden draw bridge irene couldnt help glancing down into the green fluid coated by slime and wrinkling her nose against the terrible smell no enemy in his right mind would storm this sewer a zombie water monster lifted its largely defunct head but did not bother them it was used to the frequent passages of the lively twins such a creature would not be very good for real defense because it had lost most of its teeth but naturally it would not be polite for a visitor to remark on that zombie monsters like husbands required careful management the interior of the castle was quite different for this was where millie the ghost held sway the stone floor was clean and pleasant draperies covered the walls the zombie centaur did not go inside and no other zombies were in evidence millie stepped forward to welcome them she was dressed in a soft pink gown that fitted her very well she had been in her teens for eight hundred years as a ghost in castle roogna but since then had had another twentynine years of real life just about tripling her mortal age she had been an amazingly supple creature as irene well remembered and irene had al dragon on a pedestal ways been secretly jealous of that but now millie was plump ing out in the manner of a pampered housewife she still had her magic talent though irene could tell by the way dor reacted she felt a stronger tinge of jealousy millie had been dors first love in a fashion for she had been his governess while his parents were away for extended periods but millie affected every man that wayand millies own love was only for her husband the zombie master so irenes jealousy was mainly a perfunctory thing and she controlled it rigorously she had come to know millie better in adult life and liked her personally millie was really very sweet and permanently innocent how she managed to be so after bearing and raising two children was a minor mystery and irene was also a bit jealous of that there was a small commotion outside and the twins dashed out to get in on the action in a moment they escorted amolde centaur to the interior amolde no zombie was much older than chet and chem and showed it he walked with a certain stiffness and wore spectacles and parts of his hide were turning gray he was a magician which magic had gotten him banished from his original home on centaur isle but his talent did not manifest in xanth itself he was also highly educated and intelligent and this did manifest he had briefly been king of xanth during the nextwave crisis and it was generally conceded that his special insights into the situation had been the critical factor in turning the course of the war to xanths favor irene liked amolde because of him she herself had been even more briefly king of xanth irene smiled to herself xanth custom prohibited any reign ing queen but did not specifically bar a female king that had been part of amoldes insight bless him after the polite greetings chet and chem went out with the twins to tour the grounds taking ivy along and the zombie master made his appearance he remained as cadaverous as ever but was neatly dressed in a black mundane suit and was actually fairly handsome in his fashion there was a pause dor turned to irene the vision he inquired gently the vision she had almost forgotten it now it came back dragon on a pedestal in its horror itit was a picture or a stilllife scene a statue two statues and danger the zombie masters head turned gravely dangerhere she suffered a vision as we approached the castle dor explained i thought it better to wait for privacy before ex amining it as sometimes these things are important indeed they can be amolde agreed there are aspects of the magic of xanth that remain obscure to us the predictive visions are a prime example i dont know that its predictive irene said it may be just my foolishness this is the best possible occasion to find out dor said if we cant figure it out good magician humfrey surely will when he arrives he reached across and took her hand you saw statues one was imbri the day marethe statue we made after she saved xanth from the horseman of course dor agreed reassuringly we all honor mare imbrium the otherseemed to be a dragon on a pedestal dor squeezed her hand he could be very comforting when he tried and that frightened you no not exactly not the statues they were just stone the zombie masters thin lips quirked perhaps the gorgon is involved i dont think so irene said but between them she paused having difficulty formulating what she had seen the void dor suggested helpfully mare imbri fell into it and it remains a danger not the void but something just as terrible i dont know what dor shrugged not understanding but now amolde stepped in applying his fine centaur intellect to the problem why would possible peril to two statues frighten you it wasnt to the statues irene said or from them they were just markers i think so there is a specific localeif we can but fathom it amolde said not here at castle zombie dragon on a pedestal not here irene agreed not anywhere i know of but definitely a place of danger is there peril to any of us here the centaur asked shifting to a new line of investigation i dont think so not directly to whom then im not sure irene said feeling her face clouding up i suspect you do know amolde persisted if not peril to us or to yourself perhaps to someone you love ivy dor exclaimed that was it between the statues she agreed heavily your little daughter between the statues amolde said was she hurt no just there she seemed almost happy but it terrified me i just knew something awfulthat ivy wouldi dont know it was all in together in that one scene night mare dragon and child amolde said together in danger perhaps that is sufficient warning to enable you to avoid that situation well keep her away from statues dor said reassuringly it all seemed foolish now the vision didnt necessarily mean anything and if it did it wasnt the statues that were responsible they were just there mare imbri would never bring harm to ivy not even a bad dream and the dragon that one resembled the gap dragon for it had six legs but seemed smaller such a dragon would be dangerous for any dragon was dangerousbut how could a dragon statue harm anyone and why would anyone make a statue of a dragon it made no sense irene relaxed now four magicians were present and they could settle down to the business of planning the party for the twins debut which business they promptly ignored millie had worked out the plans privately and in an hour would stage a splendid display buttressed by such props as talking objects and fantastic plants courtesy of the talents of dor and irene wasnt humfrey supposed to join us by this time dor inquired his tone showing mild annoyance dragon on a pedestal definitely the zombie master agreed i cant think whats keeping him hugo irene said succinctly hugo was the retarded son of the magician humfrey and the gorgon his name a com bination of theirs humfrey and gorgon well irene corrected her thought maybe retarded was too strong a term for hugo certainly the boy was slow and his magic virtually useless and humfrey kept him largely confined to the castlebut perhaps he would improve with age humfrey was after all well over a century old and so might have had difficulty fath ering a completely healthy child unkind as it might be to think of it that way or perhaps hugo was merely a slow developer who could tell what he might be when he was eighty or ninety years old things do tend to go wrong when hugo is along dor remarked the boy is a born bungler humfrey did mention that he planned to bring hugo so he could meet the other children here the gorgon will be in charge of humfreys castle for the day the other children irene asked lifting an eyebrow her brows were modestly green like her hair and she had culti vated just the right arch to make the expression effective vol umes could be conveyed by the small motion of an eyebrow if one had the talent the twins are sixteen and ivy is three hugo is eight with whom does he play we asked humfrey to bring the boy the zombie master said they very kindly shared their castle with us for a decade but when hugo arrived it was time for us to make room they bore with our children we can bear with theirs for a few hours millie said smiling from the doorway irene had forgotten she was present millie still had a certain ghostlike quietness at times we can proceed without him dor decided he was after all the king he could not afford to twiddle his thumbs in definitely humfrey will know all the details when he arrives he has already advanced some advice though we are not sure what it means which is typical of his advice irene murmured its about as clear as a vision is dragon on a pedestal good enough the zombie master agreed the situation is this a dragon a dragon irene exclaimed sitting bolt upright seems to have moved into this general region and is terrorizing the populace we have set out the usual wamers and my zombies are currently patrolling but this is a singularly omery creature that refuses to be bound by normal conventions therefore stronger measures are in order irene relaxed again this did not seem to be the dragon of her vision we do have strong spells in the castle roogna arsenal dor said but the good magician sent word not to bring any weapongrade enchantments thats what mystifies us why not use something effective against a rogue dragon i could conjecture amolde began they were interrupted by a terrible roar that stiffened irene again it resounded throughout the castle making the very stone shake millie the ghost jumped up oh i told the children not to tease the monster under the bed she exclaimed almost float ing out in her haste to attend to the matter teasing a monster irene inquired raising another fine green eyebrow that roar had really given her a start the zombie master grimaced apologetically there are monsters under every childs bed but ours is more sensitive than most the poor thing gets quite upset the children like to dangle their feet down barely within its range then yank them up just as its hairy mitt grabs for them or they squirt perfume at it that sort of thing it really isnt nice to do that we want them to treat magic creatures with the respect they deserve irene suppressed an illicit smirk she had always been afraid of the monster under the bed and in childhood had tended to leap into bed not from any joy of sleeping but to avoid the anklegrabbing mitt the monster had disappeared when she grew up and she came to doubt that it had ever existed but recently ivy had claimed to have seen it when irene had checked there had been nothing there so she knew ivy was imagining it probably the monster had died of old age the droon on a pedestal strangest thing was that though her monster had definitely been real when irene herself was small her own parents had pre tended not to see it why had adults refused to see her genuine monster while now her child pretended to see it when it wasnt there regardless she had no sympathy for the thing monsters under the bed were a species of creature like dragons and nickelpedes that she felt xanth would be happier without cant it reach to the top of the bed amolde asked in terested centaurs do not use beds so i am not conversant with this particular monster that is not the nature of bed monsters the zombie master explained they can not depart their lair it is too bright above you see their domain terminates where the shadow does they have to travel at night but only the gravest emergency will lure a bed monster from its lair even then they just dont feel secure in the open irene could appreciate why if she ever caught such a mon ster in the open she would take a broom to it you were about to conjecture about humfreys motive irene reminded amolde ah yes the centaur magician agreed the good ma gician always has excellent reason for his actions or inactions if there were some special quality about this particular dragon it would be unwise simply to slay it we might thereby do irreparable harm to xanth by eliminating a rogue dragon irene asked incredulously dragons are common in xanth but there are different types of dragons the centaur pointed out just as there are different types of humanoids ranging from the giants to the elves some dragons are intelligent not this one the zombie master said or if it is it doesnt care to show it it just blunders along rampaging ran domly strange the centaur said i suppose we shall just have to wait for the good magician to enlighten us is it usual for him to be so late to a meeting nothing is unusual for humfrey dor said with a smile he does things his own way and can neglect or forget routine details dragon on a pedestal such as meeting with other magicians of xanth to work out a program to deal with a crisis irene said wryly a crisis that has been exacerbated by his refusal to let us use effective measures i understand he had some errands to attend to on the way the zombie master said mildly some magic potions he can harvest in this vicinity he is always collecting magic artifacts well he ought to know where they are irene said he is the magician of information dor twiddled his fingers against his knee obviously im patient with the delay should we make our decision without him we cant wait too long or the children will there was a crash followed by horrendous mixed noise speak of the devils the zombie master said now theyre playing their music box thats music irene inquired both brows raised its some sort of mundane device called a jerk box he explained teenagers associate with it juke box amolde corrected him gently my friend ich abod the mundane arranged to import it and humfrey found a spell to make it operate here i am not certain they exercised good judgment in this instance if thats mundane music im glad i live in xanth irene muttered wasnt there another problem dor inquired of the zom bie master the dour man nodded yes people have been turning up at the castle with amnesia amnesia they have forgotten who they are and where theyre going the zombie master explained it is as if they have just been bombut they possess all their faculties we cant send them home because we dont know where they belong animals toothey just wander aimlessly that sounds like a forgetspell amolde said like the one on the gap chasm dor asked no the zombie master said that spell makes people forget that the gap exists once they depart from it it doesnt make them forget who they are themselves dragon on a pedestal it hardly makes them forget the gap itself these days irene put in we are all able to remember the gap now still this could be a spell amolde said it is unfortunate the affected people are unable to remember what happened to them did anyone follow their tracks back irene asked yes of course the zombie master said we have several excellent zombie hounds we traced the tracks some distance through the forestbut there seemed to be nothing of significance the tracks just wandered randomly we did trace a couple back to their origins one came from the south village and his wife recognized himbut he neither re membered her nor was able to say what had happened to him there was no evidence of misplay anywhere along his route it seemed he had gone out to fetch a pine needle for his wife to sew with and never returned we retraced his route several times narrowing down the region where his progress became aimless but there was nothing no one else was affected and there was no sign of the passage of any unusual animal or plant at least he was able to rejoin his family irene said the zombie master smiled briefly fortunately she is an attractive woman or he might not have chosen to exercise that option he waved a thin hand in a gesture of negation but a number of other cases remain unsolved and in any event we dont want this complaint to spread especially not while a dragon is rampaging good magician humfrey will have the answers king dor said he always does take care he doesnt charge us each a years service for it amolde said with a faint smile humfrey normally did not charge other magicians as a matter of propriety or caution but the good magician was often absentminded all the other magicians of the senior generation had retired but humfrey seemed eternal irene wondered what his secret was she also wondered if they had not become too dependent on him for answers how would they manage if the good magician were no longer around to give advice that was not a pleasant thought but it would be foolish not to prepare dragon on a pedestal millie reappeared i had to pack them off outside she said but we had better finish the meeting soon or theyll be in trouble again all we need is the good magician arnolde said we have defined the problems he must define the answers its not like him to be this late the zombie master said not when the matter is important he doesnt like to leave his castle but he keeps a pretty strict schedule once he does perhaps i should send a zombie out he could be traveling by magic carpet irene pointed out or by direct conjuration he wouldnt bother with a footpath a zombie in a ragged tuxedo appeared at the door yes jeeves the zombie master inquired it seemed there were a few indoor zornbies performing necessary chores carpish ashoy the creature announced spitting out a de cayed tooth in the effort of speech well open a window the zombie master said the zombie dropped a chunk of sodden flesh from some where on its anatomy within the tux and went to a window after some struggle since its muscles were mostly rotten it got the window open then it shuffled out just in time a flying carpet glided in supporting two fig ures the good magician had at last arrived the carpet landed on the floor with a bump humfrey and his son sat there the good magician was a small wrinkled gnome of a man with a bare pate and thicklensed glasses hugo was evidently following the pattern of his father though his skin was smooth his head fairhaired and his face innocent he was very small for his age and already somewhat gnarled by no stretch of euphemism could he be called handsome and he was all too likely to grow into a man no prettier than hum frey too bad irene thought that hugo had not taken after his mother for the gorgon was as tall stately and goodfeatured as a human being came of course few people ever gazed on the gorgons features and those who did were likely to pay a rather severe consequence there were still a number of statues of mundane invaders placed around castle roogna souvenirs of the gorgons part in that last great battle dragon on a pedestal there was over a century between the ages of humfrey and hugo but they were obviously two of a kind physically alas not mentally humfrey was a special kind of genius while the boy come and sit down the zombie master said rising to welcome the good magician we have been waiting for you i am sitting jonathan humfrey grumped as he spoke the wrinkles around and across his face seemed almost to ripple i had other business hugo can join the other children irene said diplomati cally she knew the adults would not talk freely while the boy was present though hugo was unlikely to comprehend any thing significant no we have another chore and im behind schedule humfrey said your problems are these the gap dragon is ravaging the country you must not hurt it for it is necessary to the welfare of the gap especially now that the spell is breaking up spell king dor asked the forgetspell of course humfrey said as if impatient with dullness he probably had a lot of practice with that traveling with his son it received a fatal jolt in the time of no magic twentynine years ago and now is fragmenting and mutating forgetwhorls are spinning off and causing mischief they can incite partial or complete amnesia spray each whorl with this liquid to neutralize it temporarily then move it out of xanth to the mundane regions where it has no effect he grimaced remembering something not much effect at any rate it does cause the mundanes to forget that magic works not that that is very much loss for them he handed the zombie master a small bottle of translucent fluid with a nozzle and pneumatic bulb on it take it up hugo the carpet lurched into the air toward the wall no out the window idiot the good magician snapped out of patience before he started straighten out and fly right wait dor cried how can we spray and move the carpet straightened out wobbled then sailed through the window the good magician was gone dragon on a pedestal a forgetwhorl we cant even see hear or feel dor finished frustrated the others exchanged glances so much for our business meeting irene said we got the business the amnesia the zombie master said so it is from the gaps forgetspell mutatedi never thought of that no won der we couldnt trace the source of the problem the whorls would be undetectable and leave no trace except the wipeout of memory that was my question dor said invisible silent no smellhow will we know one is near until it is too late that is indeed a problem amolde agreed it had not occurred to me that such a fragmentation would be so undis ciplined but i suppose that if the forgetspell now lacks its primary object undisciplined dor said that describes the gap dragon too the breakup of the spell must have enabled it to remember a way out of the gap and it doesnt have any limit to its marauding up here in regular xanth but to follow it to its secret exit the zombie master said that will be dangerous the gap dragon is one of the largest and most savage creatures we know and no person in its vi cinity is safe we shall have to plan a strategy of procedure dor said we must deal with both the dragon and the forgetwhorls somehow at least now we know the cause of our problems amolde said humfrey was not here long but he did cover the essence perhaps we should proceed to the twins party before they become more restive so that we are freed from that distraction then we can meet again and try to work out he was interrupted by commotion and screaming from out side something dramatic was going on i fear they are already restive the zombie master said wryly they hurried to the window the good magician had used it offered a fair view of the moat and the surrounding coun tryside irene saw a cloud of smoke approaching through the forest im not sure the children are doing that she said dragon on a pedestal no it wasnt smoke exactly it was steam or condensing water it was puffing from the gap dragon amolde centaur exclaimed it is raid ing here and were not supposed to hurt it dor said with disgust what does humfrey expect us to dotie a yellow ribbon on its tail and follow it home the children irene exclaimed appalled the children are outside she charged through the castle and out the front portal oblivious to all else her vision the dragon ivy ivy she cried lacuna was sitting by the edge of the moat forming words sentences and paragraphs on the slimy surface of the water that was her talent she could cause print to form on anything and could change it at will she was so engrossed in her com position that she was obviously unaware of the approaching menace ivys all right your majesty shes enhancing the zombies they like her the gap dragons here irene cried but even as she spoke the monster appeared a great cloud of steam enclosing it irene tried to run along the moat bank to get at ivy but the child was on the other side so was the gap dragon it was bearing down on them irene screamed ivy looked up and saw her the child was facing away from the dragon then one of the zombies saw the dragon for a long moment it paused a thought churning through its sloppy cranial matter while the dragon steamed rapidly closer the thought was lucky it made it through to the zombies actioncommand center the zombie picked up the child and lumbered along the moat out of the dragons path it was an act of remarkable relevance for this type of creature the dragon steamed right up to the moatand hunched its foresection across it a large moat monster attacked being too far gone to harbor either fear or common sense but its teeth were mostly caries and could not make an impression on the steelhard scales of the gap dragon the dragon shook off the dragon on a pedestal zombie and plowed into the outer wall of the castle snoot first such was its impact that the stone crumbled inward the dragon stalled at last head buried in the wall but it wasnt trapped it wrenched its head up and a larger section of the wall crumbled out slimestone simply had not been designed to stand up to treatment like this zombies rushed up to defend the castle bearing rusty swords and rank clubs they sliced and bashed ineffectively at the dragons side and back irritated by this nonsense the dragon brought its head about and issued a blast of steam that entirely obscured the zombies when the cloud cleared the zombies were in a sorry state portions of their decaying flesh had melted away leaving steamed bones and much of what remained was too cooked to function well zombies were generally immune to physical damage other than being cut to pieces but there were limits these ones staggered and fell into the moat annoying the other moat denizens but enriching it with their substance the dragon having breached the castle defenses seemed to lose interest it turned toward irene the gap dragon was lowslung with a triple pair of legs exactly as in her vision its metallic scales shone green in the shade and iridescent in the sunlight one ear perked up the other was merely a stub evidently the casualty of one of its many battles indeed there were scars all over its treetrunk thick torso its eyes were bright with the malevolent delight of the rampage now irene became aware of her own peril she had been standing more or less transfixed by the action oblivious to personal danger the gap dragon was one of the most for midable monsters ofxanth ordinarily it was no threat to people outside the gap chasm that hardly mattered now the dragon took a step toward her as if deciding whether she was worth going after it was time to act irene brought out a pincushion seed grow she directed it and tossed it in front of the dragon the plant sprouted immediately forming a button that swelled into a cushion that sprouted a score of sharp pins their points jutting sharply out drogon on a pedestal the dragon paused to sniff at it a pin stuck in its nose the monster shot out a jet of steam but the pins didnt melt the cushion continued to grow the pin in the nose tickled the dragon sneezed that sent pins and steam flying out from the cushion the steam floated up into the sky while the pins rained down into the moat sticking the moat monsters pins didnt bother zombies but there was an angry squeal from the denuded cushion the gap dragon of course had not been hurt it was armored against swords pins were beneath its notice it peered again at irene still trying to decide whether she was worth the trouble of gobbling she did not wait any undue time for its decision she reached for another seed the dragon decided to explore in the opposite direction it turned about and moved off ironically irene found herself angry wasnt she good enough to eat more zombies rushed up armed with pickled stink bombs evidently the zombie master was getting his defenses orga nized the zombies lofted these bombs at the gap dragon who snapped the first out of the air with easy contempt and crunched it into a foul mass now the gap dragon made a sound that resembled its in itials it was not particularly intellectual but there was nothing wrong with its perception of smell or taste it could distinguish a foul stench quite as readily as could the next creature it coughed out another cloud of steam but the odor clung to its teeth really irritated now the gap dragon lunged and snapped up a zombie but the rotten creature didnt taste much better than the stink bomb the gap dragon spat it out with another utterance of its initials at last with poor grace the dragon gave it up as a bad job and humped back across the moat and galumphed away into the jungle the raid was over you would have done better chomping me irene called after the dragon snidely dont taste like a stink bomb she breathed a sigh of relief nonethelessthen remembered ivy she was the object of the danger in the vision where had the zombie taken her dragon on a pedestal irene hurried across the drawbridge and around the outside of the moat following the route she had seen the zombie take she tuned out most of everything else intent on this one thing along the way she saw the devastation left by the gap dragon with broken trees and pieces of zombie but not the thing she most sought her darling daughter where was ivy in moments others joined her searching the entire area which zombie took her the zombie master asked i can question that one i dont know one zombie from another irene replied the ugly clutch of apprehension tightening about her rib cage that vision was becoming more real then i will question them all the zombie master decided he brought out a battered hom and blew a blast that sounded like the final wail of a dying buzzard immediately the zombies converged from the entire area shuffling up so hurriedly that they left pieces of themselves all over the premises it was amazing the number that appeared soon there was a dense and grotesque crowd of the things irene knew that each one was a person who had died and been reanimated a lot of people had died in the past few years and would one more die in the next day no she cried mentally she could not even think of that which one of you carried ivy the zombie master de manded of the motley throng there was no answer which one of you knows who carried ivy he asked next three fetid hands hoisted tell me who carried ivy the zombie master said pointing to one of them irene realized that it took a special technique to question zombies they reacted literally like inanimate things zzussch the indicated zombie replied losing part of its lip in the effort of speech zush where are you the zombie master called another zombie shuffled forward where did you take ivy the zombie shrugged dropping a piece of bone from its shoulder dragon on a pedestal i fear it does not remember amolde said perhaps a forgetwhorl but then ivy irene began horrified the horror of the visionhad it been forgetfulness that would explain its un defined nature may be lost in the junglewithout her memory the centaur concluded for her now everyone understood there was an appalled silence into what league of incapacity and peril had ivy been thrown chapter humfreys horror i have to go to the good magician for advice irene decided he must be home by now i can reach him in half an hour that will be faster and better than casting aim lessly about the wilderness the rest of you can do that her husband looked at her with a certain familiar resigna tion he knew she would do things her own way regardless of his preference so he didn t set himself up for embarrassment by opposing her openly it did not seem to occur to him that her way was best men were not very practical in some respects i will organize a search party here to range farther into the local jungle dor said ivy cant be far away he did not seem unduly concerned but that was just his way irene knew he would leave hardly any local stone unturned youll probably find her before i get back she said though she had a sick premonition that this would not be the case that vision had been no passing fancy it had hinted at a terrible ordeal and danger as yet unglimpsed she gave dor a quick distracted kiss then turned to the more important busi ness dragon on a pedestal she brought out one of the seeds she had planned to use to entertain the twins now she had a better use for it this was a birdofparadise plant seed grow she commanded as she flipped it into the air the seed obeyed with alacrity irene had always been able to make plants grow so that in minutes one of them would complete a life cycle that would normally have taken months or years when irene had been a child the elders of xanth had judged her magic talent to be excellent but beneath ma gician level to her frustration her mother iris had been pri vately furious suspecting sexual discrimination but the fact was that her talent was not as versatile as those of her parents during the crisis of the nextwave invasion of mundanes five years ago when kings of xanth had been falling like mundane dominoes amolde centaur had assumed the throne and de creed irenes talent to be magician level her mother had not been partial to centaurs before then her attitude had suffered a remarkable change since that time as if in response to that promotion irenes talent had intensified so that now she could grow in seconds what had required minutes before she had become indeed a full magician perhaps it was the result of the birth of her unusually talented child ivy caused the qualities of those near her to intensify and this applied to both physical and magical aspects irene had always been nearest her child and yes the enhancement of her talent had manifested during her pregnancy funny she should realize this just now when her daughter was lost her comprehensive chain of thought was compressed into a very brief span because the seed was sprouting in the air at the same time sending out tendrils that radiated large smooth flat oval leaves that became wings that flapped and supported the swelling mass of the body before it fell to the ground another shoot became the ornate tail of the bird and another the head which was actually a phenomenal flower with lovely petals spreading delicately more she said and the plant renewed its effort and in creased its growth becoming much larger than it would ever naturally have been in moments it had a wingleaf span of twice irenes height and a massive if convoluted twistedstem droon on a pedestal body brown roots became legs and feet and claws the down draft of its beating wings flattened the grass beneath and stirred up a cloud of dust the birdofparadise plant was ready to fly the zombies were watching with dull interest never before having seen this type of magic perhapsthey wondered why only one seed grew instead of all the plants in range of the sound of her voice the answer was that it was more than her voice that did it it was her concentration she could have made any of the surrounding plants put on sudden new growth had she wished to but she had addressed only the one seed how ever there was no point in trying to explain such matters to zombies they could hardly understand ordinary things let alone magic ill be back in an hour dear irene promised dor as she mounted the bird she always took care to remind him in little ways how much she cared for him because she knew men were in constant need of such reassurance if they didnt receive it their attention could wander and that was not necessarily wholesome for a marriage there were many footholds and handholds amidst the vines of the plant so she had no concern about falling she settled herself in the saddle area and blew dor a kiss king dor nodded her magic with plants was old stuff to him his own magic was more than equivalent and he was as concerned as she by the peril to their child he would turn new leaves and old ones in the search for ivy rough as that might be on the trees of this region she nudged the birdplant with her knee and it took off for a moment it faltered for this was its first experience carrying a load then its beat strengthened and it forged aloft it circled gaining altitude while the zombies watched with another surge of dull curiosity irene tucked her green skirt in close about her knees aware that the view from below differed from that above in her younger days she would have reacted more strin gently as she had been very sensitive about people trying to see under her skirt in their chronic effort to discover what color her panties were now she knew that they didnt really care about that sort of thing and certainly zombies didnt but old reflexes died hard dragon on a pedestal the birdplant rose above the highest decaying spire of castle zombie above the tattered and slimy zombie flag and above most of the trees of the region from this vantage the zombies below looked like squashed slugs it was an improve ment the good magicians castle was northeast of here by foot the journey would have been next to impossible for most of the jungle here remained unexplored no telling what horrors lurked in uncharted wilderness but by air it was easy enough tooops clouds were headed this way mean little gray ones with tentacletendrils of dark vapor they were obviously up to no good the inanimate could be perverse in the wilder regions of xanth and clouds often liked to soak down passersby just for the electric thrill of it thunderclouds could get a real charge from such mischief they huffed and puffed their delight and crackled their merriment irene decided to get above these nuisances she nudged the birdplant and made it another upward loop but these annoying clouds were not so readily avoided they reared up new layers and projected longer contrails trying to enclose her in fog they blew out gusts of wind and the chill drafts made her shiver water coalesced on the slick wingleaf surfaces and caused the bird to gain weight and lose tractions oh fudge she thought angrily irene had little patience with this she had never put up with much guff from the inanimate having been exposed to the smart remarks of rocks and furniture and even water when dor was present his talent was making inanimate things talk that was fine it was an excellent talent and because of it he was now king and she was queenbut why did those things have to have such mouthy attitudes she brought out six more seeds from the bag she always carried with her grow she ordered them and flung them out the seeds sprouted sending out roots and vines in midair they flowered and fruited forming swelling gourdlike masses they were watermelons and required immense amounts of water to complete their cycles they normally drew this water dragon on a pedestal from the airand the air was filled with clouds which were of course composed of water droplets this was sheer delight to the melons because they were growing magically rapidly they drew their water fast the first cloud touched by a sprout ing seed was sucked dry in an instant it shrank and shriveled and disappeared with a breezy sigh the others suffered sim ilarly one larger cloud with a silvery crown above made a fight of it this was evidently the leader of the pack the king cloud reached out and enclosed the watermelon plant in vapor so that it disappeared but the watermelon only took in more water greedily its tendrils threading through the cloud and soon the embrace was reversed the cloud disappeared and a monstrous melon formed and plummeted to the distant ground one fragment of cloud tore free at the last moment and scudded away its contrail between its legs ill get even it seemed to mouth before it floated over the horizon you hav ent seen the last of me solid creature irene smiled it would be a long time before that survivor harassed travelers again dry up king cloud she called mockingly as it disappeared behind a hill she had gotten into the habit of talking back to the inanimate because of the way it talked back to her when she was with dor rocks and other things on the ground could be especially obnoxious when she stepped over them there was a splat from below and a bellow the melon had struck a firedog basking below and very nearly put out the poor creatures fire the scattered remaining clouds had learned their lesson they no longer intruded on irenes flying space that was just as well her long association with dor had taught her how to deal with the inanimate but she was now out of watermelon seeds and wasnt sure what she would have done for a follow up after all this had been a business and pleasure excursion when they had set off for the zombie masters castle she had left most of her weaponsgrade seeds behind she flew directly to the good magicians castle without further interruption trees and lakes and hills passed by below it was pretty enough scenery but she knew there were a number dragon on a pedestal ofunpretty monsters lurking in it that made her nervous again for the welfare of her daughter the jungles of unexplored xanth were no place for a threeyearold child her steed descended becoming uncertain irenes brow fur rowed what was the problem the turret of humfreys castle showed clearly in the vale she nudged the plant onward going for a landing on a convenient parapet the castle looked different from its configuration of the pastbut that was normal italways changed how humfrey managed this she had never discovered it was just part of his magic as the magician of information he obviously had in formation on how to revise castles periodically the talent of a magician was always impressive once the full extent of it was known too bad there were so few of that caliber her daughters talent had not yet been classified by the elders but irene had the depressing feeling that it was not magician level ivys presence tended to enhance the qualities of others that was nice for the others but what did it do for ivy herself now if ivy could enhance her own abilities what a creature she might become but that was a foolish daydream daydream hello imbri irene said and fancied she saw the flick of the day mares tail as a return greeting irene had come to know mare imbrium as a night mare but now imbri had become the bearer of the dreams of the day which were much more pleasant the mare was invisible most people never knew when she was present it didnt occur to them that dreams of any kind had to be formulated somewhere and be brought by someone dream duty was an often thankless task thank you for the dream imbri irene called belatedly but the mare had already gone a creature had to be constantly on the move to keep up with the delivery schedule for day dreams since so many people had them a human carrier would have been unable to keep the pace but horses were designed for running they glided to the turret the birdplant still trying to balk annoyed irene kneed it harder plants were not usually very smart so often they were not able to obey well but this was a simple landing procedure there was no excuse for holding back draon on a pedestal the leg and footroots touchedand made no contact the birdplant continued on down into the stone what irene asked startled to see her own legs disappearing into the castle rampart then they were all the way in it the good magicianss castle was nothing but fog she nudged the bird and it ascended rapidly drawing out of the darkness glad to get away from this now she knew why the steed had balked it had realized something was wrong irene looked down there was the castle exactly as before illusion she exclaimed the castle doesnt exist then she had a second thought it has to exist i need humfreys advice in case dor fouls up the search she nudged the bird down again cautiously again the two of them intersected the castleand found nothing of substance the good magicians castle simply wasnt there irene shook her head some joker is playing games and im sure it isnt my mother her mother queen emeritus iris was mistress of illusion but she seldom used her talent now and never for mischief it was a ssid fact that age was softening the senior magicians of xanth all except humfrey the oldest of all irene wondered again what the good magicians secret was he had been old before irene herself was bom and he remained oldbut no older than before in appearance maybe he had achieved the ultimate age the plateau beyond which the years became meaningless but she couldnt ponder that at the moment she needed to find him and quickly so as to learn how to save her child dor might or might not find and rescue ivy though he would certainly try humfreys advice would make that rescue certain if the castle isnt here it must be elsewhere she decided i know im in the right general region for she had flown here before and was familiar with the lay of the land she nudged the bird and it flew on northeast now an unrelated thought struck her she should have asked mare imbri about the vision after all imbris statue had been in the vision maybebut no imbri no longer brought bad dreams so she should not have done this still the next time the mare showed up irene would inquire imbri might know dragon on a pedestal or be able to find out who had brought the vision and why and what it signified soon another castle hove in view they glided down touchedand passed through another illusion irene ex claimed in disgust she slapped at the fog that formed it with out effect wishing she had another watermelon seed to dry it up then she nudged her mount to zoom onward very soon she came to a third castle again she approached cautiously and again it was illusion irene uttered an unladylike word the birdofparadise plant startled by the expletive shed several tendril feathers it derived from a line of creatures which associated with a far loftier realm than that described by such a word and so the shock was formidable irene was getting downright annoyed but sealed her erring lips the bird was getting tired no sense hurting it this way she had to find the correct castle soon before the bird wilted for she had no other flying seed with her oh the hazards of uripreparedness had she but known what was to happen maybe that dreadful vision had arrived late had it come to her before she left castle roogna she would have packed some devastating seeds a foulup in scheduling for visions but such bemoanment was useless and irene was a practical woman she directed the bird back the way they had come a new suspicion teasing her mind sure enough there was no castle visible where the last one had been it had faded out after she had left it the illusion was moving from site to site or from sight to sightso as always to appear before her leading her in the wrong direction she had caught it by surprise by backtracking suddenly but all that accomplished was the proof of its nature she had to get rid of it before she could spot the real castle but how could a person abolish an illusion that was like removing something that wasnt there irene concentrated her thought obviously she couldnt erad icate the nonexistent there had to be another way to deal with this it was no use to get rid of the illusions after she saw them she needed to stop new ones from forming so that she could find the real castle dragon on a pedestal she snapped her fingers suppose she stopped the illusion literally by fixing it in place so it could no longer move ahead of her she brought out a new seed then guided the tiring bird plant back to the location of the third phantom castle it was still there because she had not yet passed all the way out of sight of it evidently the illusion remained in place as long as someone was watching it it would have very little effect if that were not the case imagine an illusion that disappeared while being watched it would very rapidly lose its credibility grow she directed the seed and flipped it out the seed landed and bounced and sprouted into a black eyed pea the black eyes focused on the castle for such plants were always watching things the illusion castle would be intently watched for weeks until the pea grew old and withered and its vision failed she flew on if this worked the illusion would be pinned in place because it was still being watched it would not be able to move to new locations to bother her in moments she experienced the dismay of defeat there was the castle in front of her again she had another black eyedpea seed but what was the use of planting it if her ploy wasnt working meanwhile the birdofparadise plant was failing rapidly unable to remain aloft much longer it was really designed to be pretty rather than strong it dropped toward the phantom ramparts crash they collided with a wall the bird spun down shedding more featherleaves irene barely righted herself in time to land on her feet this illusion had teeth now she was without her steed and could not look for the she clonked her head with the heel of her hand as if to knock out the dottle this was no illusion this was the real castle the pea ploy had worked she didnt have to search for humfrey any more she tucked herself together and walked around the bank inside the moat toward the front gate soon she would be able to rescue ivy as she walked she fished in her bag for another seed she dragon on a pedestal had located the castle no thanks to the illusion but she would surely need there was a loud booming squawk an enormous shape lifted from an alcove in the castle wall spreading wings that seemed to block half the light of the sun it was a truly mon strous bird irenes fingers questing in the bag closed convulsively on a seed she was so surprised that she made no other motion she just stood there seed pinched between thumb and finger watching that gargantuan bird the bird swooped down extended a foot and grasped her in its claws lifting her from the ground she wasnt hurt for the claws were like heavy metal bars that confined her in a cagelike embrace rather than squeezing her she found herself aloft again and not by her own choosing finally she acted she threw the seed down grow she cried but she didnt even know which seed it was this was a roc the largest of all birds what was it doing with her rocs normally did not prey on human beings they required larger morsels to sustain them like dragons or mun dane elephants the roc having attained an awesome elevation in seconds now plummeted it swooped low banked and hovered for a moment releasing irene just above the ground then it hurled itself upward again with a downdraft of air that shoved irene back several steps and ruined her hairdo birdbrain she shouted after it disgruntled may a giant feather stick in your craw of all times to be subjected to such pointless mischief just when she was going in to see humfrey she paused annoyed by a new realization this wasnt coincidence this was the castle defense system all new comers had to struggle through three types of obstruction in order to get inside and see the good magician that was be cause humfrey didnt like to be bothered by trivial concerns anyone who really wanted to see him would persevere until he got inside at least that was the theory humfrey was a taciturn gnome of a man with his own omery ways of doing things no one really understood him except perhaps the gor gon his wife dragon on a pedestal but irene was the queen of xanth she wasnt supposed to be subjected to this indignity the traveling illusion the roc those were intended for lesser folk she paused lesser folk beware the arrogance of royalty she was just the woman who had married the king and her present concern was a personal one she could not presume to deserve favors that the least of the denizens of xanth could not she would dam well conquer these challenges herself she had already handled one the illusion now she would deal with the second obviously the roc was assigned to pick up all intruders and dump them well away from the castle she had to nullify that big bird but how the roc was far too powerful for any plant short of a tangle tree to conquer and she didnt want to hurt it it had not hurt her after all this was really a kind of game a challenge not warfare she checked through her collection of seeds purple tur nipsno good soda poppiesno night liliesno suddenly she brightened she had a rock garden kit with her that just might do it she heard a putrid sound in the distance her nose wrinkled that was the belch of a stink horn that mustbe the seed she had dropped back at the castle she could use that foul signal to locate the castle immediately she marched back toward the castle it took her a while for the huge bird had covered a lot of distance during the brief flight when she came to the moat she dropped her seeds on the ground grow the rock group sprouted rock moss spread across the ground forming a carpet colored stones expanded in pretty crystalline patterns sand formed in miniature dunes and tiny streamlets of water appeared from the whole issued the sound of strange music reminiscent of the noise of the twins jerk box but harsher irene didnt understand rock music but of course this was not for her benefit now she grew a water lily in the moat it formed a series of sturdy wide leaves steppingplaces across the water she started crossing dragon on a pedestal immediately the roc appeared again this time she was ready for it look over there bird she told it a roc garden the bird looked listenedand almost plummeted into the moat rawk it squeaked thats right birdrock irene agreed pattern and mu sicail yours the roc landed by the garden and stared at it fascinated it cocked its head listening rocs loved rock gardens irene knew she would have no more trouble with the big bird she proceeded on across the moat she knew there would be one more hurdle the stone walls of the castle were imposing they were fresh and firm unlike those of the zombie castle and were buttressed by a wooden lattice though they hardly needed it no normal person could scale this barrier of course she wouldnt have to she would have a climbing vine to do it for her if the front door was locked now she arrived at that door it was solid wood she knocked politely there was no response she knocked impolitely with no better result she looked for a knob or latch but there was none she pushed on the door but it was firmly in place she couldnt even find a lock it was probably barred on the other side she had expected as much this was unusual wood she had a general familiarity with many types of trees but did not recognize this particular kind it seemed almost as solid and hard as stone but it wasnt rock maple or ironwood very well she would use her talent she brought out a clingingvine seed and set it at the base of the wall grow nothing happened she stooped to check the seed but could not find it that was funny that hadnt happened in years it must have been a bad seed she took out a climbing bean and held it in her hand grow the bean shriveled up and disappeared irene stared at her empty hand this was definitely peculiar her climbing bean had changed to a hasbean experimentally she set out a firecracker plant seed this was another of the ones intended for the twins party too bad that party hadbeen so brutally broken up this plant wouldnt dragon on a pedestal help her cross over the wall but it would verify that her talent was in order grow the seed shrank until it disappeared there wasnt even the faintest of detonations it had done the opposite of what it was supposed to do then she caught on reverse wood she exclaimed when i exert my magic it acts backward her fatherinlaw bink had once spoken of wood like this found in the hinterland of xanth evidently the good magician had harvested some of it what a devious ploy now she had a problem if her talent worked backward near this wood how could she grow anything to help her she considered the castle wall and door again irene was a healthy woman but this sheer barrier was beyond her she could neither scale it nor break it down without help she might carry stones and pieces of fallen wood to lay against the wall and build a ramp she could use to surmount it but that would take many hourswhile ivy might be gobbled by a jungle monster any minute she needed to get inside the castle now humfrey had set up this challenge and she intended to conquer it but she was doing a slow bum at this delay bum could she set fire to the wood and destroy it no because her flamevine would only put itself out instead of burning she didnt know how to start a fire without magic dam it she swore stamping her foot in a fury of frus tration ive just got to get rid of that blankety reverse wood she put her hands on the nearest section of the lattice trying to rip it free but it adhered tightly to the wall now she knew why the lattice was thereto prevent her from using her magic on the wall all the wood the whole door included was made of this stuff maybe she could move away from the castle grow some thing useful and use it to surmount the wall the reversal did not apply to magic already completed it seemed for the bird ofparadise plant had not suffered until it cracked into the wall and that was a straight physical shock rather than a magical one but this process too would take time she might not be able to afford there was natural grass growing between the wall and the dragon on a pedestal moat maybe that was immune to the reversal grow she told it the grass shriveled back into the ground leaving a bare spot so much for that her talent workedbut not the right way shrinkage was no good for her but what about the stink horn she had made that grow nonow she saw it on the far bank of the moat it had grown some distance from the wall no exception there too bad her talent could not also shrink plants because then she could try that and when the wood reversed the thrust of her magic a pearshaped flash of light illuminated the inside of her head shrink plants the reverse wood was from a plant wasnt it if the stuff retained any life of its own which it might since it retained its magical effect grow she commanded the reverse wood immediately the wood shrank reversing her magic the lattice diminished to thin lines and the massive door warped and pulled away from its moorings becoming smaller the wood had reversed its own growth irene pushed the dwindling remnant aside and entered the castle serves you right wood she said ungraciously you shouldnt have messed with a person with magiciancaliber magic her husband had more than once accused her of always insisting on having the last word it was a true charge and she gloried in it no word was better than the last word she walked down the main entry hall a heavily veiled woman hurried up it was the gorgon whose direct gaze could petrify a person oh irene im so glad you made it you wanted me to come in irene demanded you knew it was me then why didnt you turn off the castle defenses i may have ruined them all i couldnt only humfrey can do that irene was in no mood for games not even with so formidable a figure as the gorgon why didnt he then the last thing i wanted to do was waste time oh its terrible i dont know what to do i wish i could change it but i cant change what irene snapped dragon on a pedestal oh you dont know of course the gorgon said distract edly you couldnt know know what this was not only annoying it was getting peculiar for the gorgon was normally the most sensible and selfpossessed of women here ill have to show you come to the playroom the playroom look gorgon my child is so is mine the gorgon was already leading the way frustrated irene followed the playroom was nicely set up with padded floor and walls and brightly colored toys a diapered baby sat in the middle chewing on a dragon doll he seemed to be about a year old i didnt know you had another child irene said surprised dont the gorgon responded grimly but thats obviously humfreys offspring there is the same she hesitated the same gnomelike features the gorgon asked well you have no need to be embarrassed i loved humfrey from the first for what he was his physical appearance was never important to me but his mind his talentthere has never been another like him in xanth yes of course irene agreed discomfited no reason not to have another that is not my baby not irene felt a slow flush creeping rebelliously along her neck had humfrey sired a baby by another woman and turned it over to his wife to raise no wonder the gorgon was beside herself i just cant believe she found she couldnt even utter the suspicion humfreys too brilliant and honest tothats why i came to see him you have seen him i have to get his advice irene flared why are you showing me his baby then she bit her tongue she hadnt meant to say that yet the gorgon hardly reacted thats not humfreys baby i assure you he would never step out on me not if he wanted to remain flesh instead of stone was that j k irint hpi what had happened no it couldnt be dragon on a pedestal irenes brow furrowed this was too much for her what are you saying thats humfrey irene laughed then she stopped perceiving the serious expression under the gorgons thick veil i must be misun derstanding all this in several crazy ways let the mirror show you the gorgon fetched a magic mirror and propped it up against a wall replay the scene she directed it a picture formed in the mirror it became as it were a window to a jungle scene there was a deep spring in a hollow the water not flowing out but rather keeping to itself by the springs edge there was only sand vegetation appeared in a peculiar concentric progression outward from it becoming lar ger the farther away it was until at a fair distance the trees were full grown it occurred to irene that someone or something must have taken a lot of trouble to trim this region clearing the spring but now the vegetation was growing back odd that it was not growing fastest nearest the water however a man tramped into view old and gnarled and small hum frey irene exclaimed when is he coming back to the castle i must talk to him in a hurry all manner of nasty private suspicions were allayed by the sight of him as hale and healthy as a gnome his age could be but she was aware that this picture did not jibe with what the gorgon had just told her what was the explanation just watch the gorgon said tersely humfrey approached the spring with exaggerated caution he extended a bottle fixed on the end of a pole carefully dipping from the spring when it was full he shook it so that the fliptop lid on it snapped closed poison irene exclaimed the opposite of healing elix ir not so the gorgon said his sample complete the good magician shook it dry then brought the bottle in to himself and wrapped it in a voluminous cloth he retreated from the spring and the view of the mirror followed him now he came to the magic carpet there sat his son hugo dragon on a pedestal looking as dull as usual a pile of soggy fruit before him it was really a pity irene thought about the boys inferior talent a really excellent talent could have redeemed most of his other inadequacies hugo tried but simply couldnt conjure decent fruit as it was hugo had to be a severe disappointment to his illustrious parents small ugly stupid and without useful magicwhat was there to say humfrey took time to put away his pole he handed the wrapped bottle to hugo with a warningthe picture conveyed no sound but none was neededin order to free his hands for the job his bag of spells was resting on the carpet beside the boy humfrey toted spells around the way irene toted seeds the pole evidently supposed to telescope into a smaller form balked with a grimace of irritation humfrey braced its base against the ground took a twohanded grip and shoved down reluctantly the pole contracted irene knew that if her husband dor had been doing that the pole would have com plained loudly about getting shafted the inanimate was always as perverse as it thought it could get away with humfrey took a new grip forcing the shaft to shorten again he was getting there the job took him some time for he was small and old while the pole exhibited a splendid diversity of resistances it tried to bow and twist out of the mans grip and it made itself slippery and it tried to spring back to full extension while humfrey was taking a new grip but finally he got it com pressed into a cylinder and then to a disk resembling a mun dane coin and put the disk in his pocket there was a shaking of the ground hugo covered his ears reacting to some horrible sound good magician humfrey whirled about to face the sudden threat the view in the mirror swung to bring into sight the gap dragon irene exclaimed in horror her memory of that monster was fresh from her own recent encounter thats where it went after it left castle zombie while i was looking for ivy the dragon bore down on humfrey and hugo steam jetting from its nostrils words were shouted still silent in the mirror and the magic carpet abruptly took off hugo sitting unbraced dragon on a pedestal lost his balance and fell off the carpet sailed into the sky carrying humfreys bag of spells away in a moment it was out of sight oh no irene exclaimed hes lost his magic the gorgon nodded grimly i should have been there she said touching her veil meaningfully men are so inadequate by themselves but someone had to tend the castle while he went for the water from the fountain of youth irene suffered another shock the fountain of oh i shouldnt have let that slip the gorgon fussed its a secret in the mirror the action continued the gap dragon bore down on the man and boy a secret irene asked distracted by the significance of the fountain despite the horror of the scene actually it wasnt a fountain just a pool or spring perhaps it only fountained at certain hours of the day or when the water level dropped and needed replenishing many people over the centuries had looked for the fountain maybe its pooliike aspect had caused them to miss it anyone who hap pened on it unaware and drank deeply not knowing its prop erty would have been put out of business by an overdose of youth dont you realize what that water could do for the people of xanth my father the good magician was yelling at his son hugo fumbled stupidly with the wrapped bottle he held the sequence seemed to take forever dragon advancing blowing steam man re treating boy extricating bottle dont you see it has to be secret the gorgon was ex plaining humfrey uses it judiciously to keep himself not much over a century old and the zombie master uses it to improve the performance of his zombieshe knew about it in the old days in his prior life and told humfrey it used to be a literal fountain but it wore down over the centuriesbut if it were available generally in xanth no one would ever die of old age and some things have tosoon things would be so crowded irene tuned her out watching the mirror finally the boy got the bottle out and the lid off responding to instructions dragon on a pedestal he swung the bottle in an arc so that its magic water flung out toward the dragon in a spreading stream watch out irene cried uselessly realizing what such an undisciplined splash could do the water struck the charging dragon who immediately began to shrink into youth it also doused the man irene watched dumbfounded the water of youth was a weapon for an overdose would rob a creature of all its adult powers it seemed that it did not have to be imbibed the mere touch of it on a persons skin sufficed but a weapon could be turned against friend as well as foe both dragon and magician were helplessly youthening the gap dragon became a smaller monster with brighter green scales and thicker steam the good magician became a halfway handsome gnome of age fifty or so with a straightbr body and a solid head of hair but the trend did not stop there both progressed or regressed to childhood they both odd the gorgon said i suppose were lucky they didnt youthen into nothing both are over a century old thats probably all that saved them i used the emergency spell humfrey left me to conjure him back the baby magician disappeared from the image irene quelled her shock realizing that this was not youthening into nonex istence but simply the operation of the conjurationspell hum frey vanished from the scene in the mirror because he had appeared here in his castle hugo dismayed and confused began to cry the baby dragon shook itself looked about spread its fledgling wings and scooted away terrified the mirror image faded out irene turned to look again at the baby in the playroom it really is humfrey she breathed the gorgon sighed it really is and hugo is still out there he didnt seem to get any of the water on himself but thats about the only bright spot i cant tune in on him with the mirror because it is set on humfrey and i dont know how to retune it as soon as it realized humfrey was gone from the scene it quit the image i cant even go out to search for my lost son because irene realized that the gorgon was crying under her veil dragon on a pedestal she had been devastated in the last hour and needed help irene knew exactly how that feltbut was surprised to discover that the gorgon older and more experienced than irene and the most formidable woman in xanth when she lifted her veil was in fact less well equipped to handle such calamity than was irene herself physical or magical power did not serve as well at this moment as did emotional stability come sit down and well work this out irene said taking the gorgon by the elbow my child is out there too thats why i came here but obviously her mission had been in vain there would be no help from humfrey now the gorgon suffered herself to be guided soon they were in the kitchen the most comfortable place for married women sharing cups of t sweetened by the product of bs irene eyed a plate of cheeses one piece was huge with a mottled rind and when she reached for it it growled menac ingly dont take that the gorgon warned its monster cheese reserved for muenstersi mean monsters try this instead she turned the plate to present another type irene took a piece and chewed delicately its good what kind is it gorgonzola i make it myself i stare at it through my veil until its half petrified irene had to smile this was a useful incidental aspect of the gorgons dread talent now they got down to business first we must get a good babysitter for humfrey uh is there any known cure for magic youthening only timethe same as for the victim of a love spring the gorgon said sadly but im willing to wait knowing that in due course he will regain his full powers and be in the prime of life but what a wait that will be even if i get hold of some fountain of youth water myself so i can rejoin him in middle age and who will fill the role he does for xanth the outlook did look dismal usually there is some coun tercharm irene said if there were some substance or spell to reverse the effect to age him more rapidly only humfrey would know where to find that the gorgon said and he is the one who doesnt know now dragon on a pedestal it was an unfortunate irony irene shrugged and chewed her cheese unable to offer any other suggestions but ive got to rescue hugo the gorgon exclaimed did you say someone could come here and care for humfrey while im going out to find my son lacuna the zombie masters daughter will do nicely shes just sixteen and good with children irene suffered a retroactive regret that the twins debut had been so rudely shattered instead of a party there had been disaster oh yes i know lacuna a perfect imp of a child she used to print messages all over the castle things like never put off till tomorrow what you can do to day it seems funny in retrospect but it was annoying at the time irenes brow furrowed annoying it was printed on the toilet irene swallowed her chuckle wont even inquire what hiatus did to the bathroom hiatus talent was growing eyes ears noses and mouths from walls and other places lacuna was taking care of ivy and believe it was no fault of hers that ivy got lost the gap dragon it was hard to speak so objectively but it was necessary time was of the essence lacuna lived here as a child she surely knows how to stay out of trouble and where the facilities are she wont poke into the magicians spells irene had divided the good magician in her mind into two aspects the centuryplus old man he used to be and the baby who now existed the presence of the old humfrey would always be felt here no matter how long he was away you can give her any special pointers she needs the rest will come naturally that will free you to go out and fetch hugo with a clear conscience the obscure countenance behind the thick veil brightened now the gorgon had a positive program of action i dont know why didnt think of that myself she exclaimed well have to get lacuna here quickly irene continued that wilderness jungle is dangerous for children but there was no need to remind anyone of that ugly reality best not to dwell on it the carpets lost we dont know how to use humfreys stocked spells is there anything else dragon on a pedestal the gorgon considered the roc she said it will obey you now since you got past it it can fly very fast im sure it can irene agreed not much liking this idea but aware that it was probably best i will have to return to castle zombie to tell dor what has happened here then go after ivy myself ill help you the gorgon said we can go together combining our searches no use your sons lost at the fountain of youth my daughters lost near castle zombie i dont know how close the two are to each other i dont know either the gorgon admitted only humfrey knew the location of the fountain but it has to be somewhere in that region what about the zombie master irene asked you said he knew eight hundred years ago he knew but in his long tenure as a zombie he forgot all he remembered was that it did exist and somewhere in that area humfrey worked from there to pinpoint it precisely but humfrey must have told the gorgon shook her head that was not his way all too true the good magician had been notoriously tight fisted with information of any type to the frustration of others even kings since both ivy and hugo are in peril irene said well have to look for them separately you rescue yours ill rescue mineand pray were both successful yes the gorgon agreed faintly and irene realized that the woman had really wanted to make the search together probably she needed the moral support in this hour of crisis but it just didnt make sense in the circumstance they might find one child and lose the other will you be all right alone in the jungle irene asked solicitously the gorgon touched her veil suggestively who will chal lenge me there who indeed the gorgon had less to fear from monsters than did any other person then its agreed let me use the dragon on a pedestal roc to return to castle zombie and then it can bring lacuna here and then you can have it take you to the general region of the fountain which i think must be north of the castle thats the way humfrey went when he left yes the gorgon agreed oh irene youve been so much help i didnt know what to do until you came irene patted her hand reassuringly but inside she was not at all assured she had come here for helpand there was none humfreys horror had been added to her own chapter yak talk ivy looked around her she was in a nice jungle with many interesting things so she inspected each one in turn she realized something was in her hand and she put it in her pocket so it wouldnt distract her closest was a plant that smelled like a pickle but its branches and leaves were so hard as to be metallic what are you she inquired but the plant didnt answer she pouted she didnt like unresponsive things she walked on looking for something that would talk to her she heard a noise in the brush and discovered a large animal grazing it had homs like those of a sea cow a tail like that of a centaur and silky hair along its sides like that of a beautiful woman in short it was a strange composite creature but ivy was too young and inexperienced to realize how strange this animal was or to know proper fear she marched right up to it what are you she asked she had always found this question useful because when her father was near things always answered dragon on a pedestal the creature raised its head and stared down at her with a huge and lovely eye i thought youd never ask im a yak of course the most talkative of wild creatures i will talk your ear off if you dont figure out how to stop me ivy put a hand to her delicate little ear it seemed to be securely fastened so she relaxed how do i stop you she was rather pleased with her ability to assemble a question cor rectly after all she wasnt very big but she had discovered that she could do a lot more than she thought she could if she only believed she could she had decided to believe she could talk as well as a grownup person and now she could almost but she didnt do it when her folks were present in case they should object grownups had funny notions about what chil dren should or should not do so she had learned caution the yak shook his head not so readily cute human child that is the single thing i wont tell you it is my nature to talk as long as i have a receptive earan indifferent ear will do in a pinchregardless how anyone else feels about it you cant shut me up unless you know how what do you think of that ivy looked up at him youre a real pretty beast i like you the yak was taken aback you arent annoyed you talk to me most people dont they dont have time my folks dont know how well i can talk fortunately the yak seemed uncertain whether she was joking he twitched his homs well i have time i have nothing better to do than talk id rather talk than eat eat ivy realized she was hungry i want to eat i will talk about eating then but first we must introduce ourselves more formally what is your given name ivy im kmg dors child the yaks mouth curved into a tolerant smile ah royalty you will surely have royal tastes he was humoring her not believing her parentage what do you like ivy considered it was not that it took her any great cogi tation to come to a conclusion but that she enjoyed this par ticular type of consideration chocolate cake i never would have guessed as it happens theres a choc dragon on a pedestal olate moose in the vicinity but it doesnt like getting nibbled once a bunch of ducks started nibbling and it said i dont want to hurt anything ivy said sad for the moose now dont know what to eat then well just have to explore theres lots of succulent grass in this glade do you like that by way of illustration the yak took a mouthful of it ivy bent down and took a similar mouthful of grass she chewed a moment then spat it out no its too much like spinach there are also leaves the yak said reaching up to pull down a leafy branch ivy took a leaf and chewed it no too much like cabbage you are hard to please the yak lamented cheerfully lets look around more widely they walked back the way ivy had come whats that sheasked pointing to the metallic plant with the pickle smell that had refused to identify itself before why thats an armordillo the yak said it grows the best armor but it stinks of the brine used to store it some creatures like the odor though ivy wrinkled her cute little nose ugh they must be dil lies they are indeed they get pickled every night they moved on to a plant whose huge limbs terminated in delicate human hands each finger manicured and with bright polish on the nail whats that a ladyfingers plant naturally the yak said you have hands you can shake hands in the typical human fashion if you wish ivy tried it extending her right hand toward the nearest branch she could tell her right hand from her left because her hands lined up the same way her feet did and her shoes were marked r and l the nearest ladyfingers grasped her hand immediately but then all the other hands clamored for attention by snapping their fingers and she had to shake them all at length she drew away resolving to be more careful thereafter she started toward a somewhat vague bush whats that dragon on a pedestal dont go near that one the yak warned thats a trance plant it doesnt belong here at all why not it grows elsewhere probably someone carried it here and set it on the ground and it rooted anyone who gets too close to it gets dazed ivy considered she was a pretty smart little girl when she tried to be especially when she thought she was her fathers friend smash the ogre had said she might have had an eye queue vine fall on her head smash knew about jungle vines but that was their secret smash took her for walks sometimes and he had been quick to discover that she was smarter than she seemed sometimes because he was that way himself but he had promised not to tell her folks so she wouldnt get in trouble in fact it was because of smash that she wanted to explore the jungle he had told her how fascinating it was now she had her chance how did they carry the trance plant the yak paused why i never thought of that anyone carrying it would have gone into a trance yet i happen to know that all trance plants grow elsewhere and are moved to new locations it seems to be their lifestyle they must have some additional magic to enable them to travel he looked ahead ah theres a football as he spoke the football rolled into view it was a sphere formed of feet every kind of extremity showed in itdragon talons bird claws griffin paws human feet centaur hooves insect legs and so on the feet tramped down a path wherever it rolled so that it was easy to tell where the ball had been but not where it was going with so many feet it was able to travel quite swiftly and was soon out of sight however the path it left made their route easier since there were no brambles or pitfalls in it it didnt matter to ivy where it led as long as there were interesting things along it ivy spotted a glittering glassy ball the size of her two fists not round but carved with many small flat facets she strayed from the path long enough to pick it up beams of light corusca ted from it as she held it in a stray shaft of sunlight what is this dragon on a pedestal that is a very precious stone one of the gems distributed by jewel the nymph the yak said crystallized carbon in spherical form a very hard ball specifically a baseball dia mond whats it for its pretty people play stupid games with it i understand the main game is very tediousa bunch of players spread themselves out around the diamond and simply wait and someone else throws the ball and another stands with a stick resting on his shoulder and watches the ball go by him three or four times and then either he gets mad and quits trying or he runs around the diamond then they start over ivys smooth little brow furrowed in a fair emulation of her mothers expression at times like this thats no fun who does that mundanes mostly they are strange creatures and i sus pect not too bright otherwise they would take more of an interest in magic instead of pretending it doesnt exist what can you say about a person who refuses to believe in magic that he deserves his own dullness thats a most astute remark the yak glanced ahead hearing something hark i think i hear a game now they walked on toward the sound two centaurs were doing something no thats not a baseball diamond theyre throw ing it must be some other game indeed it was two wooden stakes had been pounded into the ground and the centaurs were taking turns hurling shoes from a nearby shoe tree at them they were the type of shoes human folk used with shoelaces and all one shoe would land leaning up against a stake but the next one would knock it away finally one centaur managed to hang a shoe up on the stake whereupon he clapped his hands and the other grimaced oh that makes you look so sick youll need a new croggle test the winner teased the loser equines need regular croggletests the yak explained pri vately to ivy to make sure they havent been infected by magic it is very bad to be croggled ivy felt a little croggled herself though she was not an equine some of her best friends were magicinfected centaurs dragon on a pedestal but she knew that most centaurs rejected magic as determinedly as the mundanes did what are you playing she called to the centaurs peopleshoes of course one of them responded absently then trotted off to pick up his collection the yak shrugged theres no accounting for tastes he remarked some folk like to talk some like to throw shoes ivy agreed it was a strange world she walked on the marvels of the land of xanth continued and the little girl spent all afternoon exploring them with the yaks helpful commentary continuing incessantly a passing milksnake gave her a bottle of milk to slake her thirst and she plucked a lollypop from a popsickle plant her only bad moment came when a big b buzzed her and she stumbled off the footpath the yak also stumbled for it was a bumble b causing creatures to become clumsy ivy wound up at the base of a large tree feeling terrible oooh ugh she exclaimed what hit me the yak looked none too sanguine himself but he peered about seeking the answer he found it the tree he ex claimed painfully its a torment pine we must get away from it ivy hobbled away and the farther from the tree she got the less worse she felt finally she got back to the footpath she had humbled from and felt well again she would be alert for any more bs so she would not stumble into any more trees but night was nigh and she was tired usually her mother irene curbed her long before her explorative instincts were sated so she got frustrated but not tired this time it was the other way around i want to go to bed she said and paused in momentary shock realizing she had spoken heresy no child ever wanted to go to bed so she qualified it i dont want the monster under the bed to be lonely then you should go home the yak pointed out home she asked baffled whats that the yak looked at her in perplexity that would be the place where your mother lives and your father the here the yak paused to smirk the king of xanth where you dragon on a pedestal stay when you dont have anything better to do where your bed is still her little brow furrowed where the yak was puzzled you mean to say you dont know how can you remember your mother and your bed without remembering your home ivy shook her head confused where did you come from before you met me she pondered dont remember how could you forget your own home the yak persisted dont know she began to cry the yak was disconcerted here ill find a bed bug they make very nice beds he began to cast about looking for a bed bug there was the faintest of swirls in the air not so much a breeze as the mere suggestion of motion ivy almost remem bered being near something like this before but not quite the yak intent on his mission walked right through that swirl he stopped looking perplexed what am i doing here he asked switching his tail youre my friend ivy said her sniffles abating for the moment youre looking for a i dont remember you the yak exclaimed i dont re member anything im lost alarmed he galloped off ivy stared after him it seemed she had found the way to shut him upbut she was not pleased she had lost her only immediate friend she walked along the path trying to catch up to the yak but he had forgotten her and was already out of sight once she thought she saw him but it was only the chocolate moose who was going in the opposite direction and didnt wait for her it was darkening now and the pleasant trees were turning ugly she ran and tripped over a root that lifted to snag her toe she skinned her knees in the fall and got dirt in her face this was too much ivy sat in the path and wailed she was after all only three years old something heard the noise and came toward her half slith dragon on a pedestal ering half whomping through the underbrush it had six legs and green metallic scales and it steamed and it was hungry ivy heard it and looked up in time to stare into the horrendous little countenance of the rejuvenated gap dragon chapter zora zomble irene was fuming she had as it turned out wasted precious time traveling to the good magicians castle and now she was losing more of course she had helped the gorgon and that was worthwhilebut what was happening to ivy meanwhile the xanth jungle was no place for a threeyear old child alone she glanced at the little plant perched in an upper pocket it was a miniature variety of ivy enchanted to relate to the child ivy as long as the plant was healthy so was ivy if the plant wilted that meant trouble or illness if the plant died irene shook her head the plant was healthy no point in worrying about what might be she knew her daughter was all right and had known it all along it was the future that worried her all she had to do was find her daughtersoon the roc deposited her at castle zombie wait here she told it therell be a return delivery she hurried inside millie the ghost came to meet her listen carefully irene said without preamble good magician humfrey has been turned into a baby and his son hugo is lost the gorgon will look for hugo but needs a babysitter for humfrey a roc is waiting outside to take lacuna there is that all right with you good go tell lacuna wheres dor out looking for ivy millie said taken aback by the rush dragon on a pedestal of information they all arebut theres so much jungle to search ill find him myself irene said impatiently you see to lacuna she hurried back outside leaving the older woman to her confusion actually she was sure lacuna would be thrilled to get roctransport that was a most unusual mode of travel for ordinary people wheres dor irene demanded of the nearest zombie the mottled face worked trying to assemble an answer a hand came up to scratch the nose and the nose fell off wwhhooo the creature whistled my husband irene snapped dor the king you im becile wheres the king decayed comprehension came kkemmm the thing said and pointed a skeletal extremity to the north thaankss irene said mimicking it though what scant humor the action might have had was wasted on a thing whose brain was glop she rushed north soon she encountered a centaur it was chem hello ir ene the filly called chem was a few years younger than irene but centaurs aged more slowly than human beings did so she was now in the flush of nubility in human terms chem would have been about the age of the twins hiatus and lacuna or a little older she was certainly an attractive specimen of her kind now with fair hair falling from her head to touch the equine shoulder and a full and bare bosom of the centaur kind of course chems appearance was nothing new to irene she had ridden the centaur from castle roogna to castle zombie a journey of several hours by hoof and longer by foot but she gained a clearer picture of chem seeing her standing alone in the forest this filly was currently well worth the attention of a male of her species but as far as irene knew there was no immediate prospect there were not many of the magicperforming cen taurs and the other kind would not have anything to do with them this meant unfortunately that chem had a quite rea sonable chance for spinsterhood attractive though she was oh ouch no irene exclaimed making a connection that zombie said chem instead of king dragon on a pedestal the centaur frowned whats the matter i was looking for my husband arent we all chem murmured frowning again but in an instant she smiled hes searching southside with chet can take you to them grundy says ivys not in this region anyway grundy irene asked blankly megrundy the golem the little creature said from the foot of a tree insolently pretending she did not remember him grundy seldom did anything politely that he could do impol itely and prided himself on being obnoxious but he did care and was a reliable aid in emergencies i came to help search chems taking me from glade to glade and im asking all the local flora he ran to rejoin chem who reached down to pick him up grundy was so small he could sit comfortably in her hand well take me to dor irene said mounting the centaur behind the golem she had never really liked grundy but had to concede that he could be useful at a time like this and it was nice of him to volunteer chem galloped south dodging around trees and boulders and hurdling ruts centaurs liked to run and they were good at it soon the threesome located king dor irene rattled out her story about the fate of the good ma gician so ive got to find my daughter myself she concluded she didnt even need to ask whether dor had found ivy she knew he had not she had known at the outset of this crisis in her heart that only she could handle it properly why else had she suffered the horrible vision that doesnt necessarily follow dor said with his an noying masculine reasonableness our search pattern should in due course succeed im her mother irene cried refuting all further argument the familiar look of male bafflement and resignation passed across his face well if you ride chem with grundy along it hadnt occurred to irene to join forces more permanently with the centaur and certainly not with the golem but actually that was not a bad idea especially if it allayed dors hesitancy drogon on o pedestal irene glanced at chem to see if she were amenable she was of course irene agreed as if that had been the intent from the start and take a zombie a zombie they know the area he pointed out and you can send it back to the castle if you get in trouble that is if you should need to send a message back he was correcting his slip naturally she would not be the one to get in trouble then the zombie master will know where to send assistance youre not objecting to my going irene asked just to make quite sure he knew he did not dear i know you work best in your own way ill return to castle roogna and consult with crombie and check the arsenal there should be something that will help in case you dont find ivy soon meanwhile with humfrey out of business i had better be available at home so youll know where to get in touch with me there is also the matter of the forgetwhorls to handle this did make some sense she had to concede she had anticipated more argument from him but evidently he was learning the uselessness of that he really would not be able to help locate ivy from castle roogna because though crom bie the soldiers talent lay in pointing out the direction of anything crombie was now so old and frail that his talent was unreliable but with dor safely back at castle roogna she would not have to worry about anything happening to him and could concentrate completely on the immediate mission ill keep going until i find ivy she promised it shouldnt be long she cant have wandered far true dor agreed wanly suddenly irene realized what his real motive washe was half afraid ivy was in deeper trouble than mere separation from her family and he wanted to locate some magic means to confirm or deny this without alarming irene herself he had an ivy plant of his own so knew the child was healthybut this disappearance was already more serious than it had first seemed with the forgetwhorls moving through the area taking out people ran domly dragon on a pedestal dor was letting her keep her hope as long as possible she would let him keep his irene kissed him in silent thanks for what he hadnt said then remounted chem you she said pointing to the nearest zombie come with us anything to satisfy her husband who was trying so hard to do what he thought was right the zombie would be a nuisance but maybe she would find ivy soon so it wouldnt matter the centaur started walking irene waved goodbye then turned her face forward knowing dor would be watching her as long as she remained in sight the designated zombie shuf fled along behind hey you plants grundy called any of you see a little girl pass by this afternoon this was for the others notice actual plant language was largely inaudible and wholly incom prehensible to the human ear the golem would repeat the message in the dialects of any plants and animals he saw after a pause grundy shook his head none here he reported but i guess we already knew that wed better circle around the castle until we pick up ivys trail its got to be here somewhere lets see a map of the area irene told chem we can pick the best route for circling the castle chem projected her map it formed in the air before her a threedimensional representation of castle zombie and the re gion around it but portions were fuzzy whats wrong with your picture horserump grundy asked his normal lack of diplomacy evident im not familiar with this region the centaur explained unruffled centaur stallions like human males could have bad tempers but the fillies were femininely stable i didnt have time to explore much of it before the dragon came i have to see it before i can map it then what good is your talent marebrain grundy de manded irene felt a tinge of ire at his insolence but kept her mouth shut chem could take care of herself i never get lost ragbrain chem said evenly actually the golems original head had been wood not rag but it was a fair insult now of course grundy was alive with a living dragon on a pedestal brain once ive been to a place ive got it on my map so i can always find my way back the golem realizing that insult would be met with insult shut up and concentrated on his business they circled castle zombie clockwise threequarters of the way around grundy picked up the trail they had actually spiraled out somewhat and were now a fair distance from the castle this armordillo plant saw her pass grundy exclaimed he pointed east that way irene controlled her thrill of joy they hadnt completed the rescue yet odd direction to go chem remarked didnt you say you saw the zombie carry her west not east thats right irene agreed her gratification at finding the trail tempered by this surprise she couldnt have wandered all the way around the castle ask the dillo how ivy arrived chem told grundy the golem queried the plant using a series of rustlings and creakings and picklecrunching sounds she just toddled up from the direction of the castle he reported she didnt look as if shed walkedfar irene hesitated athwart a dilemma she wanted to recover her lost child as soon as possible but knew that in the xanth wilderness it was best to take no mystery on faith if she found how how ivy had traveled this far she might have an important clue to where she was going wed better check this she decided hoping she wasnt wasting critical time on something irrelevant go back and trace how ivy got here you know its late grundy reminded her if shes caught out here at night i know irene agreed i dread that but this may be important theres a mystery here that may have bearing how ever she got from west of the castle to east of the castle she may do it again to get somewhere else while we are looking in the wrong place the golem shrugged his tiny shoulders its her funeral irene suppressed the urge to hurl the miniature man into the dragon on a pedestal nearest tangle tree just ask the plants she said between her teeth chem moved toward the castle grundy queried the vege tation along the way they havent seen her here he reported the group backtracked checking more closely the zombie who had been dutifully trailing the centaur did its best to help peering into the bushes on either side ivys trail commenced near the armordillo the plants there said she had walked from the west but the plants to the west did not remember her something extremely peculiar here chem said she cant be traveling intermittently irene spotted something in a nearby field it was a large animal for an instant her chest tightened then she saw it was a grazing creature not a carnivore maybe thatwhatever it issaw ivy she said chem looked thats a moose a vanillano a chocolate moose harmless they went over and grundy questioned the moose the animal looked up warily it wants to know if were ducks grundy said with disgust it doesnt like ducks who nibble tell it to stop ducking the question irene said after a moment the golem reported that the moose had seen a child of the proper description but not here she had been some distance to the east going the other way farther along irene said at least we know she was all right then well go there soon right now i want to know why her trail is intermittent here they resumed the backtrack grundy narrowed it down to two blades of grass the eas t one remembered ivy and said she had come from the west the west blade denied it soon the two were in an argument and then in a fight one blade slashed at the other but was parried and countered in moments the surrounding blades chose sides and joined the fray the field became a battlefield this is getting us nowhere irene protested dancing about to avoid getting slashed on the ankles one of those gay blades must be lying dragon on a pedestal no grass is inferior grundy said it doesnt have the wit to lie it just stands tall and defends its turf but their stories directly contradict they cant both be true now chems fine centaur mind came into play she suffered less distraction from the blades because her hooves were in vulnerable they couldif a forgetwhorl passed a forgetwhorl there was the answer of course it had blotted out the trail for the plants it had affected had no memory of events preceding the passage of the whorl but that means that it could have touched ivy too chem finished i had hoped that wouldnt be the case but without memory the prospect was appalling though irene had also thought of it before she just hadnt wanted to believe it not even to remember the dangers but the whorl could have passed after ivy did chem pointed out so it didnt hurt her just wiped out a section of her trail yes irene agreed relieved or maybe it just grazed her making her forget a little such as how to get home without really hurting her that was stretching probability somewhat but was a better theory than nothing it was possible irene reminded herself fiercely we shall trace her quickly the centaur reassured irene cutting off the questionable speculations they all knew how deadly the wilderness ofxanth could be even when a persons memory was intact let me try one more thing grundy said that buckeye over there is to the east of the forgetline and those bucks eye everything that passes them especially if its in a skirt maybe it saw ivy come in and wasnt in the path of the whorl good idea chem agreed ask it the golem sent out a mooselike honk at the tree in the distance the chocolate moose looked up startled then realized this call was not for it the trees antlerlike branches twitched eyelike formations in the trunk blinked it honked back grundy became excited he honked again the tree re dragon on a pedestal sponded with a considerable passage of rustlings and wood noises the golem translated the buck says he eyed this region four hours ago and saw a magic carpet glide in carrying a bag and a child thats no way to refer to a woman irene snapped a bag of spells grundy clarified and irene blushed she had waded into that one a carpet chem said that could only be humfreys carpet irene exclaimed it escaped when the gap dragon attacked him it must have come down nearivy chem said these carpets may spook but they always return they dont know what to do by themselves but why didnt it return to hum frey he was gone irene said the gorgon conjured him home hugo must have wandered away so the carpet simply went looking for them when it spied ivy it dropped down to see if she was its owner chem fin ished and ivy took a ride on it just for fun she would irene agreed grimly she has very little sense of danger when she gets interested by something she inherits that from her father the centaur glanced askance at irene but did not comment and she picked up a goodluck charm grundy added the buckeye saw that happen too goodluck charm irene asked then how could she have gotten caught by the forgetwhorl the tree didnt see that grundy said naturally not the whorls are invisible but the whorl may have missed her chem pointed out we know only that it passed here perhaps soon after she did not that it got ivy the goodluck charm could have fended it off or at least diminished its effect depending on how strong the charm was if her continuing trail remains purposeful we can assume that she wasnt really hurt by the whorl i dont know irene said worried things dont always happen the way they should here in xanth dors father draon on a pedestal bink but that was another subject bink had always been amazingly lucky needing no charm we do know a whorl got the zombie who carried her from the path of the gap dragon chem said glancing at the zombie who patiently followed them now this was a different zombie the patterns of rot were dissimilar not that it mattered one zombie was very much like another there must be a number of whorls around striking randomly probably the whorls followed the dragon from the gap irene agreed the dragon should be immune to them having lived in the ambience of the original forgetspell for centuries there could be an affinity because of that long association anyway we seem to have solved the riddle of ivys departure she flew the carpet to this side of the castle but shes on foot now the carpet evidently took off again when she got off it and is lost we need to catch up to her before before nightfall chem supplied diplomatically they followed the trail more quickly now the golem elic iting a report from a ladyfingers plant that used hand signals to describe a human child and a huge animal animal irene asked alarmed perhaps the chocolate moose chem suggested grundy conversed further with the local plants while the ladyfingers wrung their hands in distress at not being able to identify the creature but another plant recognized the type a yak the golem finally reported they like to talk theyre generally harmless unless they talk your ear off stroke of luck her running into that particular animal the goodluck charm chem said obviously she had it with her though she may not have recognized its significance it brought her a fortunate wilderness companion after fending off the forgetwhorl or most of it but those charms only last a few hours when used irene said worriedly they only have so much power and each intercession of good luck depletes their charge ivy must have needed a lot of luck out here so the charm will be exhausted by nightfall the centaur glanced at the sky we have another hour yet we can move faster than she could well find her fat cha grundy started to remark with his normal cal dragon on a pedestal culated insensitivity but was interrupted by a coincidental cough from the centaur that almost dislodged him uh yes sure they went on tracing the trail along a footpath and past a centaurgame region if only the centaurs had realized ivy was lost chem said i know they would have carried her right back to the castle zombie the lucky charm was fading irene said grimly there was a warning rumble of thunder a storm was headed their way they hurried they passed a torment pine then just beyond it the trail stopped no plant remembered anything another forgetwhorl irene exclaimed or maybe the same one rolling along it blotted out everythings memory those whorls dont seem to be large chem said we should be able to pick up the trail on the other side of it im sorry we didnt think to bring along some of that whorlnul lifying potion humfrey gave you haste always does make waste irene said the thunder rumbled again louder it sounded like the cloud irene had disciplined with the watermelon seeds and that could mean trouble the inanimate wasnt very smart but it was very omery the cloud must have rounded up reinforcements and returned to the fray soon they found the trailbut it was only the yak do yaks leave their companions irene asked not while those companions are still able to listen chem said a yak will never voluntarily stop talking yeah you have to know how to shut it up grundy put in how do you do that irene asked the golem shook his little head no one knows ivy surely didnt knowand even if she did she wouldnt she likes conversation irene frowned i only wish she were willing to talk more herself she listens to me but she doesnt say much sometimes i worry about her being retarded like like hugo not that bad of course irene said hastily im sure ivy dragon on a pedestal will talk when she gets around to it shes only three years old after all but that tinge of uncertainty remained something must have happened to her grundy said the forgetwhorl chem interjected before irene could get more upset it must have touched the yak and the animal forgot ivy and wandered away irene relaxed yes of course we must backtrack then cast about for ivys trail there was a detonation of thunder that made them all jump then a stiff gust of wind and the rain began this was definitely the fragment of the king of clouds restored to power by the moisture of the evening and a host of satellite clouds now it was getting even with irene and she was not in a position to do anything about it she ground her teeth in private ireshe didnt like being bested by water vapor the trail will have to wait a little chem said we arent going to be able to trace anything in the storm yeah itll be a real drenchpour grundy said enthusias tically i wonder who antagonized that cloud they dont zero in like this for no reason with bad grace irene took out a seed grow she directed it and an umbrella plant sprouted its broad leaves spread out in an overlapping pattern creating a watertight shelter soon it grew large enough to protect the three of them just in time for this was indeed a drenchpour water came down in traveling sheets doing its best to blow in sidewise oh that cloud was angry irene had to grow a wallflower to wall it off but they were soaked before the flower completed its growth rivulets washed across their feet chem excavated channels with her hooves to drain the water but now the ground was so soggy that it was no pleasure to stand on irene grew rockroses in lieu of chairs for herself and grundy but then itchgnats swarmed in as they did when people were vulner able and she had to grow a giant toad plant to snap them up the trouble was the toad also snapped at dangling curls of irenes green hair and chems blond tail mistaking them for flies or spiders dangling on threads all in all it was an un comfortable situation the zombie stood just outside the shelter having no need dragon on a pedestal of it and knowing that its kind wasnt wanted inside the sluicing rain carried bits and pieces of the creature away but it never seemed to lose mass that was the thing about zombies they were forever shedding their spoiled flesh yet always had more to shed it was one of the less appetizing types of magic in xanth but irene knew how loyally the zombies had defended castle roogna through many crises freely sacrificing whatever sort of lives they had when any trouble came they were the ultimate selfless creatures and she remembered how a zombie justice of the peacemaybe that was piece because of the way he had been falling aparthad agreed to officiate when she married dor zombies were good people despite being rotten still the rain came settling in for a long seige obviously the storm meant to pin them down for the night hell had no fury like that of an angry cloud she reflected for hell was full of fire while the cloud was full of water irene didnt like being pinned down the wilderness was especially dangerous at night maybe the king cloud hoped something bad would happen to her while she was pinned but she couldnt go home as long as ivy was out here alone something had to be done irenes teeth were chattering with developing chill that cloud had reached high in the cold sky to find icy water she used the last remaining light of day to grow a candle plant lighting it with a small flamevine that provided enough artificial light for her to grow a few staples most plants wouldnt grow in the dark they required the energy of sunlight but her talent could force the issue with a few with the artificial light she managed to grow a towel plant with fine dry towels for all so they could dry off and abate the chill since irene had to strip to use her towel she grew a curtain plant to give her some privacy actually she wasnt sensitive about being seen by chem as centaurs had little personal modesty and anyway chem was female she showed all the time what irene was showing only now but grundy was another matter he would make obnoxious remarks not because he had any real interest but because that was his nature he would feel in adequate if he let such an occasion pass by without some ob dragon on pedwtol servation about cheesecake or the erosion of birthday suits and his big mouth would be active when he encountered other males subsequently irene knew it was foolish of her to pay any attention to such nonsense but she did once dry she wrapped two towels about her and pinned them with pins from another pincushion plant the towels would have to do as clothing till morning when she could grow a sunflower to dry her regular clothing and a ladyslippers plant to replace her sodden footwear she grew a cheese plant and a breadfruit and a chocolate plant before the last natural light faded these would suffice for supper it was a miserable sit uation but they could endure it for one night irene hoped her husband dor wasnt worrying too much he seemed to think she would not survive by herself it was one of the halfway charming male notions he retained she missed him already there in snug castle roogna with the dry floor and friendly ghosts and the continuing entertainment of the magic tapestry but she missed ivy more that sweet innocent inexperi enced child lost in this jungle her child irene touched the ivy plant she wore only its continued health reassured her that her daughter remained well without that assurance irene would have been forging through the night regardless of the danger desperately searching for what she might never find she was none too sanguine as it was but the ivy made the situation bearable she saw the zombie at the fringe of the flickering candle light it looked miserable out there of course zombies were always miserablelooking with one foot pretty much in the grave a zombie would rest literally in the grave some of them slept for centuries quietly decaying and only roused them selves to throw off their blanket of dirt when summoned by some strange awareness of need for their services still the sight of this one bothered her are you hungry she asked it hhunnggh the thing said hungry eat food irene extended a piece of cheese not knowing whether such things ever ate the zombie reached a gangrenous hand to accept it irene dragon on a pedestal forced herself not to flinch away from the contact ffooodh the creature said yes to eat irene illustrated by taking a delicate bite of her own piece of cheese though now her appetite had dimin ished considerably the zombie tried it three teeth crumbled and a segment of lip fell off the firm cheese was impervious to the creatures feeble effort at mastication i suppose not irene said controlling the roiling of her stomach i really dont know much about zombies none of us do chem agreed they are not like us if that is not a ludicrous understatement easy enough to find out grundy said perceiving an op portunity for mischief i can talk to the things as readily as to anything else though they arent strictly alive its one place where king dors talent overlaps mine he can talk to them because they arent quite alive and i can talk to them because they arent quite dead he smiled with happy malice what intimate girlish secrets do you wish to exchange with this one well irene discovered that she really wasnt very cu rious about zombies they were such appalling things pan of the horror was the thought that someday she could find herself animated as a similar creature if she happened to die in the vicinity of castle zombie death was never fun to contemplate and this kind of halfdeath was worse there was a low hissing roar from the damp darkness beyond the shelter thats a bonnacon grundy exclaimed with alarm id know that noise anywhere sounds more like a dragon to me chem said swishing her tail nervously the bonnacon is a dragon horserace the golem re sponded it has the horns of a bisonthats a mythical mun dane animaland the posterior ofwell lets just say its worse going than coming dragons eat people irene reminded them and i cant grow many plants in the dark were in trouble youd better grow something because the thing has winded us grundy warned the bonnacon is too big and fast for us to escape it we have to fight it off dragon on a pedestal with pieces of cheese irene demanded we need a weapon and doubt my knife will chem unslung her bow pinpoint its location and ill shoot it she said no good ponytail the golem said your arrows would only annoy it weve got to have a tough plant like a boxwood or tangler not at night irene said right now all i can grow is night bloomers then grow the night bloomers grundy cried the mon sters almost upon us irene heard the most horrendous rasp of the dragons breath she was not the most timid of women but now she was ter rified her mind numb she tossed down a seed grow maybe we can make a lot of noise and scare it off chem said no good grundy replied when the bonnacon retreats it blows out its whole quantity of digestive refusein simpler language its spare us your vernacular irene said we understand what the stuff is right into the faces of its pursuers the golem continued with a certain enthusiasm the stuff not only stinks to high heaven its so strong it sets fire to trees but if we cant escape the monster and we dont scare it off the centaur said understandably concerned thats why we need irenes fighting plants something that will balk the dragon without really frightening it so it will go away peacefully thats the key we must discourage it without annoying it lots of luck irene muttered look at them she moved the candle to illuminate what she had grown my night bloom ers there they wereseveral sets of delicately tinted feminine bloomerpanties the kind worn at night or under voluminous skirts grundy worked his little face in an effort not to guffaw now if we can just get them on the dragon he said a dragon on a pedestal smirk was obviously scrambling around in his head trying to get out through his face bloomers to prevent the dragons voiding from splattering them the notion was ludicrous the people would be eaten long before the bloomers could do any such thing and the dragons refuse would bum out the bloomers on the way by yet the idea had a certain foolish appeal a dragon in bloomers that was almost as nonsensical as irenes vision of a dragon on a pedestal now the huge homed head of the bonnacon became dimly visible in the fringe of candlelight there were flickering high lights on every giant tooth irene saw immediately that though this dragon lacked steam or fire it was far too formidable for them to fight even its eyes had metalbone lids that would probably stop chems arrows they were helpless before it irene got ready to scream though she detested this sort of useless feminine reaction sometimes there was no alternative the dragon nudged forward the zombie interposed itself between the sheltered party and the monster schtopf it cried blowing out a piece of tongue speech was not easy for zombies the bonnacon never even hesitated it snapped up the zom bie the huge and awful jaws crunched together the zombie squished and putrid juices squirted out the dragon paused an expression of distaste spread slowly across its chops in much the same manner as a like expression had spread across the face of the gap dragon when it crunched the stink bomb then the bonnacon spat the zombies body out ugh it groaned understandably there was nothing delicious about a squished zombie the zombie landed under the umbrella a sorry mess the dragon turned and tromped elsewhere looking for better food it did not spray out its firestarted refuse since it was not frightened it just departed in disgust the bonnacon thinks were all zombies irene breathed you do sort of look like one grundy informed her help fully in a towel yet probably true irenes hair was plastered to her head and body and the towels could be mistaken for ragged clothing dragon on a pedestal there were so many zombies in this region near castle zombie that the confusion was natural the zombie had saved them by discouraging the dragon but at what cost irene was not exactly partial to zombies but she did appreciate the sacrifice this one had made if it werent for the zombie irene herself would have been crunched by the jaws of the monster the creature had acted with courage and dispatch when all other hope was goneand had paid the terrible price she knelt to inspect the zombie it was in a sad statebut all zombies were in a sad state they were the walking undead perpetually decaying without ever quite collapsing usually it took complete dismemberment to put a zombie all the way out ofcommisssion if this one were typical it might survive are you she asked balking at the words alive or dead zombies as grundy had clarified werent exactly either hhurrtsh the thing replied faintly its still functional chem said surprised she says it hurts grundy translated for the zombie of course it hurts irene snapped her diffidence van ished and she grabbed a spare towel and used it to mop up the pus and saliva and juice that covered the body shes just been crunched by irene paused she sure shes your kind the golem said didnt you know no i didnt realize irene said taken aback shes so uh far gone it wasnt obvious but now as she wiped the torso she saw that it was true there were what once had been female attributes there i hadnt realized either chem said soberly naturally there would be females of their kind as well as males the zombie master can reanimate anything that once lived the zombie tried to sit up hey dont do that irene protested youve just been terribly crunched by a dragon youryour blood spurted out your bones must be broken youre lucky youreanimate ah you cant kill a zombie grundy said you can hack it to pieces but the pieces will slowly draw together and reas semble magic makes a zombie function not biology maybe so irene said grimly but this one just saved our dragon on a pedestal lives and shes not so far gone she cant experience pain and human sensitivity weve got to do something for her i agree chem said but what can be done for a zombie ask her grundy irene said and ask her name chem added it had not occurred to irene that a zombie would have a name now she chided herself for the way she had dehumanized them in her mind zombies were after all peopleor had been before dying and becoming undead the golem issued a series of slushy syllables and decaying particles the zombie responded with coughs and chokes and noises that sounded like garbage being sucked down a half clogged sewer drainhole she says her name is zora grundy reported in due course she killed herself about fifteen years ago when her true love was false her folks took her body to the zombie master and he animated her shes been serving him since she would prefer to be alltheway dead or fully alive but neither is pos sible so she just muddles along she says its a living well thats not precisely it but the term doesnt translate well surely it didnt what an awful thing it must be irene thought to be forever half dead yes but how can we help her she demanded of the golem there must be something the golem interrogated zora zombie again the only thing that brings her kind closer to life is love he reported some living man must truly love her to counteract the evil of the one who did not then she would be almost human as long as his love lasted chem whistled that is a difficult thing nobody loves a zombie most men prefer their women young and er whole some yes i know irene said i was that way once then i got married she smiled but it wasnt entirely a joke marriage had brought new responsibilitiesand ivy marriage had been the end of her nymphly existence and the beginning of a ma tronly one but she wouldnt trade it well well try to help zora zombie somehow she certainly deserves it irene put her hand to the zombies bony shoulders no longer repelled by the contact and helped her sit up whatever healing dragon on a pedestal processes occurred in zombies were operating now and soon zora was back on her feet and stumbling about in her normal fashion she moved out into the falling rain where she seemed to be the least uncomfortable if there is anything i personally can do irene called to zora still feeling inadequate i believe you have already done it chem murmured done what extended a little human caring thats why she mended so rapidlyand may continue to improve if such treatment continues irene was taken aback and hardly pleased with herself she knew she had been treating the zombie with contempt before could any amount of decent treatment make up for that well she would find out i suppose wed better sleep irene said we cant do anything now and were probably as safe here as anywhere the others agreed they lay down on towels and bloomers and tried to sleep zora flopped on a wet rock outside the umbrella shelter irene was not at all comfortable physically or mentally but she was a realist she would endure what he must to get her child back alive no price was too great she thought she would lie awake all night but somehow she didnt not quite she thought if she did sleep she would have bad dreams however it seemed the local night mare was not paying attention and no bad dreams came chapter coventree i he baby gap dragon was only a fraction of its adult size and not much more than triple ivys mass but its primary features were intact it had six legs a sinuous tail a set of wings too small to enable it to fly and a horrendous head full of teeth its scales were metallic a rather pretty green with iridescent highlights and the tip of its tail was knifelike the dragon eyed ivy it slavered its tongue slopped around its face moistening its teeth and making them gleam a jet of pure clean white steam issued from its throat big creatures were now too much for the dragon to tackle but ivy was little and succulent it was ready to feast ivy looked the dragon in the snout she clapped her hands with girlish glee oh goody she exclaimed in delight a playmate the dragon paused this was not it suspected the proper reception accorded its kind by lone human beings of any size its memory of its adult life had been excised along with its age so it could not remember any prior encounters with this life form but its basic instincts were more important than its memory anyway it was geared to chase down a terrified and fleeing morsel to steam it into a tasty halfcooked state to crunch it into digestible chunks soaked in delicious blood to swallow the delectable pieces then to burp afterward and take a pleasant nap it was also geared to flee anything larger than itself or more dangerous such as a man with an enchanted sword creatures of approximately its own size and ferocity it would fight establishing territorial prerogatives it was vaguely dragon on a pedestal aware that it had once possessed an excellent private territory but it had no idea now where this was that hardly mattered here because it faced prey not a monster similar to itself but the dragon lacked experience and instincts relating to friendly receptions what was the proper response ivy walked up to it fearlessly my very own pet dragon she cried green like mommys hair to be my friend and companion and to guard me when im afraid she reached out to pat the ugly snout what a lovely creature the dragon was not at all reassured in fact it found itself athwart a dilemma chase flee or fight none of the signals matched a pattern no one had ever called it lovely before or patted it on the snout so it remained stationary taking no action a nervous waft of steam puffed from it nice steam ivy said youre a steamer so your name is stanley she had been told tales of strange funny mun dania where impossible things existed such as metal machines that traveled on wheels and people who had no magic she wasnt good at comprehending impossibilities but she had an apt memory for names stanley steamer she repeated youre wonderful ivy was indulging in a simple but subtle process of iden tification and transference first she was a creature of love for love had always abounded in her family so naturally love radiated from her she bestowed on her toys and pets and friends the kind of unquestioning love she received herself also she was aware of the way men treated women as ex emplified by her fathers handling of her mother king dor placed queen irene on a pedestal irene complained about it often but was privately rather pleased ivy had spent many hours of many days searching castle roogna for that pedestal but it seemed to be invisible like the ghosts finally she had realized that it was magic like the monsterunderthebed that only she could see king dor was able to put queen irene on the pedestal that no one else could see or feel and irene could not get off it complain as she might it was a special enchant ment he could perform ivy liked enchantment so she had tried to develop her own invisible pedestal on which she could place her friends she had by diligent effort perfected it but had dragon on a pedestal lacked a suitable friend for it smash the ogre was really too big to fit on it but now she had a suitable prospect and so she placed her new friend stanley on it he was the very best of all the little dragons she knew stanley like ivys mother was not entirely comfortable on that pedestal but again like her mother he was not entirely displeased there were things to be said in favor of pedestals and he was the right size for this one what made ivys pedestal especially effective was her talent of enhancement whatever traits a person or creature possessed in her eyes became more pronounced powerful durable and good when she had noted how well her mother grew plants her mother had grown them even better when ivy had met the friendly talkative yak the creature had become more friendly and helpful now ivy per ceived how handsome and nice stanley steamer really was stanley suffered a period of disorientation as was normal for creatures abruptly discovering themselves on pedestals he hadnt known his name was stanley he hadnt known he was wonderful certainly he hadnt known he was lovely then the full power of ivys magic took over for it was magiciancaliber sorcery the kind of power few mortals comprehended and the dragon became exactly what she perceived him to beher handsome and loyal friend playmate and pet like many a male before him he succumbed to the enchantment of a sweet little female without even knowing the nature of her sorcery he was not aware that he had lost a battle of remarkable sig nificance he didnt even know there had been a battle because his natural instincts had no guidelines for this role he had to accept hers he was precisely what she wanted ivy because she was what she was a creature of love and innocence and unsuspected power had in an instant tamed one of the most formidable monsters of xanththe gap dragon no one had ever done that before some people might have considered it a miracle but it was not it was merely an early indication of ivys own formidability which was allied to that of her grandfather bink you must have very hard scales ivy said tapping the scales of stanleys neck and now they were metalhard such pretty colors too and the colors intensified manifesting as dragon on a pedestal elegant shades of green and blue and gray with iridescent spar kles stanley was now so pretty as to smite the unwary eye oh youre such a nice dragon she hugged him about the neck and kissed his green ear bemused the dragon accepted her embrace had he not been so hardscaled and prettycolored he might have melted right into the ground for ivys affection was a very special thing quite apart from her magic and such nice hot steam she continued stanley jetted a superheated jet much hotter than he had ever managed be fore ivys attention soon wandered for she was after all only a little girl without any great store of attention she hardly needed it im hungry arent you stanley agreed that he was hungry by nodding his head making the scales of his neck glitter nicely in fact now he was ravenous then we must find some food ivy decided for supper she looked about stanley sighed privately ivy herself was the most delicious possible morsel but he could no longer even think of that without wincing no one would consume her while he was on guard nearby was a crabapple tree with quite a number of ripe crabs gee i bet those are good she said reaching for one but the crab snapped at her with its huge pincer and she hastily withdrew her hand she had learned the hard way about things that pinched back at castle roogna still those crabs looked awfully good i know she de cided for she prided herself on her ability to solve problems when she tried indeed that ability had intensified to do justice to her pride mommy cooks crabs in hot water then they dont snap she had not realized before this moment why her mother went through the ritual with the water putting hot peppers into the pot to bring the liquid to the boiling point then dumping in the crabs it was a significant revelation worthy of ivys effort but she didnt have any hot water in fact she had no water at all and no hot peppers to heat it ivy pondered and in a dragon on a pedestal moment she came up with a solution for she was trying to be a precocious child stanley your hot steam can cook them then we can both eat stanley looked at the crabapple tree not understanding he did not need to steam crabs he could crunch them raw without difficulty their meat became his flesh and their shells became his scales in the natural order of assimilation oh come on ivy said encouragingly i know youre smarter than that the dragon discovered he was smarter than he had thought and now he understood her notion she could not crunch crabs live and raw stanley positioned himself before the crabapple tree and sent forth a jet of sizzling steam it touched a crab whose greenish shell instantly ripened to bright apple red and the creature fell to the ground ivy picked it upand dropped it for it was hot she stuck her fingers in her mouth unscorching them then she made do she used a section of her ivygreen skirt to protect her fingers and picked the crab up again it smelled delicious but she didnt know how to crack open the shell as she had no nutcracker then she looked at stanleys gleaming teeth and had another bright idea you can crack it she exclaimed she poked the cooked crab into the comer of the dragons mouth where the chewing teeth were stanley crunched down slowly until the shell cracked then he eased up and she took the crab back the problem had been solved she picked out the meat and chewed it yes its very good she said cook some for yourself stanley stanley shrugged and steamed several more crabs and chewed them up shells and all he discovered that they were good this way too his horizon had been broadened now he knew how to eat cooked as well as raw meat in due course both girl and dragon were satisfied but now night was closing more insistently i guess mommy hasnt found me yet and daddys busy with something more important ivy remarked unconcerned she knew queen irene would show up when it suited her convenience it wasnt often the woman forgot about bedtime though we must find a good place to sleep drogon on a pedestal the dragon of course normally slept anywhere he wanted to no other creature would attack him but he was much smaller and less experienced than he had been and was daunted by the threat of darkness how would he escape the monster under the bed if he had no bed to climb on so if ivy believed it was necessary to find a good place to sleep then it must be true they walked on seeking a good place they came to a tree on which grew not crabs but small men stanley wafted an experimental cloud of steam at it in case the men were edible and a number of them turned red and dropped off they had been steamed but they were not cooked each fallen man bounded to his feet and a company of them gathered below the tree oh babies ivy exclaimed perceiving that each wore diapers this is an infanttree these were pretty tough babies each had a helmet and a little sword or spear now they scowled and marched their weapons extended threateningly stanley wafted more steam at them but the troops of the infanttree forged on using little shields to deflect the steam their red color was that of anger not of ripening or cooking i think wed better run ivy said intelligently your scales are tough stanley but my skin is tender because im a cute little girl anyway its getting too dark stanley wasnt certain of the logic of all this but knew he wasnt as smart as she was since thinking wasnt normally the prerogative of dragons yet he understood what she wanted they found the trunk of another tree this one was huge it would have taken ivy some time just to walk around the base climbing over its monstrous buttressing roots the fo liage was dense an impenetrable mass that spread out almost horizontally near the bottom wed be safe up there ivy decided but how can we get up they were in luck behind the tree was a crane the bird had long thin legs and a long thin neck and a long thin bill it was a large bird so that when it stood up straight its head disappeared into the leaves of the tree indeed it was engaged in lifting stones from the ground to the foliage cranking up its head in slow measured stages dragon on a pedestal ivy paused watching this procedure she concentrated and finally figured it out the bird was practicing rockytree the troops of the infanttree were in hot pursuit delayed only by the shortness of their stride and by their need to detour more widely around the projecting roots than ivy and stanley had to do ivy didnt waste time mister crane will you lift us up into the tree she asked ill give you she hesitated searching about herself for something to offer for she knew that it was proper to give favors for favors she found a metal disk in her pocket and brought it out this the crane peered at the disk the disk gleamed in the last slanting beam of daylight the crane was charmed for it liked bright things it accepted the disk then hooked its bill into ivys skirtband and hoisted her up into the foliage she spun dizzily with the sudden elevation but grabbed the branches as they came within reach and scrambled up into the soft darkness of the leaves the cranes bill descended hooked onto stanleys tail and hoisted him up similarly soon he was with her again which was just as well because she was nervous about being alone in the dark it was almost completely night in the tree but there were many soft leaves so ivy arranged a bunch of them by feel into a bed that was comfortable enough she couldnt see the ground so she didnt worry about falling stanley formed a nest of his own and curled up snout to tail in the fashion of his kind in moments they were both asleep there was a terrible storm during the night but the massed leaves channeled the water around so that ivy and stanley did not get wet and were only dimly aware of the deluge ivy drew her leafblanket more tightly about her and stanley snorted a waft of steam both were glad to be high and dry few expe riences are cozier than being nicely sheltered from bad weather in the morning it took ivy a little while to remember where she was at first she thought she was home in bed but the color wasnt right her bedroom was pink with climbing ivy plants that her mother had grown for her this place was green dragon on a pedestal with faint pink swatches of light where a few bold sunbeams poked through and of course she had no pet dragon at home stanley she exclaimed with joy reaching across to give him a hug youre such a nice dragon the baby gap dragon woke with a startled snort of steam switching his tail his middle set of legs fell through the foliage and he had to scramble for a moment to recover secure footing they were after all up a tree but he was also much nicer than he had been i like this tree ivy decided lets stay up here stanley who had discovered that he liked being hugged by a cute little girl agreed ivy looked for a bathroom but found none she discovered though that anything she did dropped harmlessly through the floor of foliage and out of sight and out of mind so that was no problem birds did it after all no wonder they found trees so convenient next she looked for a kitchen with no better success but there were assorted fruits and nuts dangling within reach so she plucked and ate them stanley wasnt sure about this form of sustenance but at her urging he consumed a bunch of red hot pepper fruits and found them delicious he liked hot stuff it helped heat his steam just as effectively as it heated ivys mothers water then he ate some of the more juicy fruits for he also needed liquid from which to generate his steam now they moved on through the tree exploring foliage was everywhere making this a jungle in itself but there was a certain pattern to it the branches twisted generally upward and the layers of leaves became firmer at the higher levels this was vaguely like an enormous house with many floors and walls and ramps it seemed to extend forever stanley had no trouble for his body was long and low and sinuous but ivy felt nervous on the smaller branches finally they reached the highest level where the sun shone down and here the network of branches was so thick and so intertwined and the leaves so many and strong that the visitors could safely walk anywhere the top of the tree was roughly level with the mounds of individual branches resembling hills the outermost boughs rose higher to form a kind of retaining dragon on a pedestal wall that prevented them from falling off the leaves were of varied colors here too so that it was more like a regular landscape there were some large individual leaves projecting from the nether mass of the treescape with black patterns on them the nearest one was marked welcome to coventree and below it a smaller leaf was marked do not litter ivy was too young to read and the gap dragon had never learned how so they ignored these leaves ahead was a series of leafy cages containing strange ani mals the signleaf by the first said giants inside were several huge and strange insects each as big as ivy herself their bodies resembled those of ant lions but their heads were strange ivy pondered a moment then managed to remember where she had seen creatures like these before in a pic ture she exclaimed in a book of weird mundane mon sters mommy called them ants they must be a crossbreed of ant lions and and but here she stalled she could not figure out what could account for the changed heads but thought they were smaller stanley peered at the odd creatures as fascinated as ivy was one of the huge ants snapped its mandibles at the dragon and stanley jetted some steam back at it the ant waved its long antennae and stanley switched his tail mundane mon sters made him uncomfortable they simply werent natural the next cage was labeled mamoths inside were the biggest night butterflies ivy had ever seen with furry antennae and folded dark wings they carried no butter however they seemed to be asleep though it was day another cage contained an enormouse crunching up a huge chunk of cheese others had tremendoes which were large splithoofed animals vaguely like the yak eating leaves gigantics sucking on a big bloodroot stupen does even larger than the other does and immens which were ogresized men ivy paused at the last exhibit it didnt seem right to her for any type of men to be imprisoned like this her mind was small so her thoughts translated to action very quickly stan ley lets let these creatures go she said dragon on a pedestal the dragon was willing he jetted so fierce a shot of steam at the leafy lock in the immens cage that it melted and the gate swung open the mens crowded out pleased with their new freedom ivy and stanley went back along the cages melting each lock having found out how easy it was to free the exhibits soon all the confined creatures were free charging about madly there was such pandemonium that ivy and stanley were daunted they retreated to the very edge of the coventree climbing the retaining wall this wall intersected the wall of an adjacent tree where things were less hectic so they jumped across leaving the confusion behind this new tree was very pretty welcome to pagean tree its leafsign said and of course they ignored it they were too interested in all the pretty colors of the foliage much brighter than the leaves of the last tree and in the remarkable forms this new foliage assumed there were also marching bands each band a strip of cloth or cord or rubber with little legs that tramped along at a meas ured pace somewhat the way the tough babies of the infant tree had marched ivy was entranced and stanley became interested too since she thought he would be but after a while even the splendors of the pageantree palled for life was more than pageans and they jumped to the foliage of still another tree this was its sign said a date palm its fronds representing all the days of the year day lilies grew in little cups of earth but only one bloomed each day so that the precise date was always marked in the very center grew a large century plant its thick long green leaves spreading out in a globe spiked along the sides and tips in the middle of the century plant was something really fascinating it seemed to be another plant with straight stalks clothed by many small round bright leaves that glittered in the sunlight like golden coins ooooh pretty ivy exclaimed i want one little girls resembled big cranes in this respect they liked pretty things she tried to get in to the coin plant but the spurs of the century plant prevented her the spurs were very sturdy so she could not simply push them aside stanley helped steaming dragon on a pedestal each spur so that it turned soft which enabled ivy to pass but progress was slow for there were many spurs stanley had to stay right with her because as soon as the two of them passed the spurs became hard again stanley tried to chew off a leaf but its juices were like those of a zombie and he quickly desisted before he got sick so they wriggled and scrambled their way through the many thick leaves with stanley expending much steam until at last they arrived at the bright plant in the very center ivy reached for a coin a smile of innocent delight on her face but the moment her little fingers touched the golden leaf there was a flare of light from the plant that bathed both girl and dragon making the entire scene glow eerily it was a glow ivys mother had seen in a vision but had not quite understood for it was only an incidental part of the vision the two of them froze exactly as they were becoming living statues unmoving unbreathing they had been caught by one of the least dramatic but most powerful plants in xanth the one that ultimately governed and brought down almost every other living creature thyme chapter xanthippe i he storm had cleared by morning but it had had its revenge on irene by wiping out all conceivable tracks and traces and so battering the vegetation that it could not remember the events of the day before the trail was now thoroughly cold and wet in addition the sun was laggard about penetrating the cloud cover so irene couldnt dry her clothing properly she grew dragon on a pedestal new bloomers and slippers and from dry towels fashioned a skirt and jacket cut and buttoned appropriately she wasnt entirely comfortable but she set out bravely enough making grundy query every plant in the region just in case none of them remembered ivy i hesitate to suggest this chem began but then dont suggest it irene snapped she knew what the centaur was going to saythat something had captured ivy and taken her away so that the little girl might never be found but the ivy plant remained green signaling the childs health and irene would not rest until she rescued her they searched for hours at one point a griffin spied the party and swooped down for a closer look griffins were among the most feared creatures of the wilderness as they possessed the bodies of lions and the wings of eagles and were always hungry and ferocious but irene gave this one no shrift she hurled down a boxwood seed and ordered it to grow the plant grew into a small tree with many hard wooden gnarls it moved these gnarls about boxing at the griffin the boxwood was aggressive it liked physical contact only a few of these attacks were necessary before the animal fled finally grundy got a lead this anchor plant saw her its very hard to dislodge so the rain couldnt wash out its memory but but what irene cried dashing over but she had a companion the golem said reluctantly not the yak but shes all right irene said as if daring the golem to deny it yes but the creature she met it didnt attack her irene said with the same defiance her ivy plant remained vigorous reassuring her not exactly perhaps had better question him chem offered but irene would have none of the centaurs levelheadedness an uncomfortable night physically and emotionally had short ened her fuse and she had never been especially noted for her patience out with it knothead what creature it sounds like the gap dragon dragon on a pedestal now irene reacted she had been braced for anything any thing but this she fell back against chem almost collapsing the centaur grabbed her to support her thegap reduced grundy said quickly remember you told us it got doused with youth elixir and youthened into babyhood just like humfrey but the ggap dragon irene protested the most vicious monster in xanth no matter what size it is now yes the same irene nerved herself what happened grundy queried the anchor plant they seem to have made friends he reported doubtfully they walked away together the gap dragon has no friends irene said perversely arguing with him its a loner it eats everything it catches that cant be entirely true chem said unless the dragon is immortal it must have had parents and it will have to breed to reproduce itself so there must be a place in its scheme for companionship and now it has been rejuvenated it could indeed be immortal if it uses the fountain of youth regularly but i doubt that is the case regardless it could be lonely as a child in that situation would be some child grundy exclaimed children do differ from adults the centaur insisted they are more impressionable more open more likely the dragon just didnt happen to be hungry at the moment so it saved her for the next meal grundy sug gested helpfully chem aimed a forehoof at the golem but missed irene just beginning to believe that her child might possibly be all right suffered a renewed pang the gap dragon was a scheming canny creature smarter than the average dragon we had better catch up to them soon she said grimly they traced the youngsters to an infanttree several of the tough babies remembered the pair sure we chased em grundy translated the beast really steamed us we dont take that shift from anyone but where did they go irene demanded whats it to you old dame another baby asked hanging loose as the golem translated dragon on a pedestal just answer the question you little swinger irene said sternly the baby paused in its swinging they fled beyond the witchs tree it said by the time we made a forcedmarch there the trail was cold weve got better things to do than hunt for dummies one of those dummies was my daughter irene exclaimed angrily tough shift sister the infant retorted ill toughshift you you fat brat irene cried she threw down a seed grow the seed sprouted into a cowslip plant in moments it was depositing slippery and smelly cowchips all around next time the infants marched they would find themselves slipping in truly shiftless stuff that wasnt nice irene grundy said smugly he appre ciated dirt no matter who flung it just tend to your business golem or ill grow a wart plant on your head grundy shut up and tended to his business but the trail was indeed cold the witchs tree was distracted by an infestation of large bugs or wild animals in its foliage and wouldnt answer grundys query apparently the bugs had been confined and recently released for they were raising havoc in the upper foliage the grass below the tree was washed out so the party simply had to go on casting about as before hoping to find a plant or tree that remembered a child and a little dragon they got beyond the region where it had rained but still there was no clue irene was too stubborn to admit they had lost the trail entirely and were probably going in the wrong direction her daughter had to be out here somewhere they came to a bleak area yellowish overall where normal trees gave way to strange thicktrunked growths from which grew long thin grasslike leaves with upright spikes at the top bearing whitish flowers grundy queried one and discovered it was a grasstree named xanthorrhoed now this is interesting chem said centaurs were chron ically fascinated by unusual fauna and flora xanthorrhoed is dragon on a pedestal one of the really primitive fundamental plants of xanth as can be told from its name xanthhomd irene asked i dont have any seed for that perhaps you should add some to your collection i believe this type of plant is associated with witches a new voice said irene looked around to see a sallow yellow old woman distracted by the grasstree she had not seen the woman approach what are you creatures doing in my garden im looking for a child irene said shortly have you seen her three years old perhaps accompanied by a small dragon ah so the witch said i just may have news of those they belong to you my daughter irene said where is she i must reach her before the witch looked irene in the face the witch was an ugly old crone hunched and dirty with a wart on her nose go to my hut yonder enter the cage there and lock yourself in she said irene tried to resist this ridiculous directive but found her self compelled the witchs talent was instant hypnotism or something stronger irene had to obey she walked to the hut entered it and found the cage inside she got into it and drew the door closed hearing the click of its lock now that she had done the witchs bidding irene found the compulsion relieved she was in control of herself again but she was locked in and the wooden bars of the cage were too strong for her to break she had a knife but knew it would take a long time to saw through one of these bars well she could cope with that she dropped a seed on the floor grow the seed sprouted brightly it was a fire fern in moments it had set fire to the cage and was burning through several bars while she waited hunched in the comer farthest from the blaze irene kept busy she grew an octopus plant which she knew would do her bidding when the witch entered the hut dragon on a pedestal she would become captive herself as an added precaution irene sprouted a club moss so she could arm herself better a few minutes later the witch entered the hut the octopus wrapped its tentacles about her and irene menaced her with a club now you illicit creature i want to know irene began the witch looked her calmly in the eye put down the club tell your creature to release me oh fudge irene swore i forgot about the hypnostare but she put down her club then directed the octopus plant to release the witch she had some limited powers over the plants she grew though she still had to be careful with the most aggressive ones a tangle tree for example did not take many orders from anyone she resolved to turn her back to the witch as soon as the compulsion left her so that she could not be hypnotized again but before that happened the witch did hypnotize her again sit down woman listen to what i say irene sat down on a rickety wooden chair and listened seething she had made such an obvious mistake letting the witch look her in the eye a second time i shall introduce myself the witch said i am xanthippe the wicked witch of the wilderness i associate with the xan thorrhoed trees the root plants of xanth as their name sug gests you have intruded on my property and you are in my power i see you are a sorceress yourself and that pleases me more than you may presently appreciate but you remain subject to my will because have your daughter irene could not speak since she had been ordered to listen but the news electrified her and she strained forward atten tively she and the little dragon are captives of my thyme plant the witch continued they intruded on my premises as you did and indulged in much mischief before they were restrained they loosed my collection of gargantuons there are tuons rampaging all over my coventree where i keep my most val uable exhibits so they had to be punished they will remain enchanted forever until i decide to free them or at least a century whichever comes first she eyed irene speculatively dragon on a pedestal oh to be sure with your clever control of plants you could free them toobut only i know where my thyme plant is hidden and what menaces are guarding it i can have your child destroyed before you can rescue her you must have my co operation if you wish to save herand you shall have that only at my price now irene could speak you have the nerve to hold my daughter hostage do you know who i am no the witch said who are you irene suddenly realized that this old crone could be much worse to handle if she learned she had the queen of xanth in her power better to leave her in ignorance irene found that the old hags power could compel her actions but not her words except when words were actions as in directing her plants to grow or let someone goso she didnt have to say more than she chose i amirene what do i have to do to get my child back the witch studied her appraisingly again thats the proper attitude you strike me as a fine healthy young woman with good magical power and some practical skills such as making your own clothing from towels you should make an excellent mate for my son and your talent with plants would assist my own collections irene was aghast a mm she couldnt get the word out but im married i have a child thats why im out here looking for her yes i want a woman who can breed i want my son to settle down to be a family man to be under the influence of acompetent woman and a proven breeder youll do i will not do irene flared you may be able to make me do something for five minutes but you could never get me to stay with a man i dont love there is much a knowledgeable woman can do with a man in five minutes with or without love xanthippe remarked i can see that you do that and do it again on another day as many times as are necessaryand once you carry my sons child you may not be quite so eager to leave him irene was shocked again at the witchs directness and un scrupulousness this is impossible dragon on a pedestal assure you it is possible how do you think i got my son how else indeed even when young xanthippe must have been too ugly to attract a man but her magic made attraction unnecessary the man would perform at her behest irene tried again i mean my husband would what would he do after he learned you carried another mans child the witch inquired irene didnt like to contemplate that so she didnt you cant be serious the moment you arent watching me ill destroy you and what then will happen to your daughter who remains in my power the witch asked you may have her back only after a sibling is on the way a sibling irene found it hard even to grasp the enormity of the witchs design ill never you were unable to locate your daughter before can you do so now irene was silent she couldnt stand the thought of putting ivy into any unnecessary jeopardy she couldnt risk wiping out the witch until she had gotten ivy out of danger i will introduce you to my son xavier xanthippe said perhaps you will like him though that really doesnt matter it would simply make it easier for you come this way numbly irene followed the witch she had no further thought of harming xanthippe directly ivy was hostage the witch was in control for now xanthippe led the way to an orange tree the trunk and all the leaves were orange making it distinctive chem centaur was tethered to it by an iron chain fastened to a hind foot and grundy golem was locked in a small mesh cage the witch had captured the whole party except for the zombie wait here xanthippe said i will bring my son to you and irene had to obey go soak your warty snoot hag grundy called from the cage the witch ignored him and walked on to a dilapidated yellow barn she hypnotized you irene asked chem dragon on a pedestal the centaur nodded grimly i closed the cuff on my own leg she admitted i couldnt oppose her though i desperately wanted to and grundy climbed into the cage himself she just looked each of us in the eye i know too bad the gorgon wasnt traveling with us grundy doubled over with laughter though irenes remark had been serious she could have had the gorgon in the party had she but known but their time for any exchange of information was limited what happened to zora zombie irene asked the witchs power didnt work on her chem said i think the zombie doesnt have enough of an eye or mind to be hypnotized she wandered off theres nothing she can do anyway i suppose not irene said testing the chain that held the centaur it was far too strong for her to break herself but she knew she could do the job with the right plant quick grow something and spring us grundy exclaimed before the old dame gets back she told you to wait here but she didnt tell you not to help us true as far as it went i cant irene said sadly shes holding ivy hostage oops that is trouble chem agreed what does she want from us before irene could answer the witch returned behind her was a hippogryph carrying a young man evidently the witchs son the remarkable thing about both man and animal was their matching color both were golden yellow the hippogryph had the forepart of a griffin with a great golden birdofprey head and splendid yellowfeathered wings now folded back along his body the rest of him was equine with powerful horse muscles and flashing yellow tail the man too was yellow at least in his clothing with vibrant blond hair and beard and a tan that almost glowed like polished gold he was actually quite handsome what a creature chem breathed with reluctant admira tion irene wasnt sure which creature the centaur meant but suspected it was the equine one drogon on a pedestal the party arrived get down xavier xanthippe said i want you to meet a woman aw maw the man said xap and i were just going flying you ungrateful yellowbellied wretch the witch screamed showing instant ire that startled irene because of its contrast to her prior manner get down from there xavier the dutiful son grimaced and dismounted he seemed to be in his early twenties and his bronzed muscles bulged irene was privately amazed that a woman as ugly as xanthippe could have a son as robust as xavier it must have been some man she compelled to sire her child but why not she could afford the best the witch evidently had excellent taste in hu man flesh that thought almost made irene blush for the witch had chosen her tonever mind see this woman xanthippe said to her son indicating irene do you like her xavier hardly glanced at irene oh sure maw he agreed shed be real pretty if she got out of them towels now can i go flying not yet son notice the body on her good legs good front nice face a sweet one to hold sure maw shes great if you like that type now can i shut up you imbecile the witch screamed at him and the powerful youth was cowed what a sharp tongue you have granny grundy called from his cage i can make her take off the towels so you can see xanthippe continued in her reasonable tone naw thats too much trouble maw me an xap was just going out i think she would make a good wife for you the witch told her son firmly aw maw dont want a wife i just want to fly xavier turned again to his steed ready to mount irene didnt know whether to feel relieved at the youths evident disinterest or affronted she wasnt that far over the hill dragon on a pedestal freeze you peabrained creep xanthippe shrieked and he froze you will marry this woman whatshername irene you old hen grundy called helpfully quiet you peabrained creep irene snapped at him in a semiperfect fury this woman irene the witch concluded shes a good match for you shes a plant sorceress shes got spirit and she can breed aw maw i dont know anything about you dont need to know this woman has had experience ill just give her an order and she will take it from there you will find it very easy even pleasant to do what is necessary after that you can go fly aside from the horror of her situation irene found a moment to marvel at the naivete of the young man was he really that ignorant of the facts of life then she remembered that dor had been almost as innocent at first men seldom knew as much about life as they thought they did perhaps xavier merely had a better notion of his ignorance than some did aw maw i want to fly now he protested cant it wait for a rainy day or something a rainy day irene bit her tongue it would be just her luck that the fractious cloud would spot her again and make that day come true the witch perceived a problem obviously she didnt want to be too harsh with her handsome son or to introduce him to the facts of life too abruptly irene noticed that xanthippe did not use her power on xavier but employed persuasion instead she did seem to care about him and genuinely wanted what she thought was best for him that hardly excused her complete callousness about other people but did show that she wasnt all bad irene would have had more sympathy if her own welfare were not in peril xanthippe tried another kind of coercion your steed needs a good mate too ill breed him to this filly centaur whats hername chem old trot grundy filled in shut up you imbecile chem snapped swishing her tail fiercely draon on a pedestal this filly chem the witch finished shes young but centaurs are smart animals shell produce a fine foal maybe it will have the brains of a human and the wings of a gryph wouldnt you like that the hippogryph no dummy backed away nervously and half spread his splendid wings he didnt want to be bred to a centaur aw maw xavier said now youve scared xap he dont want any foal cant we go flying instead no you cant nitwit the witch shrieked im going to breed you both to these fine females i want to be a grandmother before i kick off now lets get on with it irene shocked by the whole business had been silent now she realized that she might after all have a common cause with the witchs son xanthippe xavier doesnt want to marry especially not an old married woman like me you cant force your son into a commitment like this and hope to keep his love hell do what i say the witch snapped maybe so but you will inevitably alienate him and the moment you pass away hell do what he wants cant you see its no good he doesnt want me and i dont want him these things never work out unless theyre voluntary love is one thing you cant compel with your stare you really have nothing to gain and considerable to lose oh dont know grundy said a smart spirited golden grandchild who can breed chem closest to him stomped the top of the golems cage with a forehoof the sound was like a minor crack of thunder the golem took the hint and shut up confound it cant wait for him to get around to it the witch complained all he wants to do is fly a wife and family will make him grow up and settle down irene had to agree with that analysis her husband dor had settled down considerably after their marriage and that made him a better king but the witch had decided on the wrong matchup aw maw i dont want to quiet you moronic child xanthippe shrieked dragon on a pedestal thats telling him crone grundy called irene cast about desperately for a way out of this the witch might be wrongheaded but the witch had the power maybe i could do something else for you she suggested i could grow you a nice tree even an orchard with plants that would otherwise take years to mature ive got trees galore the witch said your brat messed up my coventree exhibits something awful ill try to get them back for you irene said no i was about ready to get some new exhibits anyway but i planned to do it in an orderly fashion you have nothing i want except your body for my son then ill fetch him a nymph nymphs dont breed theyre playmates not reproducers hes already had more than enough play time there seemed to be some justice in that statement irene cudgeled her brain for some other notion that might appeal to the singleminded witch but nothing offered there must be something chem said her fate was on the line too witches always need strange things for their collections the only other thing i want you could not get the witch said shortly but as mates for my son and his steed you are as it were birds in the hand try us chem said we might surprise you yeah try them battleaxe grundy agreed quiet you runty rag snippet the witch told him i am just about to try them xavier come stand before this woman so i can give her the order i meant the alternative service chem cried nice choice of terms maremane grundy remarked what is the one other thing you want irene cried picking up on chems lead aw maw dont want nothing else xavier began quiet you moron irene snapped at him xanthippe considered very well i will mention the other matter so that you can see it is useless to consider all my long and angry life i have wanted three seeds from the tree of seeds dragon on a pedestal seeds irene exclaimed i know about seeds the witch paused reappraising her why so you do you do have a way with plants however these are not ordinary seeds and seriously doubt what is this tree of seeds chem asked more cautious about an unknown commitment than irene was i dont believe i have information on it irene realized that it had to be an extremely rare tree for centaurs were well educated with a great bent for taxonomy and chem specialized in geography indeed she had mapped most ofxanth as part of her course of centaur research because of her the onceunknown regions of the elements in northern xanth were now known she would be aware of the most significant things in xanth its on mount parnassus hidden in the illiterate wilder ness the witch explained only my sons hippogryph knows how to reach it from here and the tree is guarded by the simurgh the simurgh chem explained thats the wisest bird alive it has seen the destruction of the universe three times and has all the knowledge of the ages i didnt realize it re mained in xanth thought it had departed centuries ago how id love to interview it even for an hour which relates to the rest of my desire xanthippe said what id like is a feather from its tail those feathers have magical properties and can cure wounds but the way to mount parnassus is so dangerous this tree of seeds irene said what kind of seeds does it have all the seeds produced by all the wild plants that exist the witch said her wicked old eyes turning dreamy for a mo ment the seed from which my own coventree sprouted came from there centuries ago likewise the pageantree geome tree infanttree industree and psychiatree i would very much like to see that psychiatree chem murmured i suspect that would be a mindaffecting experi ence there are seeds on the tree of seeds that no longer exist dragon on a pedestal anywhere else the witch concluded seeds no ordinary per son can even imagine im sure a centaur could imagine them chem said such as the exseed the proseed and the interseed xanthippe said all the seeds that exist irene breathed how id like to see that tree you cant reach it the witch asserted parnassus is guarded by the python who consumes anyone who sets foot there no one of any intelligence has ventured near parnassus in decades but we arent that smart grundy said we might ven ture for once the bigmouthed golem was correct suppose we make you a deal irene said well fetch your three seeds and one feather and youll return my child and let us go xanthippe shook her head its too much of a gamble you might never return but of course ill return for my child irene exclaimed not if you die on the way oh there was that indeed yet if the alternative was to be involuntarily mated to the witchs son well do it irene decided well fetch your feather and seeds if we dont return you lose but if we do return you will have the items you have always wanted that you can get in no other way double or nothing bag grundy put in im not sure xanthippe said wavering just tell us how to reach parnassus i cant tell you the witch said only the hippogryph knows the way and only my son can control that beast irene perceived another reason xanthippe was halfway care ful about the feelings of her son xavier did have some lev erage xap would be dangerous indeed were he not under control so xav and xap come along frump grundy said no problem there irene winced no problem the last thing she wanted was to associate closely with the witchs son and she doubted chem was any more sanguine about the hippogryph yet it seemed dragon on a pedestal to be the only feasible way to reach parnassus and parnassus seemed to be the only route clear of their present predicament so if she had to conquer parnassus to get her child safely back she would do it this time grundy is right irene agreed reluctantly they must come along what do you mean this time grundy cried quiet you nitwit chem snapped poising her forehoof above his cage xavier and xap can lead the way and well follow irene began then broke off for she saw the zombie zora was making her way toward them carrying something irene sighed inwardly she had forgotten about zora of course she couldnt neglect the zombie who had saved them from the monster of the night yet zora would only be a hindrance on this special quest the zombie shuffled up she held out the thing she carried showing it to irene it was a scale from a fish or reptile apparently broken off in the course of some quarrel or accident gaftsh she said blowing out some of her epiglottis this zombie is one of our party irene told the witch she was determined to do the right thing though she didnt enjoy it she will have to come too how will she travel xanthippe asked that hippogryph moves fast only the centaur will be able to keep the pace even if xap keeps to the ground so shell ride the gryph old snot grundy said aw maw xap dont want to carry a living corpse xavier protested but the notion of actually getting the seeds had captured xanthippes imagination good enough the witch decided the gryph can handle one more bring me back my feather and seeds and ill free your brat from my thyme she touched the shackle on chems foot and it fell open freeing the centaur then she opened grundys cage similarly which three seeds do you want irene inquired as she and grundy mounted chem the seeds of doubt dissension and war the old witch said with gusto dragon on a pedestal doubt dis irene started shocked you cant possibly mean you do want your daughter back xanthippe inquired with a wrinkled smirk chem trotted across to lift zora up behind xavier neither man nor steed seemed enthusiastic about this companion but the witch glared them both quiescent irene hoped the zombie could ride well enough to stay on the hippogryph took off literally he spread his wings and launched into the air zora started to slide off but flung her rotten arms around xavier and kept her seatthough possibly part of that did fall off irene twitched an inward smile won dering how the golden young man was reacting to this embrace chem moved out trotting to follow below the hippogryph see you later old heifer grundy called back to xanthippe xap spiraled up at an angle his wings spreading hugely their beat so strong that the ascent was steep despite the con siderable mass of the animal and two riders the flight was magicassisted of course such a creature could never get off the ground in mundania chem had to break into a canter to stay in range thats one healthy animal she said obviously impressed irene had to agree the witch might be a shrill and ruthless hag and her son a muscular dunce but the hippogryph was a phenomenal specimen of its kind burdened by the weight of two people it nevertheless sailed up as if carrying no weight at all griffins were impressive but the hippogryph was more impressive because it had the body mass of a horse rather than that of a lion then xap got his bearings and glided southeast chem fol lowed varying her route to pick up decent running terrain did you catch the significance of zoras find she asked as she ran a dumb fish scale grundy demanded slightingly trust a creature whose brain is sludge to think thats worth anything a small bright dragon scale the centaur corrected him zoras brain must be fairly highquality sludge for she rec ognized what was important i am something of a scholar in the fauna of xanth so i know the different types of scales by dragon on a pedestal sight that variety is unique to the gap dragon but it is too small so it must be from the rejuvenated dragon who is with ivy irene exclaimed suddenly making the connection did zora find them she must have found evidence of their passage at least chem said thats why she brought the scale to you she was trying to say gap i was hoping the witch wouldnt catch on grundy clapped his tiny hand to his forehead so she was heard it and didnt notice if we fail in this quest and survive zora can still help us rescue ivy maybe irene said greatly relieved so it would seem chem agreed but lets do our best anyway we have made a commitment and ivys trail may not be easy to pick up even with that hintand really would like to meet the simurgh but those seeds doubt dissension war how could deliver that sort of mischief to a person like that think of the harm she might do with them dont have the answer the centaur admitted think we shall simply have to let events take their course irene nodded reluctant agreement she had consented to fetch the seeds for xanthippe and she always honored her agreements even when she regretted them her father king trent had taught her the importance of that chapter z hugo award ivy was a little sorceress though not yet recognized as such her magic talent was one of the select few that ex tended beyond the normal limits and had ramifications that would not have been credible anywhere except in xanth this was the gift of the demon x whose enormous magic permeated the land of xanth though the demon had no interest in the affairs of xanth at the behest of chems mother cherie centaur the demon had bequeathed to the descendants of bink and his wife chameleon the status of magicians thus their son dor was a magician destined from birth to become king of xanth and their granddaughter ivy was another similarly destined however the demon had not bothered to inform anyone of this allowing each person to find but in due course throughout the volatile history of xanth it had always been awkward to mess with magicians the hag xanthippe should have realized this but she was out of touch with events and did not know with whom she was messing she would surely pay a price ivy had been trapped by the thyme and held helpless by its timelessness there were only three ways to escape this trap to suffer a general holocaust that destroyed the entire region to be freed by the witch or to wait for the century plant to bloom the holocaust was not advisable for it would destroy ivy and stanley ong with the thyme and much of the rest of xanth and part of mundania too as for the witch she was not about to free the child before obtaining one feather and three potent seeds so that wasnt a worthwhile prospect either dragon on a pedestal because the chances of her obtaining those artifacts were small and the century plant still had ninetythree years to go before it bloomed but ivy was a sorceress which was a sexist definition of a female magician her power was her ability to intensify the qualities of things about her thus though she was ensorcelled by the thyme she also acted upon it in her curious fashion the timelessness of thyme became concentrated to an extraor dinary degreeand this affected the century plant in which it rested the century plant thought it was aging at the rate of fiftytwo weeks per year give or take a day or so or failing that at twelve months per year but the intensification of time near the thyme warped and curved the environment in a manner that possibly only a brilliant mundane expert might theorize about and now the century plant was actually aging at the rate of one year per minute thus in just ninetythree minutes from the time ivy touched the thyme and fell into its power the thyme fell into her power the century plant completed its cycle and bloomed it shot up a central stalk which branched and flowered the stalk sprouted right under the thyme for that was the center of the plant the witch had put the thyme there because she knew it would not be disturbed for a hundred years by which time she would no longer be concerned with itand indeed it had been all right for the first seven years thyme was very important to a person as old as xanthippe now the flowerstalk ascended carrying the thyme up with it the stalk didnt bother with the entranced girl and dragon who were extraneous to its design thus in due course the contact between thyme girl and dragon was broken it was a small thyme plant and its range was limited this was perhaps fortunate for otherwise all of xanth and a smidgeon of mun dania would have experienced the acceleration of time and that would have been a complication of another nature when the contact ceased so did the spell of timelessness ivy and stanley woke together they did not yawn and stretch as they had not been asleep to them it seemed that no time had passed they had not aged even ninetythree min utes since the thyme did not affect all things identically es dragon on a pedestal pecially not sorceresses and their companions they didnt notice how the sun had jumped an hour and a half ahead in the sky for it happened to be behind a cloud at the moment hey ivy complained i was just going to get a pretty diskand it shot up out of reach that wasnt nice of it the dragon snorted steam agreeing he didnt like to see his friend distressed he tried to climb the flowerstalk in order to fetch the disk for her but the stalk was too narrow for him to get a proper grip and too tough for him to pull down oh never mind stanley ivy said disgruntled i didnt really want it anyway this was known as the sour grape ploy and it was adequate for the occasion im tired of these big trees lets go back down to the ground stanley happened to be a ground creature himself so was glad to oblige they made their way cautiously out of the century plant which was now larger than it had been though they hadnt seen it grow stanley steamed the spines soft as he had done before then they paused to eat some fruits finally they climbed down the big branches of the pageantree until they were able to poke their heads below the foliage and see the ground now there was a problem they were too far from the ground to jump down safely and the massive trunk of the tree was verticaltoo difficult for them to climb but ivy remained a reasonably smart child just about as smart as she thought she should be and she soon came up with a notion we must call for help someone always comes when a damsel calls for help someone always had come before at any rate a night in shiny armor think stanley wasnt sure about this but since his specialty was not rescues he let ivy handle it ivy took a deep small breath and screamed help in a moment something stirred below it was a person obviously coming to the rescue ivy was delighted she peered down favorably disposed toward her benefactor whoever or whatever he might be sure enough the night was a handsome young man with an intelligent face he seemed to have left his shining armor behind but perhaps it had been too hot for this warm weather that didnt matter she fell instantly dragon on a pedestal in love with him for this was what rescued damsels in the company of dragons did now it was time for introductions these things had to be done according to protocol hello nightoutofarmor whats your name she called the rescuer looked up hugo he said after a pause for reflection im ivy this is stanley hes a dragon she said com pleting the formula help get us down handsome hugo pondered again the truth was he had never been considered a bright boy and certainly not a handsome one so he wasnt certain what this meant he looked down at his clothes which were dirty and ragged but somehow they didnt seem as disreputable as expected what he didnt realize was that ivys talent was working on him already she considered anyone whocame to rescue her to be a model of intellect and appearance and courage by definition so he was assuming these attributes like them or not indeed his dull wit was brightening and beginning to func tion as never before he needed to help them get down what was the best strategy a light bulb appeared above his head shining its light all about before fading out something to fall on he said something soft like a pile of squishy fruit but ivy wasnt quite sure about that i dont like squishy fruit her mother had fed her that when she was a baby not long ago and ivy had made a horrendous face spat it out and disliked it instantly and permanently exactly as any sensible person would oh hugo considered again he didnt really like squishy fruit either unfortunately that was all he was able to conjure he looked around he was in luck a bed bug he exclaimed spying one sleeping nearby ivy remembered that the friendly yak had said there were bed bugs in this neighborhood oh goody hugo hurried over gripped the bug by the headboard and hauled it across to the pageantree the bug dragged its four little rollerfeet but was otherwise passive it really wasnt con dragon on a pedestal structed for exercise this was a good one it had excellent springs and fat pillows ivy approved she dropped down and bounced on the mat tress with a little squeal of joy there was hardly a more enjoyable pursuit for a child than bouncing on a really soft and springy bed though the monster under the bed complained about the noise and vibration but this bed didnt have a mon ster so it was all right she bounced a few times then got off so the dragon could come down too he did following her lead but stanley had never bounced on a bed before and wasnt as good at it as ivy was he flipped tailoversnout and missed the mattress on the rebound but that fall was from a lesser height and he was a tough breed of creature so he wasnt hurt one scale did get knocked off though well he would grow a new one in due course that spot would be tender for a while but a dragon learned to cope with such discomfort hugo gazed upon the dragon with a certain dismay he had spent a day and a night hiding from monsters and this was certainly a monster albeit a small one he was sure he had seen it before the dragon for his pan did not really appreciate the ap pearance of a human being he had had ivy all to himself until now obviously she liked this boy and that meant hugo was a rival for her attention once stanley had come to accept ivys attention he didnt want to share it so he growled turned a deeper shade of green and heated up some steam one never could tell when a good head of steam might be useful hugo in turn got ready to summon some really squishy fruit the one thing that was good for was throwing it at mon sters dripping pineapple was especially nice fortunately in the way of women of any age ivy realized there was a problem she acted with instinctive finesse to alleviate it dont quarrel she cried you two must get along together for you are both my friends hugo is my boy friend at this hugo was freshly startled and stanley is my dragon friend so youre friends to each other too neither boy nor dragon was quite certain of the logicbut this too was typical of such situations ivy wanted it that way dragon on a pedestal and she perceived them to be friends so that aspect of their psychology was enhanced and they were friends it would not be fair to say it was a completely tranquil friendship but it would do sorcery as always was a marvelous thing now we must go home ivy decided where are your folks hugo she had never been to humfreys castle and indeed did not know hugo was the son of the famous magician of xanth hugo considered my fathers a big baby and my mothers face turns people to stone he announced mine too ivy agreed especially when ive been bad wheres your home hugo pondered again he wasnt used to being as smart as this so it took some reorientation he did have a fair sense of direction when he thought to use it that way he said pointing roughly northeast okay well go that way ivy faced northeast getting it set in her mind she had not thought to ask how far it was it did not occur to any of them that they would have been better off proceeding west to castle zombie ivy started marching and so stanley and hugo marched with her they entered a deep dark section of forest where the sun light did not penetrate and the wind was chill ivy felt nervous since she did not like dark cold places but she forged on the others forged with her they soon tired for they were all young and rested on a sodden log in the gloom im hungry ivy said how can we get food she believed she didnt need to be smart now because of course hugo was smart and he could do the think ing he was after all the night in shiny armor well i can conjure some fresh fruit hugo said but oh goody i like fresh fruit that was quite different from the squished fruit she hated but it isnt very good ivy refused to believe this i just know anything you do is good hugo because youre such a handsome wonderful tal dragon on a pedestal ented person youll bring perfect fruit not that squishy stuff grownups use to punish babies with she did have a point but hugo had less confidence in his ability than she did you wont like it he warned and con jured an apple the apple appeared in his hand it was a fine large red fresh firm fruit and looked absolutely delicious hugo gazed at it with amazement all his prior apples had been more like applesauce enclosed in wrinkled bags formed of peel what had gone wrong goody ivy exclaimed accepting it while hugo stood frozen she opened her little mouth and took a big bite the apple crunched wholesomely scrumptious she pronounced around her mouthful bring some more hugo shook his head as if clearing it of dottle disbeliev ingly he conjured a banana it appeared in his hand big and firm and yellow he made a motion to peel it but his belief failed so he offered it to the dragon instead stanley had only learned to like fresh fruit since encoun tering ivy and this was the first banana he had met he set it on the ground and steamed it the fruit cooked and split open smelling delicious the dragon decided he liked it and he slurped it up complete the skin wasnt as chewy as bone but would do hugo conjured a plum taking courage it seemed as good as the other fruit he nerved himself and took a small bite the fruit was juicy and tasty i cant understand it he said usually my fruit is as rotten as a zombie zombies are fun ivy said they know all kinds of games like hideinthegrave and yuchinthebox hugo hadnt thought of it quite that way before but realized it was true youre a good conjurer ivy continued confidently and of course in her presence he was his talent had been enhanced into competence after that reveling in his newfound power hugo conjured fruit freely so that all of them could feast he produced a whole pile of beefsteak tomatoes for the dragon as stanley dragon on a pedestal preferred meat when he could get it for the first time in his life hugo felt competent they resumed their travel more slowly now because of darker and more scary terrain and their tiring legs none of them had ever realized just how big xanth was always before they had been carried from place to place on carpets or on centaurs so that long distances seemed short walking was a different matter but they were confident they would arrive where they were going if they just kept at it ivys mind wandered as there certainly wasnt much for it to do around here she thought of her nice room in castle roogna with the magic tapestry that showed scenes of the fabulous history of xanth she thought of the nice cherry trees of the castle orchard with the exploding red fruits she thought of the friendly ghosts of the castle she did not think of millie as a ghost for millie had returned to life long before ivy was born but funloving jordan was still there jordan had helped save xanth from the nextwave she had been told so he was now in excellent repute and was sometimes allowed to baby sit her when her folks were out it was amazing how much more interesting home became when she was far away from it ivy paused in her thoughts was that the ghostcentaur she had glimpsed maybe not since there was no sign of it now but hugo paused too heyimbris here he exclaimed who the day mare she brings me daydreams all the time back home is she a centaur no shes a horse of course a mythical animal with the front end of a sea horse and the hind end of a centaur she used to be a night mare and would carry bad dreams to sleepers but now she is a day mare and she brings good daydreams i like her because she visits me a lot when im lonely and she never says anything bad to meto clean up my room or wash behind my ears but i didnt think she could find me out here in the jungle oh i guess it was me she found can we ride her no dummy shes a phantom horse dragon on a pedestal ivy had not heard the term dummy before as it was not used in her home and she took it to be an endearment because that was the kind of term nights in shiny armor used on rescued damsels she formed half a flush of pleasure can she tell our folks where we are my father maybe he can talk to mares when he uses a spell but hes a baby oh ivy didnt quite understand this figure of speech so she ignored it but i can talk to her a little because she brings me so many dreams sometimes i spend whole days alone in my room and imbri keeps me company shes a great companion can she show us the best way home i dont know her job is to bring dreams she gets sort of invisible any other time hugo concentrated no she says shes not allowed to show us where to go but she says be careful because theres something awful bad ahead something awful ivy asked worried oh i dont like awful things the dragon had another opinion he loved awful things he perked up his ears and fired up his steam thats rightstanley will protect us ivy said with happy revelation he can fight anything she patted the little drag ons hot scaly head and because she said it it almost seemed possible they went on sure enough something awful appeared at first ivy thought it was the monster under the bed but its hands werent big homy or callused so it couldnt be that it had multiple buglegs and wings and feelers and a huge horrible mask of a face a bugbear hugo cried appalled if this monster was related in any way to the other bug they had encountered the bed bug it certainly wasnt letting that show it wasnt large as monsters went but it didnt need to be for it specialized in snatching children especially naughty ones since naughtiness was part of the definition of childhood every child who ever existed was vulnerable the bugbear advanced on ivy who knew she was naughty dragon on a pedestal because she had gotten herself lost its bugeyes glared ma levolently at her and its bugmandibles gaped slobberingly ivy screamed and not merely because that was what a damsel in distress was supposed to do she wasnt really afraid of dragons they were distant adult creatures except for stan ley who was her friend but the bugbear was her size and it was close it knew exactly how to terrify her it grew larger and worser as it tromped toward her hugo conjured a ripe tomato and hurled it at the monster his aim was better than usual because ivy believed nights had good aim and the fruit splattered on the bugbears face this made the face only slightly less ugly than before still the thing advanced hairy bugarms reaching bug off hugo cried throwing an even riper tomato but the monster merely sloughed the squish from its nose and grabbed for ivy now stanley acted he aimed his snout pumped up his pressure until his safety valve whistled and let fly a searing jet of superheated steam his steam had become much fiercer since he had started associating with ivy the steam struck the horrible maskface and ricocheted off but the heat and moisture were so intense that the bugbears face began to melt dripping different colors the thing re treated stanley pursued pumping up another burst of steam the bugbear turned tail and fled its tail was not fearsome at all such monsters had all their fear in front and became next to nothing when retreating indeed this one shrank visibly with each step it took and soon it vanished entirely oh stanley youre so wonderful ivy exclaimed hug ging his neck she polished up the pedestal which was higher and prettier now though still invisible the dragon discovered again that he liked getting hugged by a cute little girl and the pedestal was actually a pretty comfortable place to rest on his laurels he made a low purring growl it was fun saving damsels from bugeyed monsters hugo was not entirely satisfied however he felt that more attention was being lavished on stanley than the dragon war dragon on a pedestal ranted in fact he was a mite jealous which was odd because it was the dragon who was green they ate some more of hugos conjured fruit and proceeded with greater confidence they had met and conquered an en emy the jungle thinned as the land rose soon they were climbing a fairly hefty hill the dragon puffed naturally but now hugo and ivy were puffing too oh its hot ivy complained actually the air was normal temperature it was ivy who was heating then the air cooled as they came to a region of mist the wet air brushed by them coating them with moisture the dragon didnt mind for he was a steamer and drew on mist to replenish his water supply mist was rather like cold steam true steam like true water vapor was invisible so it could hide magically but water droplets tended to form from it giving its presence away had the mist been able to maintain its in visibility stanley would not have been able to tap it for his own purpose but the two children did not appreciate this ad vantage and were uncomfortable oh lets rest ivy said my legs are like noodles in deed they seemed to bend under her forcing her to flop on the ground the others were glad enough to rest but they were not fated to rest long there was something in the mist behind them and it was not pleasant they couldnt see it or hear it yet they were aware of it stanley fired a jet of steam back in its direction but with no effect the problem with steam was that its range was limited if a thing was out of sight it was also out of reach then thunder rumbled increasing their nervousness ivy and stanley were not safely ensconced in the coventree this time they could get wet that bothered ivy more than it did stanley a bolt of lightning scorched into a rock nearby oh i dont like this at all ivy said jumping up they hurried away from the thunder and lightning going on up the hill this was just as well for the thunder continued to rumble behind punctuated by more shafts of lightning breathlessly they scrambled toward the top of the hill dragon on a pedestal at last they broke out of the top of the mist it was in fact a sunken cloud there were other clouds above but the inter vening layer was clear they looked around the top of the hill was like an island in the nether sea of cloud poking up through it as far as they could see in each direction there was the wavy white surface the effect was rather pretty in its fashion ivy was quick to appreciate prettiness wherever it occurred that was the way she had been raised do you think imbri will bring us a daydream of being carpetwrecked on this island and we cant leave it until the fog goes down so we have to stay here forever and just eat fruit ivy asked hugo shrugged i doubt it he said there was the merest flicker of something disappearing like a black horses tail the daydream had been canceled at the last moment and the mare had to depart but now a small gray cloud floated down from the upper layer it formed a malevolent face under its pointed crown the mouth opened and a small roll of thunder came out the day mare reappeared this time ivy could see her clearly she was a black equine hardly more than a shadow with flaring mane and tail it wants to know who on earth you are a centaur said in ivys mind surprised and confused by this development ivy didnot answer thats how imbri talks hugo explained she gives you a dream and the dream figure speaks imbri cant talk herself cause shes a horse but the dream figures can just answer it back ivy was glad hugo was so smart and knew all about such things the centaur no dummy the cloud imbris translating for it ivy blushed again with pleasure at the endearment this was all new to her but she decided it was all right it was nice of mare imbri to help out like this im ivy she said to the cloud who are you the mare must have projected a talking dream to the cloud dragon on a pedestal for it paused a moment then scowled darkly and blew out another piece of thunder ivy was a little frightened when it did that but tried not to show it because she wasnt sure stanley could make this thing go away he says youre supposed to recognize the king of clouds when you see him and perform abject obeisance the centaur dreamlet said ivy looked at the ground and dug a toe in the din trying to fathom what abject obeisance meant thats better the centaur said the cloud sees you are bowing andor curtseying he says he is his majesty cumulo fractonimbus the lord of the air he says you remind him of someone he doesnt likea female with green hair ivy realized that would be her mother irene she was about to ask where the cloud had seen her but hugo spoke first aw fractos just a bit of scud he said depreciatingly the cloud heard that and evidently needed no translation he swelled up and turned purplyblack lightning speared out of his majestys nose followed by a belch of thunder and a smattering of rainspittle hugo had to jump to avoid being scorched it seemed clouds were sensitive about name calling how dare you refer to the lord of the air as scud the dream centaur translated he wants you to know he hails from a long and foggy line of lofty meteorological effects from cirrus through stratus his relatives process the water that grows all the plants of xanth and fills all the lakes he advises you that without his kind the whole land would be a dust bowl and you would be ashes he is fracto the king a real thunderhead dunderhead hugo agreed with uncommon wit nights were noted for that the cloud turned so black he was almost a black hole he blew out such a blast of fog admixed with thunder that he nearly turned himself inside out oh now hugos done it the dream centaur said the king of clouds is very volatile and tempestheaded flee before he strikes but theres more thunder down there ivy protested look ing at the roiling layer of fog below dragon on a pedestal the fractoking shaped himself up enough to take good aim at hugo now he looked like a towering anvil but before he could hammer out a devastating thunderbolt stanley stepped forward and shot a fierce jet of steam into the spongy nether region this would have sent any ordinary monster sailing high with a youp of pain but the steam had little visible effect on the cloud clouds were composed of water as was the dragons steam the jet only added to fractos strength then ivy had a brightbulb notion hugo she cried con jure some fruit hugo conjured a watermelon and heaved it at the cloud cumulofractonimbus recoiled but then saw that this was only a fruit not a plant and surged back when the melon passed harmlessly through the cloud and splatted against the ground the moisture only added to the clouds strength no hugo ivy clarified a pineapple hugo caught on for nights were very quick to grasp battle strategies yes i can do it now he cried a huge firm potent pineapple appeared in his hand just before fracto spat out his next lightning bolt hugo heaved the fruit the pineapple disappeared into the mouth of the cloud just as the lightning bolt emerged the two collidedand the pine apple exploded the blast was phenomenal it blew the king apart fragments of fracto fog shot out in an expanding sphere jags of sundered lightning radiated out like a sunburst and thunder crashed into the ground bounced and lay quiet ooo you destroyed him ivy exclaimed nervously chew ing on a finger she wasnt accustomed to such violence you cant destroy a cloud that way the dream centaur said fracto is somewhat like a demon he will recoalesce worse than before in a few minutes flee ivy saw that it was so already the mean little scudclouds were globbing together forming larger fragments each with a single spike of fractos crown this was no safe place conjure some fresh cherry bombs ivy cried to hugo well beat a strategic retreat she almost surprised herself with that word strategic it had been beyond her comprehen sion before though she had heard her father use it when dis drogon on a pedestal cussing the ancient war of the nextwave which had happened two years before she was bom but now she was in a battle situation and the meaning of the term was manifesting clearly enough gotcha the boy agreed with the excellent grammar of the typical night a huge bunch of cherries appeared a double handful he flipped one cherry at the northeast side of the island and when the bomb exploded the layer of cloud there was disrupted it started closing in again immediately but obviously the fight had been temporarily knocked out of it hugo marched down clearing the way with a series of detonations whenever thunder threatened hugo threw a cherry at it and the effort dissipated explosively before long they emerged below the mist the cloud had suffered enough concussion it lifted high in the sky out of reach and floated away in a gray dudgeon ivy was thrilled by the victory you defeated fracto she exclaimed oh let me award you hugo she flung her arms about him and planted a fat kiss on his left ear in the way she had she might have had her terminology a trifle confused but the boy was quite satisfied with his award it was the first such thing he had ever earned he began almost to believe that he might be worthwhile stanley might have had a different opinion and his pedestal seemed somewhat cramped but he was so glad to get away from the clouds that he didnt bother to develop that opinion he dfd rather like the cherries they were his kind of fruit the pineapple too that had been a real blast they continued on through the valley but the jungle re mained thick with recognizable menaces like tangle trees and hanging vinesan unfortunate animal caught in one of the latter was not a pretty sightand unrecognizable ones like sections of ground that were suspiciously still the shadows were lengthening where they showed at all it was obvious the three of them needed a safe place to spend the night stanley sniffed the ground he had excellent reptilian per ceptions little drifts of steam puffed up between sniffs he picked up some kind of scent and followed it to the side ivy and hugo trailed after him t dragon on a pedestal the valley narrowed here becoming a kind of chasm sud denly the side of the chasm opened into a holea large cave in the fading light they could see that it was a fine dry place with warm air wafting from it it seemed to be the shelter they were looking for they entered found a convenient ledge and hauled in some fragrant brush to make a comfortable nest for the three of them hugo conjured several kinds of fruit and they feasted and tossed the seeds on the floor below then in the dark they settled down to sleep in what seemed like the middle of the night something huge and sweaty loomed in the entrance of the cave they couldnt see it but the ground shook with its tread and the air stank with its body odor and its great rasping breath stirred breezes near the top of the cave abruptly wide awake the three young travelers cowered in their nest aware that they had camped in the lair of a monster the very worst place the monster didnt spot them it had brought something in with it evidently a dead animal they heard the crunching of flesh and bones as the monster consumed the animal then the creature flopped down across the cave entrance and snored the sound was like the distant roaring of sphinxes with indi gestion they were trapped inside the monsters cave and the com ing of the light of dawn would expose them to the monsters view how were they going to get out of this picklement chapter tisi alee mg i hey traveled southeast into the depths of unknown xanth chem was delighted for it was her personal mission to map all of the peninsula she could find especially what had never before been recorded periodically she projected her magic map adding the new features and marking their progress with a neat black dotted line grundy true to his fashion irritated her by finding minor fault with the details your stupid linedots are covering up key features he said pointing to a section of the line theres a tiger lily squished under this dot he pointed to one of them serves it right chem retorted it snapped at my tail as i passed it irene looked up keeping track of the flying hippogryph she was half afraid the beast would disappear entirely but evidently xavier was taking his mothers directive seriously and was guiding them correctly it was obvious that the gryph could have flown much higher and faster than it was doing had it so chosen at least those two were getting their desire to go fly even if they did have to carry a zombie along hey thats nice grundy said reaching out to grab a small flower from a plant growing on a close bank dont touch it irene warned naturally the golem touched it anyway eeeek the flower shrieked piercingly wrenching itself away startled grundy looked back at the protesting flower what was that dragon on a pedestal i told you not to touch that touchmenot irene said com placently they are delicate plants and dont like to be han dled by clumsy oafs the golem started to say something then thought better of it they continued on through a field of creature plants gen erally harmless but sometimes startling duckweed quacked an alligator pear ground its teeth at themnaturally it had two jaws for the purpose an upper and a lower making the pair a windmill palm rotated its great bladeleaves causing wind to gust past them a pig lily oinked a pussyfoot crept away on little fogfeet fish grass swam away several toad plants croaked with great displays of mortal agony and a money plant waved green papery leaves at them then the air was filled with the frozen petals from a giant snowflake plant the petals settled in a maidenhair tree much to her annoyance she took a brush from a bottlebrush plant and brushed off the snow then plucked a powderpuff to restore her complexion chem distracted by the novel plants stumbled against a rock fortunately it was a shamrock so her hoof wasnt hurt a real rock would have been much worse a running myrtle spooked by the noise ran off a nearby punk tree laughed making the sound by cracking its wooden knuckles and creaking its limbs yeah grundy demanded always ready for an argument you aint so hot yourself punk a short distance away a pencil tree was making busy notes on a paper plant irene smiled apparently to these plants the sight of a centaur woman and golem was worthy of note the visitors were as strange to the plants as the plants were to the visitors but notes werent really necessary as there were several forgetmenot flowers around to remember near the edge of the field a spider lily was hot in pursuit of a butterfly flower while silver bells rang a warning that startled a zebra plant who was grazing on some unlucky clover chicken corn squawked as the zebra ran past and a curiosity plant craned its stem to see what was going on they must be getting closer to the tree of seeds irene reflected for all these unusual plants had to have sprouted from dragon on a pedestal seeds scattered from an unusual source the thought of that tree excited her she would try to fetch the witchs three bad seeds but she also hoped to garner some exotic specimens for herself all the seeds of the wilderness would be available as they reentered the deeper jungle grundy reached for a feather fem surely intending some ticklish mischief with it but a fan palm fanned it aside the golem slapped at the palm but it drew back closing its fingers about itself and all grundy struck was a section of a neighboring crownofthoms that plant dropped its thorny crown on the golems head what the golem said as he wrenched the prickly crown off was not comprehensible since it was in plant language but a bleeding heart vine blushed a trumpet lily sounded a retreat an artillery plant fired off a salute and a nevernever plant wilted they halted for a snack as traveling made them hungry xap and xavier came down company might not appeal to them but the food certainly did and they knew they could separate from the zombie when they landed at least for a while irene grew a custardapple plant a honey plant and a swiss cheese plant for xavier chem and herself a hot red pepper for xap and a genuine hasbean for grundy evening was nearing how much farther do we have to go irene asked xavier oh xap could be there in an hour the yellow man replied cheerfully but i guess youll need more time yes chem agreed succinctly it was evident she was tired from the long run through such varied terrain wings were definitely an asset for this sort of excursion so wed better make camp grundy said and move on to parnassus in the morning yes i think thats irene started then she froze ab solutely horrified there at the base of a barrel cactus lay the battered body of a child it looked like a girl and irene knew with a sick and awful certainty whom it had to be for the hair had a green tint her vision when they approached castle zombiehad it come true dragon on a pedestal she forced her frozen limbs to move and ran to the body and there was nothing just undisturbed forest floor whatever did you see chem asked solicitously i saw nothing out of the ordinary it must have beenmy mistake irene said faintly i sawivy she wasshe looked dead but your ivy plant remains healthy the centaur pointed out so whatever was there it could not have been your daughter yes of course irene agreed touching the ivy plant i should have realized but it had green hair oh thats the fetch xavier said dont pay that no mind miss the what irene asked dazedly the fetch its around our place all the time i told you it dont mean nothing chem switched her tail nervously im sure that is the case xavier but what exactly is the fetch an apparition naw its when you see a live person only you see him dead maw likes the fetch it suits her sense of humor it would grundy put in the person you see deadis really alive irene asked her horror abating it was not like her to be so destabilized by such a minor event but this vision had reinforced her prior vision reviving a deeper horror and that was hard to shake sure always xavier said it aint no fun for the fetch to show a real dead person fun chem exclaimed indignantly i dont like the fetch xavier confessed it used to be death to see it in the old days when xanth was new now its just bad luck maw likes bad luck but i dont irene glanced sidelong at the handsome young man liking him better despite his backwardness you dont get along with your mother oh i get along she tells me what to do and i do it so she dont use the eye on me but id rather fly irene could appreciate why any normal person would seek an excuse to spend time away from such a witch thank you dragon on a pedestal for the information about the fetch she told him its a great relief to me well youre a pretty gal real pretty even if maw does say so he said as if that related irene considered the ramifications of that minor comment before responding his mother the witch had wanted to match the two of them and both xavier and irene herself had resisted so he had complimented her despite the negative phrasing she rather liked at the age of twentyeight being called a pretty gal her days of girlhood were long past and some times she missed them she had been a showoff and a tease a dozen years ago and though it embarrassed her to remember it she had to admit it had been fun so if someone saw her as that sort now she was not really displeased even if he was an ignomant lout and she was a devoted wife to her distant husband and mother of a precious child so she behaved reck lessly and returned the favor and youre a handsome lad aw dont start on that mush stuff he said disgusted irene smiled privately xavier was truly a boy at heart the witch must really have sheltered him from life grundy chuckled though theoretically he had not been lis tening xavier grimaced maybe i better clear up a misunderstand ing he said i dont need no help from maw to figure out what to do with a nymph when it comes to that its just that something like marriage is too important to be done offhand edly i aim to make my own choice of womenand when i do itll be forever maw dont understand that maybe you do irene appraised him again he made a good deal more sense than she had thought him capable of yes perfectly she agreed i wish you well and the same goes for xap he knows his own mind he just hasnt found no femgryph he likes yet irene didnt comment she was satisfied to let it stand exactly at that it was not after all so bad traveling with this pair of males she grew a nice tree house and some cushion cactus for beddingthat kind had spines so soft they hardly even tick dragon on a pedestal ledand swept out the house with some broom she sprouted for the purpose xavier watched her at work with open ad miration you sure are good at that he exclaimed i should be irene murmured its my talent then to distract his interest which she judged to be getting possibly too personal she asked what is your talent xavier oh i zap things he said nonchalantly it aint nothing much xap your hippogryph not xap zap with a zsnore sound irene couldnt distinguish the distinction of pronunciation but concluded that one was the animal the other an action you zap things she repeated i dont ever do it to friends he clarified i dont like hurting folks but when im hunting or something or if a monster comes after me he shrugged that sounded like a weapon irenes interest increased they were deep in unexplored xanth and monsters could appear at any time xavier had evidently traveled through this region and had no fear of it so his zapping must be effective of course the hippogryph represented considerable protection for him so maybe his talent didnt matter could you demon strate i guess so he looked about see that cobra plant getting ready to strike the fillys leg irene looked startled sure enough the plant was rearing its flattened stem with two thomfangs glistening from its flower when a cobra plant spread such a cape the prudent person vacated the region quickly but chem was in dialogue with xap grundy translating chem wanted to determine a good mappable route to parnassus so that the mountain would no longer be unattainable she did not see the dangerous plant and irene was afraid to call out to her for fear that would trigger the strike it was a delicate situation i see it she murmured xavier pointed his right forefinger something shot out from it at about the speed of light possibly a little faster and zapped right through the lifted cobra head the plant hissed and ex pired bleeding poisonous sap why irene said astonished you can kill with that dragon on a pedestal oh sure anything any time but i dont like to hurt creatures i mean they got feelings and things same as i do so i just go fly with xap and i zap at the clouds it dont hurt them none you see and it sharpens my aim thats fun course theres this one cloud king fracto who dont like it he zaps back with lightning jags xap lost some tail feathers once well he dont have tail feathers but same place fractos always looking for a fight i think ive met him irene said remembering the cloud she had encountered on the way to the good magicians castle he has a bad attitude i dont mind zapping fracto but i wouldnt zap a bird or a person she trusted thats very good xavier she said carefully certainly you dont want to hurt any friendly creatures he looked at her more squarely gee you sure are pretty miss you got a shape on you like a nymph and he had told her he knew what to do with a nymph it seemed that though he resisted his mothers influence and was determined to make up his own mind that mind had not yet excluded irene from consideration she could not afford to have his interest fix on her in that manner even if he were more innocent than he claimed it was a fact that innocent youths did not necessarily remain so indefinitely im an old married woman looking for her child she said quickly oh sure youll get the kid back safe he agreed en couragingly too bad maw caught you the way she does everyone or youd probably have found the tot by now very likely true irene reflected ruefully the distractions of this quest to parnassus had blunted her concern somewhat for immediacies always came first but she knew she could never really rest until ivy was safe again what she had learned about xavier was important too before this conversation it had not occurred to her that this backwoods hick could be dangerous he was a powerful man his talent was deadly and his steed was one of the most for midable creatures of xanth if he had shared his mothers temperament or if for any reason he turned against irene she had a fine line to walk she could not afford to have dragon on a pedestal xavier become either too friendly or too unfriendly it would be best if he and xap flew elsewhere as soon as parnassus was reached chem turned about and came over carrying grundy xap says there is some bad terrain between us and parnassus she said he can fly over it but i can not so ive got to scout it out then ill be able to thread my way through it safely he says theres a knoll not far distant from which we can see the mountain a good place from which to map the intervening terrain if we go immediately we can reach the knoll before dark so if you dont mind irene you want us all to go irene asked dismayed i cant finish growing the tree house after dark no i can move much faster alone the centaur said but youre tired not any more you dont need me along do you grundy asked i want to rest yes naturally you will remain here chem said smiling obliquely i will not require translation on this foray good enough grundy said jumping down but are you sure you want toto go alone with such a creature irene asked worriedly again that oblique smile i am sure an amazing notion pushed at irenes consciousness as she glanced at the powerful birdhorse standing a short distance away xap was as fine a specimen of creature as she had seen in a long time all muscle and feather and gleam could chem want some private time with the hippogryph impossible and yet centaurs were crossbreeds and so were hippogryphs with a common heritage through their equine ancestry chem had found no suitable male centaur and xap had found no female of his kind could chem want a foal who could fly irene shifted her thoughts it was none of her business im sure we can get along here until you return we do need to find a good route to parnassus among other things she added silently excellent chem turned about and trotted back to xap dragon on a pedestal she did indeed seem to have lost her fatigue then the two shifted into a gallop and were quickly out of sight irene shook her head and i thought i understood cen taurs she exclaimed to herself it seemed the witchs notion of breeding had fallen on fertile soil after all xavier stared after the two well ill be jiggered shes grounded him i thought he didnt go for landbound fillies never underestimate the power of a filly irene murmured she remained astonished at this development but cautioned herself that it was mostly conjecture she could be misreading it all she wished chem well in whatever the centaur had in mind but was now doubly nervous about her own situation she was virtually alone with a man who could zap holes in creatures of course she could grow plants to protect herselfbut she didnt want to do that unless she was quite certain of the need the manner in which xavier had zapped the cobra plant un nerved her now that she thought about it she would not be able to handle him with mere pussywillows of course grundy was here and zora zombie but she really would have preferred chem however the centaur had her own affairs if that was not putting it too bluntly the tree house was almost complete it would have been done before now if ivy had been here irene knew her power was diminishing in the absence of her daughter the loss would not be critical but it was noticeable she had allowed enough time for the daylight had not yet faded she would plant some sword ferns around the base of the tree to prevent intrusion by nocturnal predators the fem would not grow any more by night but wouldnt need to any foot stepping on it would get slashed now there was the problem of leeping she hadnt thought of it before being concerned with her mission and the unusual social interactions this party was experiencing she had once supposed that the trip to parnassus could be completed in a few hours perhaps a day a foolish notion obviously so they had to camp along the way which was routine there was room for four in the tree house but when the four were a woman a golem a zombie and a strange man she could take precautions however she climbed into the dragon on a pedestal tree house and planted a monkeypuzzle tree she knew what its grown configuration would be so she would be able to crawl in and out of its cagelike puzzle readily while others would not she sprouted a few saw ferns at the entrance they would not saw at her but would at others and she would have a fairly secure fairly private chamber within the tree house without having to make an issue of it a lot could be done with plants when a person had the talent as well as a little foresight but oh she wished she were back with dor and ivy at castle roogna she worried how dor was getting along without her he really didnt have much of a head for governing few men did aside from her father that was why women were essential well that was hardly the only reason women were neces sary nonetheless men had their uses too irene jumped down from the tree house then lifted her head hearing a noise it sounded like the screeching of a wounded hydra xavier was listening too hey i dont like that he said could be a covy of harpies if it comes too close ill have to zap it now irene was glad about his talent for the sounds were raising hairs on her neck so far they had been fortunate and had not encountered anything bad that luck was evidently about to change its coming close grundy said irene youd better grow a plant quickly but darkness was closing rapidly inhibiting her power also until she knew the precise nature of the threat she could not select an appropriate seedand she feared by then it would be too late i think well have to depend on xavier she said reluctantly it wasnt that she doubted the young mans com petence or courage she just didnt like the notion of having to depend on any man other than her husband for anything the screeching came closer not harpies she decided but perhaps something related then in the gloom three shapes appearedhooded cloaked old women crying to one another in raucous whining illtempered tones if i didnt know better xavier murmured grimly id dragon on a pedestal swear that was my mother xanthippe but shes yellow and theres only one of her the last of the light showed their faces theyre real dogs grundy said he was speaking literally the faces of the three creatures were strongly canine with projecting snouts furry ears and bloodshot eyes on the sides of their heads long red tongues licked canine teeth between screeches as if moistening them for the next effort but that was not the oddest thing about these women their hair twisted in coils like the bodies of snakes their exposed arms and legs were so dark that they reflected almost no light at all and their cloaks turned out to be not cloth but huge batlike wings each female carried a kind of stick with several thongs dangling from it there you are you ungrateful urchins one of the creatures cried spying them we shall scourge your sins from you prepare to die in torment now wait irene said alarmed if only it were full day when her power was strongest she felt so defenseless who are you and why do you come bothering innocent travelers innocent travelers the canine crone screeched sounding worse than a harpy you girl who was such a trial to your lonely mother the sorceress for nigh thirty years and now ne glects her entirely what illusion can she spin to shield her own awareness from the serpents tooth of your ungratefulness with what solace shall she die away and alone while her daughter murders her with uncaring irene rocked back scourged indeed this was the last kind of attack she had expected and it was cruelly accurate she had been neglecting her aging mother how could this vile dog woman know dont talk to the lady like that you miserable spook xavier said angrily she asked you a question who the hades are you he lifted his finger ready to zap the crone and you you sniveling excuse for a son the second crone screeched advancing on him with her scourge raised when did you ever obey your mother the witch without forcing her to threaten to compel you with her eye a thing you knew she dragon on a pedestal did not want to do all these onescore years she labored to raise you rightwhat thanks did you ever give you careless and callous lout when she sacrificed her very pride to put another woman in your worthless life to cause you to marry and settle down and become a useful person what did you do how deep is her sorrow while you neglect all obligations of responsible life to go flying xavier stepped back in the way irene had his face frozen in shock and guilt his zapfinger stifled the hag had scored on him as readily as her sister crone had scored on irene how did they know so much but now grundy spoke up you talk pretty big you bundles of bags the golem cried but i know you you are the furies trying to blame everyone you meet for parricidefor killing his parents but you cant get me i know your namestis iphone alecto and megaera you are the daughters of mother earth as old as the world you call yourselves the kindly ones but its a lie youre the vicious ones youre creatures of vengeance and illconceived retribution but you cant blame me for neglecting my mother because i never had a mother i was made from sticks and cloth animated by magic and rendered to life by greater magic what do you say to that dogface so that was the story on these wretched harridans they were the fabled furies irene had thought xavier would be the one to defend the party but it turned out to be grundy with his knowledge of the nature of these women the third fury stepped forward threatening with her scourge golem do you think that because you were made not born you owe nothing to your creator what were your sticks and rags and string before the good magician animated you what thanks did you ever give him for that inestimable service of awareness did you not flee the moment you woke refusing to serve the purpose for which you were made did your neglect not cause him to lose several valuable days devising alternate means to converse with animals and plants so he could complete his project did you not return only after you discovered there were no others like you so you wanted to become real only then did you return to serve in exchange for the magicians draoon on a pedestal answer which he never owed you in the first place but gave out of the generosity of his heart and did you care did you care for anyone or anything except yourself how many times did you abuse the magician calling him gnome how many other innocent people has your foul rag mouth wronged how many times has your perjury of translation caused mischief to those who trusted you where were you when the good ma gician needed you to warn the gap dragon away to avoid the disaster of the youth elixir he helped you in your infancy of awareness what favor did you return in his own infancy should he not have reason to curse the day he made you and gave you consciousness and selfdetermination cower wretch for surely the scourge must fall most heavily on your deserving hide indeed grundy did cower for the fury had bested him with the terrible justice of her accusation these were three awful creatures of retribution their words as devastating as their weapons they bore down on the three chastened people their deadly scourges ready to draw more than physical blood irene knew now that none of her plants could have stopped these terrible old women whose voices echoed the complaints of all neglected parents and that xaviers zapping would not have touched them even grundys sarcastic tongue was powerless here she had never heard the golem so accurately set back yet xavier had been cowed too and she herself humbled all three of them were retreating nowirene xavier and grundy in moments the scourges would cut into them and somehow irene knew those whips were poisonous their mere touch would draw copious blood and inflict extraordinary ag ony the wounds would fester and refuse to heal until the victims wished ardently for a clean and honest death now irene remembered stories about the furies punishing errant children it was bad luck even to mention their names tisi alee and megthe three horrors of guilt sorrow and suf fering and the worst of it was irene could not claim with any certainty that this savage retribution was wrong she had always thought other people would and should suffer for their cal lousness but had never realized that she was as guilty as they and deserved similar treatment dragon on a pedestal she tripped over a root and fell on her back unable to retreat any more tisi loomed over her the canine snout drooling spittle the animal breath rasping out in what seemed like a fiery fog the black wings were half spread and the scourge was lifted high for its devastating strike each thong glistening hungrily for its share of blood yet even worse than this physical threat was the emotional one irene realized that she would never get to tell her mother how important she the sorceress iris was and had always been to her daughter irene would never have the chance to make up for the years of neglect this was the crudest portion of her punishmentthe denial of absolution oh iris dear mother forgive me she cried in her heart as the scourge came down at her face knowing that plea would never be heard she no longer had even the will to turn her face aside she was doomed but the scourge did not land startled by the reprieve irene looked upand saw a shape interposed it was the zombie zora had taken the blow intended for irene strips ofzoras decayed flesh were dangling ripped off by the lash of the thongs but it seemed the zombie hardly felt them zombies were always losing flesh tisi looked into the rotten face of the zombie and retreated you are undead she shrieked i cant punish you the poison cant hurt you the whip cant draw your blood the truth cant sear your mind zora went on to intercept the next fury alee catching the blow intended for xavier the second crone recoiled similarly not knowing how to handle an undead person even if you lived i could not flay you the fury protested you never neglected your parents then zora rescued grundy pulling him out of the way while she absorbed megs blow and sacrificed more shreds of flesh it is wrong it is wrong meg screamed in frustration you have suffered more for less reason than any living creature i can add nothing to it but now the crones rallied reorienting on their original targets the zombie had caught them by surprise but could not stop them if they acted in concert dragon on a pedestal ffiiee ffiiee zora cried losing some lip and showing extraordinary animation for her kind generally the emotions of zombies were as atrophied as their bodies theesh nocht yyoors the three formidable furies hesitated daunted by the scolding of the undead and spiritually unsoiled woman they had neither physical nor moral power over her the three drew together in a huddle conferring in unintel ligible shrieks and woofs then deciding on a new strategy the furies turned faced the victims and lifted their left arms in unison as if to hurl something but those three left hands were empty look out grundy yelled its a curse the hideous hags are going to throw a the three arms descended each making a throwing arc irene and xavier hunched down their shoulders colliding zora flung herself back again interposing her body between the furies and their victims something like a wind stirred in the grass around them irene found herself on the ground half embracing xavier with the body of the zombie against them both the vicious furies had been partially foiled again their curse had struck zora instead of its intended objects but ev idently one curse was all each hag could throw in moments the three turned and departed huddling within their wingcloaks this horrible siege was over irene got up and dusted herself off that had been a re markable escape she saw xavier staring up at zora as if he had never seen her before itthe zomshe took the strike meant for me he exclaimed incredulously twice irene agreed for me too zombies are immune to physical pain and very hard to hurt they are undeadthe revived corpses of onceliving people theyre not bad folk at all if you can bring yourself to get to know them she was speaking for herself as much as for him this was the second time zora had saved her perhaps the second and third times if she counted the scourge and the curse as separate items zora seemed not to hear them as she unhunched herself and stood more or less erect the impact of the curse was not visible but it had to be considerable dragon on a pedestal she must have been some woman when she lived xavier said a better person than any of us probably so i never knew her alive but gather from what the furies said that she led a blameless life and was cruelly wronged by one not worthy of her a man xavier said grimly a worm of a man yes zora wobbled on her feet and irene moved over to take the zombies flaccid arm to steady her are you all right zora she asked solicitously ccurrsh the zombie said you took our curse irene agreed what was it what is supposed to happen to usto you i can tell you that grundy said climbing to his own feet i got caught by it irene realized that was true the zombie had blocked off the punishment from two of them but grundy had been behind her he had had no protection this time yet he seemed func tional so the curse couldnt be something like instant total collapse is itmaybe we can nullify it its a curse of misfortune the golem said one bad thing is going to happen which will make the victim wish he were dead i interpreted their screeching thats how i knew what they were up to well protect you from it irene said grundy shook his little head i doubt thats possible now that the curse has tagged me the best i can hope for is that youll find a way to abate it once it strikes and it will be twice for the zombie because she took your two curses irene hadnt thought of that aspect of course a curse was not a thing to be sloughed off like a tatter of flesh what would make a zombie wish she were dead she asked i dont know grundy said but i guess well find out when the misfortunes strike all too likely true irene looked at zora with mixed regret and puzzlement the zombie had beenwas still a truly nice person completely selfsacrificing but what possible penalty could she pay for her kindness irene put the matter out of her mind for now as there was dragon on a pedestal nothing she could do about it she checked the tree house lets sleep xap and chem may be late returning xavier agreed wordlessly evidently he was not certain how he felt about what his steed might be doing possibly he wasnt entirely pleased to see someone else tame the hippogryph theres room for you in the house zora irene said can you climb the ladder the zombie hesitated she was in bad condition even for her kind because of the savagery of the furies decayed bone showed where her flesh had been scourged away and her dress was so tattered it would have been indecent on any other female nnosh nneedth she began not need shelter irene asked do you stay outside be cause you want toor because your kind usually isnt welcome inside zora stood there not attempting an answer you have helped me and my friends twice irene said firmly maybe you saved my lifefrom the bonnacon and the furies it would be wrong for me to treat you like she broke off unwilling to say like a zombie you know its just about dark now xavier commented i can hardly see her she looks sort of slender and shadowed she dont seem half bad this way and the smells not bad neither more like soil as compliments went that wasnt much hut irene realized the youth meant well he had not had much experience with this sort of thing considering his background that was not surprising the scourge would have torn me apart grundy remarked literally theres worse things to be next to than a zombie irene addressed zora again so come join us inside the tree house youll heal better under cover you need sleep dont you that was a guess but it had become important to irene to make this gesture it might be some transference from her guilt about neglecting her mother irisoh the furies had scored therebut it was also simple gratitude zora had saved her from the bonnacon and irene had allowed herself almost to forget about that now zora had saved her again and this time there would be no forgetting this zombie was no longer dragon on a pedestal an unpleasant thing to be tolerated and no necessary evil this was a friend zora must indeed have been as xavier surmised some woman when she lived she was some woman now zora accepted the invitation and shambled to the ladder leading up to the tree house she tried to climb but her body was less functional than usual because of the scourging and her clumsy skeletal hands slipped off the rungs irene winced to see the scourge wounds knowing that her own flesh had very nearly suffered similarly obviously the poison of the whips was interfering with even zombie regeneration maybe in her healthiest state zora could have made it not now xavier stepped behind her put his two large hands at zoras somewhat sloppy waist and lifted once again irene noted how strong a man he was though he hardly seemed to put forth any effort the zombie rose like a feather xavier resembled his steed in this respect being the finest of physical specimens with this considerable assistance zora was able to scramble to the top of the ladder fortunately within the young mans reach and get her balance on hands and knees at the house portal she disappeared inside dropping some slivers of skin behind i never touched one of them things before xavier mur mured half to himself not with my hands course she was hanging on to me riding xap but i just sorta tuned her out as if she were a bag of garbage going to the dump but now after she took that scourge for meif i had been hit i guess my flesh would be dropping off and showing my bones he shook his head i never had no one do me a favor i didnt do back but how do you give back the favor of a life wheni mean she lost her life long before i ever knew her he clenched his fists in a frustration irene shared he was a decent man facing an insoluble ethical problem its not so bad touching her no worse than entrails from some monster i killed touch ing stuffit really dont mean nothing its how you feel about it she sure dont weigh much xavier was in his crude but honest fashion voicing sen timents similar to those irene had privately entertained to her half shame his reassessment parallelled hers there was no prejudice in xanth greater than that relating to zombies and dragon on a pedestal she had shared it though she knew better even millie the ghost who had loved a zombie for eight hundred years until he was at last restored to his living self as the zombie master even she did not permit many zombies in their castle although zombies had built that castle and now defended it castle roogna had always been defended by zombies yet they were not per mitted inside it nobody wanted to be close to a zombie but if zombies were not properly alive neither were they properly dead they did have feelings loyalty and courage as zora had so dramatically shown zora had done more and had asked less in return than anyone else on this odd excursion shes a decent person irene said knowing this to be an understatement so gross as to be obscene yeah too bad shes dead and there was the ultimate tragedy of it how could anyone repay a person who was not alive that was the wall against which each notion smashed irene climbed on up and into her monkeypuzzle chamber xavier and grundy got settled irene lay there in the dark there was certainly a smell from the zombie like rotted leaves or a small dead animal left in the sun but xavier was right it wasnt too bad especially when one remembered what zora had done chapter parnassus aap and chem were back by morning irene heard them amve and decided not to inquire it really wasnt her business that was why she was so infernally curious maybe it was her imagination irene thought but in the light dragon on a pedestal of dawn zora looked improved the scourge gouges had filled in so that bone no longer showed her flesh no longer hung in tatters and her eyes seemed restored to the point where they were capable of normal vision even her dress was whole now apparently renovating itself as part of the zombie process her hair was longer and fuller and less straggly with some of its original fair color showing it seemed that rest and shelter did mend a zombie somewhat this was the first case irene knew of in which a zombie had become less rather than more rotten with the passage of time but of course she had never before interacted this closely with a zombie for several days what had she ever really known about them little more than jokes how many zombies does it take to plant a light bulb she could no longer remember the punch line and didnt care to she was sure she would not find it very funny now there was one other factor she recalled human consider ation and caring that was one thing that was supposed to help a zombieand the one thing few if any zombies received but all of them had welcomed zora into their group after the episode of the furies perhaps they had after all returned part of the debt they owed her irenes original clothes were quite dry now so she no longer had to wear the towels or other substitutes that improved her outlook she grew milkweed and eggplant for breakfast for those who wanted it xap and chem were not hungry presum ably they had eaten on the run during the night chem projected her map the scenery ahead spread out in miniature here is the mountain of parnassus she explained indicating a large irregular area it was as if they were looking down on it from above she must have questioned xap closely about the details he perceived from the air in order to fill out what she saw from the knoll it has two peaks the one we want is here to the south the nine muses live on it the cave of the oracle is over there but well skirt around that to reach the peak where the tree of seeds grows its quite a climb but we can handle it if irene didnt like the smell of that hesitation if what if nothing interferes chem said reluctantly dragon on a pedestal what might interfere well xap says there are things on the other peak of par nassus thatof course we wont be traveling on that side of the mountain but wed better be prepared irene finished especially with that curse she had told chem about the visitation of the evening of course and the part zora had played what affects grundy and zora is likely to affect the rest of us since were traveling as a group so lets have the worst whats on that other peak ill have to give a little background chem said apolo getically unlike some centaurs she hesitated to show off her extensive classical education spit it out horsefoot grundy said anything bad will probably hit me first the shrine of the oracle was originally guarded by the python who had a keen insight into the fallibilities of man but the huge reptile was attacked and severely injured and driven out it survived only because it fled to the other peak of parnassus where the tree of immortality was and ale one of its leaves now the python is barred from the oracles cave but it is a most sagacious reptile and would do anything to return so it slithers about seeking some avenue if we were to stray into its present territory we wont irene said firmly not with your map to guide us what else the maenads they are the wild women of wine they dance ritually on the north slope tearing apart and consuming any creature they catch once they served the god of fertile crops but the old gods are gone now and the maenads serve no one except the tree of immortality which keeps them alive and youthful they sound like nymphs xavier remarked they may be related but their personalities are more like those of harpies or ogresses they are predators not prey though they are naked and beautiful i see irene said frowning she tended to be foolishly jealous of eternally young beautiful naked wild women once she herself had beenbut she stifled that thought so wild dragon on a pedestal women roam the slopes of parnassus well stay clear of them too for sure so here is the appropriate path chem concluded pointing out a dotted line on the map well have to stay right on it to be safe it is too bad you cant use xap to fly directly to the tree of seeds but the simurgh allows no one to enter parnassus by air because every so often dragons and griffins try to raid a hippogryph vaguely resembles a griffin in flight so xap knows it isnt safe for him to fly there nothing largei than a small bird can risk it xap can handle just about any airborne creature he might meet but the simurgh is something else im sure it is irene agreed getting more curious about this notorious bird we have to approach slowly by foot so the simurgh has time to study us and see that we are not raiders but serious visitors parnassus seems very choosy irene commented yes a select and strange group of creatures abides there we have to follow their rules or we will get nowhere thats why the witch xanthippe could not go herself the simurgh would know her for what she is and would never let her get near the tree of seeds it is not a mission i would have chosen myself irene admitted grimly but we must do what we must do they set off on the final stretch to parnassus as delineated on chems map zora rode behind xavier on xap again while irene and grundy remained on chem they trotted southeast but with more certain impetus for chem had traveled this route before xap now stayed on the ground and not because he was tired whether he wished to avoid the attention of the simurgh even this far away or simply to keep chem company irene wasnt sure but she suspected the latter those two semiequines must have had quite a night of it irene reflected xap spoke only in squawks but chem seemed to understand him perfectly now and he understood her irene remained surprised that chem should show such interest in a noncentaur yet human beings were noncentaurs too and she associated with them all the time was a human person any dragon on a pedestal more worthy than a hippogryph person a smart centaur cer tainly ought to be able to judge but irene suspected that chems dam cherie would not entirely approve what would the furies have said to chem in due course they came to the base of mount parnassus the jungle halted as if in deference to the great mountain so the view was clear there were indeed two peaks on each one half hidden in mists was a large and spreading tree they would avoid the tree of immortality on the north peak too much mischief had already been wreaked by the water of the fountain of youth which was surely related magic doesnt look like much grundy said lets hope youre right chem said i want to talk to the simurghnothing else and irene wants to get those seeds they crossed the channel at the foot of the mountain this was a dry creekbed filled with rounded stones it wasnt com fortable footing for hooves so xap spread his wings and leaped across risking this tiny bit of flight while chem picked her way carefully even so the stones tended to turn under her feet slowing her down further here tenderfoot ill find you a solid path grundy said impatiently he jumped down and began shoving at stones testing for solidity something struck at the golem grundy jumped back it bit me he exclaimed indignantly as a small snake slithered quickly away hardly the python irene said the golem was touching his little leg but did not seem to be crippled chem stiffened her four hooves firmly in place that snake looked very much like a dipsas i hope thats a misperception the cursed thing bit me grundy repeated pressing at the flesh of his leg im not a true golem any more you know im flesh now i hurt that was true grundy like millie the ghost had for some time been fully alive because of very special magic the furies had known too bad irene thought that no similar magic was available to restore zora zombie but good magician humfrey had been involved in the other case and he was no longer available dragon on a pedestal but she had better concentrate on the immediate problem whats a dipsas she asked chem who was now picking her way forward again cursed thing the centaur mused maybe not just a figure of speech i dont understand irene said annoyed hey got anything to drink the golem asked it was a dipsas chem said horrified i hoped i was wrong or that the snakes reputation was exaggerated its bite makes a person unquenchably thirsty curse irene repeated catching on the furies curse of misfortune yes the centaur agreed you told me how the furies came while xap and i were away and how grundy caught their curse this bite of the dipsas does seem to fit the description perhaps if you had caught the curse you would have been the one bittenor me if i had been there to meet the furies i was certainly vulnerable all too true zora has my curse irene said she did not get bitten so i think this one was intended specifically for grundy im starving of thirst grundy exclaimed find me a lake somebody irene looked around theres a beerbarrel tree behind us she dismounted picked her way through the treacherous stones of the riverbed keeping a nervous eye out for snakes and went to the huge swollen barrel of the tree now she realized why the streambed was drythe magic snake had caused all crea tures here to drink until the water was gone too bad that had not been obvious before she used her knife to punch a hole in the bark yellow beer spouted out this might not be the best liquid for the golem to drink but there was plenty of it enough to quench the thirst of a hundred golems grundy hurried up and put his little mouth to the stream of beer he gulped the stuff down insatiably irene watched with growing amazement as the golem swal lowed more than his own mass in beer and kept on drinking dragon on a pedestal the stream seemed to be flowing into a bottomless hole his body swelled up like a watermelon but still he drank finally the barrel ran dry and the flow stopped more more grundy cried though he was bursting out of his cloth ing irene had never seen a smaller fatter man im ravenous with thirst hie irene glanced again at the dry stream then at the empty tree this thirst was truly ferocious mere liquid obviously wouldnt abate it i dont know where theres more im drying up grundy cried popping a button i wish were dead that was another aspect of the curse of course what we need is not more liquid but a cure she said otherwise grundy will drink until he explodes chem had made her way across the riverbed and was now safely on mount parnassus as recall the only natural cure is a draught from a healing spring and dont know where xap squawked he says the winespring of the maenads quenches all thirst the centaur said thats fairly close but that spring must be on the north slope of parnassus chem said grimly the very place we dont want to go irene sighed yet grundy is dying of dehydration or of swelling we cant ignore that indeed the golem was chewing up the local vegetation trying to squeeze water out of the leaves irene dropped a seed and ordered it to grow in a moment a water hyacinth sprouted bursting with water the golem grabbed its leaves and flowers and crammed them into his mouth but plants couldnt hold him long already his swollen limbs looked shrunken as if dehydrating he had the worst of both conditions id like to have fracto the cloud here now irene muttered grundy would swallow him whole maybe xap and me can take him to the winespring xavier offered but xap doesnt dare fly here chem protested concerned for the welfare of the hippogryph yeah but he can gallop good dragon on a pedestal true chem agreed with one of her obscure smiles per haps we should separate and rejoin farther up the mountain when grundy is cured she projected her map the spring should be about here she said making it glow in the picture she had really learned a lot of geography from the hippogryph if you follow this route the dotted line progressed to intersect the glow you can rejoin us farther up the moun tainhere the line intersected the line of their route to the southern peak i really dont like breaking up our party irene said but i suppose we have little choice at the moment we cant let grundy die of thirst or whatever and xap is best able to avoid the maenads so it was reluctantly decided zora got down from the hip pogryph and grundy took her place xap galloped away around the northern curve of the mountain there go three fairly brave and foolish males chem mur mured as zora mounted behind irene lets hope we fairly sensible and timid females can com plete our mission irene said they moved up the slope parnassus was not a smooth mountain it was riddled with ridges gullies crevices and caves and the vegetation was odd strange seeds had sprouted probably from the tree of seeds there was a proliferation of paper trees and ink plants and secretarybirds zipped among them in seemingly pointless activity irene wondered what nat ural place a community like this had in the larger scheme of xanth for things generally interrelated but she could see noth ing worthwhile parnassus seemed pretty much wrapped up in its own concerns which hardly related to those of the world beyond there was a loud and sinister hiss ahead chem skidded to a halt all four hooves making grooves in the dirt the path ran through a small gorge here with sliding rubble on the slopes so it was not at all convenient to change the route but she didnt trust what was ahead chem unslung her bow from her shoulder and nocked an arrow like all centaurs she was an excellent archer she walked slowly forward there around a curve was a monstrous serpent its head dragon on a pedestal was half the size of irenes body carried at human height and its sinuous body extended back and around another curve the python irene whispered in horror what is it doing here i am the nemesis and the delight of females everywhere the serpent hissed i made the first woman blush and feel shame for the desire i aroused in her i will possess the last woman ever to bear a child bow down before me you vulnerable creatures this was more than a mere snake irene tried to protest but the pythons terrible gaze transfixed her chem fidgeted on her hooves caught by the same stare there seemed to be all the sinister masculine wisdom of eternity in those huge eyes to gether with all the masculine promise and threat and a desire as insatiable as the golems thirst that would destroy them long before it was sated yet neither irene nor chem could break the connection the python slid forward sinuously holding them with his hypnotic gaze his pale red tongue flicked out soon that awful mouth would gape showing the cruel fangs wwhaashh zora asked shedding some epiglottis as she tended to do when expressing herself with some force when irene didnt answer the zombie craned her neck to peer blankly ahead of the centaur then zora half scrambled half slid to the ground righted herself and shuffled forward she took her place in front of chem just as the head of the python arrived ffiieee sschnaake she cried for a moment zombie and python were eye to eye now it was the serpent who froze for the direct gaze of an aroused zombie was a sickening thing irene and chem snapped out of their trances the gaze of the python had been interrupted by zora freeing the other two irene was appalled and repelled by the memory of her fasci nation of a moment ago yet there had been a certain insidious appeal as well she had not while caught in the stare of the snake quite wanted to break it though she knew it meant doom did she have an urge for selfdestruction or was that merely part of the things spell dragon on a pedestal the centaur spun about so rapidly that irene had to grab the slender humanoid waist before her to remain mounted chems large rear end swung around to bang into both zombie and python knocking them into the rocky bank grab zora irene cried seeing the zombie staggering chem reached out and caught zora by an arm and hauled her in half carrying half dragging her the centaur moved down the path away from the menace behind them the huge serpent thrashed starting a rockslide that threatened to bury its low body irene knew the monster snake would soon be after them the python had been balked not defeated it was impossible for mere females to win over him she felt in her bag of seeds seeking something that would delay the reptile she had a tangle tree seed but that would take too long to growah here was a hedgehog plant seed she threw it to the ground grow the hedgehog sprouted sending out quills that pointed in every direction it was like an oversized pincushion that would be awkward to pass in any hurry but when she glanced back shielding her eyes with her hand so as to cut off any meeting of the reptiles deadly stare she saw the python sliding smoothly past the hedgehog the plant hadnt had time to grow big enough to block the whole channel hmm she fetched out two more seeds the first was false hops when she sprouted it it fragmented into a dozen miniature kangaroos who started hopping madly about they were not real of course kangaroos were mythical beasts not found in xanth when the python snapped at one he encountered only leaves and stem but this was a distraction that slowed the aggressive reptile next she tossed an alumroot it wasnt much to look at but with luck the snake would snap it up too just to get it out of the way the python did the alumroot was ripped out of the ground and crunched to pieces its juices squirting irene was reminded with horror of the way the bonnacon had crunched zora then the serpent paused just as the bonnacon had dragon on a pedestal irene smiled alum had a special magical effect on living flesh it was astringent the phytons mouth shrank as the soft tissues of it drew together but the hard tissues such as the teeth did not shrink in moments the head was quite distorted the flesh tightening about the bone startled the python jerked his head back and tried to spit out the root but could not get it past his purse stringtight mouth desperate the reptile tried the other route and swallowed the root irenes smile broadened alum was an emetic too in a moment the big snake was vomiting as well as it could through its constricted throat and mouth bubbles started coming out of its ear slits the worst thing it could have done was to swallow the alum that gave them enough time to stop and get zora properly mounted you saved us again irene told her you may have absorbed a double curse of misfortune but you are certainly lucky for us for a moment irene wondered whether being consumed by the python was one of the misfortunes the zombie had taken on herself but realized it could not be for it had not happened i wonder what misfortune is to a zombie chem re marked her mind evidently on the same question that was bothering irene it cant be the ordinary type not a snakebite or a bad fall that curse might not apply at all irene conjectured to us getting hurt or killed would be a misfortune but a zombie is already dead or half dead many people would consider that the ultimate misfortuneto become a zombiebut zora is already there she turned her head to address the zombie directly what is misfortune to you nnoshingg zora replied nothing irene agreed so she was correct zora was al ready undergoingthe ultimate misfortune the curse had to be meaningless but she couldnt be quite sure i think we have gotten away chem said but now we are going in the wrong direction downhill we must have been going the wrong way before irene dragon on a pedestal said we probably veered too far north and intersected the territory of the python no we were on our plotted course the centaur insisted the python is on the southern peak he must be testing the boundaries moving back to his original haunts we hadnt allowed for that it was a long time ago that he was banished and things change well now we know irene said i dont want to meet that gaze again there was just a smidgeon of doubt to that though she hated that doubt well have to find another path up the mountain we can intercept our original route above the python who will be looking for us down here so that the boys can find us chem projected her map we can travel past the oracles cave she decided thats not too far out of our way they picked their way to the alternate path irene planted a creeping fig seed in the path they were leaving to fool the python who she knew would be recovering soon from the effects of the alum it had been a small alumroot not enough really to hurt the huge snake and anyway alum was not gen erally fatal the pythons hunger would be greater than ever because of the loss of the contents of his stomach the fig would creep on down toward the base of the mountain making it seem that the party had continued that way of course the figs smell would be different but it was still worth the try maybe the reptile didnt track by smell the crannies in the mountain became more pronounced here and finally opened into crevices and fissures from which in toxicating fumes rose they hurried by not wanting to expe rience any more of this than necessary the oracle sniffs the vapors and makes crazy prophecies as i understand it that always come true chem remarked we certainly dont need any of that for our own mission we certainly dont irene agreed maybe the powers that be on parnassus like to go crazy on fumes but were more sensible people she hoped this was true they made their way above the cave region where the landscape evened out somewhat and were soon close to their original course they saw no sign of xaps hoofprints so they dragon on a pedestal proceeded slowly in order to let the males catch up when they did intersect the path irene could not help worrying however suppose their companions had fallen into dire straits and did not return then they heard a screaming from the north i think thats more trouble chem said grimly parnassus was nothing but trouble so far the maenads irene agreed in pursuit of prey we should have known the males could not touch the winespring without arousing its guardians but they had been brave to try she reminded her self we dont dare hide until we know whether xap and xavier and grundy need help irene glanced back oh no the python wasnt fooled hes after us again do you have a suitable plant the centaur asked nervously i dont want to be caught between two horrors irene checked im getting low but these should help she tossed down several seeds grow plants sprouted rapidly spreading across a fairly broad area what are they chem asked glancing forward and back something to distract each threat i hopehorehounds and snake plants chem eyed the bristling houndheads and snakeheads on the plants arent they as much of a threat to us as to the enemies no snake plants only bite snakes and horehounds only bite now the hippogryph burst into sight running powerfully pursued by a crowd of naked women they were young and healthy and yes nymphlike with fine firm legs narrow waists and voluptuous bosoms but they were also wildhaired and wildeyed and awful imprecations spewed from their snarling red mouths several of them carried things that most resembled gobbets of raw flesh the python had been sliding slowly close tongue flicking with anticipation now he brightened further his jaws worked and slaver dripped he accelerated toward the maenads dragon on a pedestal i dont know which is worse the male or the female threats irene said halfway fascinated wed better gallop chem said suiting action to word they galloped chems course up the mountain converged with xaps and they ran side by side until it was evident they were not being pursued then they reined in and turned to look back the python and the maenads were not it seemed on friendly terms the giant snake was biting one woman after another while the wild women were tearing with tooth and claw at the serpentine body and gouging bloody chunks out the snake did not have time to swallow any morsels but the maenads were no better off for the huge reptiles coils were switching too rapidly about for easy consumption it seemed to be a fairly even battlethe womanpreying monster against the most predatory women now and then a woman would stand frozen caught by the pythons terrible stare but then three more would cut in between breaking the spell the reptile had succeeded in fascinating irene and chem but there were far too many maenads to be similarly held meanwhile the snake plants and horehounds were snapping indiscriminately at both sides making the carnage even more bloody pieces of flesh went flying up and blood coursed down the channels of the mountain this was serious business irene found her gorge rising and had to avert her face she really wasnt much for such violence however common it might be on parnassus and disliked seeing these vicious creatures in action their behavior did little for either the masculine or the feminine image parnassus is a rough place especially for the natives grundy said echoing her thought but the golem was enjoying it that reminded her grundy have you been cured i think so the golem paused to belch he did appear to be normal again certainly the bloat was gone that winespring is potent everything was quiet until he drank xavier said then the damsels appeared dragon on a pedestal damsels irene exclaimed those are biuh bad women oh i dont know grundy said i understand wild women can be a lot of fun irene stifled her retort knowing the golem was baiting her he was back to normal all right screaming and waving their claws xavier continued i didnt want to zap any of those fantastic creatures they being of the gentle sex hardly gentle irene protested watching another bleeding hunk of meat fly up above the melee like yourself he said i just dont like to im like a maenad a wild woman irene screeched out raged then she had to laugh knowing she was reacting exactly like a maenad gentle xavier clarified and lovely he squinted at her in fact maybe maw was right lets get on with our mission irene said quickly she should have kept her mouth shut to begin with xavier was really a very nice young man and she remained privately flat tered by his perception of her but this was as far as it could ever go she had a husband and child to return to after all they resumed the climb letting the sounds of carnage fade behind them soon the way became steeper until they were unable to progress farther and had to move around the southern slope of the mountain instead xap could fly on up xavier said and maybe get exterminated by the simurgh chem re torted thats not a viable option they came to a kind of palace set into the mountainside it did not have high towers but did have ornate columns and archways with curlicues of stone and carvings of animals and people this was no primitive hideout it was someones highly civilized retreat in a small court before it a woman sat at a table an open chest of books at her side she wore a floorlength white robe and was of wellkept middle agethe kind of figure of a woman irene hoped to be when time shoved her into that age bracket dragon on a pedestal the woman looked up as the group approached may i help you she inquired unalarmed she spoke with a cultured accent her voice quiet but thoroughly competent irene dismounted and went to the table uncertain how much of this to take at face value the maenads after all looked like nymphs but hardly acted like them if this were some other kind of trapbut she had to give it the benefit of the doubt we are seeking the tree of seeds and the simurgh she explained we cant seem to find the path to the top of the mountain the woman nodded she had curly dark hair neatly pinned back and an elegantly straight nose and who might you be she asked with mild interest i am irene and these are my friends chem zora grundy xavier and xap ah so you are the current queen of xanth the woman exclaimed brightening how very nice of you to honor us with a visit irene was startled how could you know that as far as i know no one from parnassus has been to castle roogna and this is the first time any of us have i am clio the muse of history i am naturally conversant with the significant events of the realm the muse of history chem exclaimed excitedly stepping close the one who writes the magic texts clio inclined her head politely some of them centaur most recently covered the episode of the night mare and the salvation of xanth from the nextwave invasion your kind has been an excellent customer for such references and of course the good magician not any more irene murmured darkly he will recover in proper course your friend will see to that the muse said glancing at zora he will irene asked incredulously but theres no fast cure for youth but her talent compensates you see irene stared at zora her talent but shes a clio put her hand to her lips oh my thats in a future history text which i have not yet completed we have a long dragon on a pedestal lead time and sometimes i lose track i shouldnt have men tioned it a future history text there was magic of a high order here how could zora zombie relate to the good magician whom she didnt even know and are the other muses here too chem asked cal liope erato urania indeed clio agreed this is where we live here on mount parnassus the home of the arts the sciences and mem ory the others are resting at the moment but you may meet them if you wish we have never intended to be aloof from the public though we find a certain isolation to be beneficial chem shook her head regretfully if i start talking with all the muses it will be years before i stop and i have a more immediate mission i shall have to be satisfied just putting your locale on my map will you tell us how to reach the summit of parnassus i regret to advise you that there is no easy way clio said talent isnt enough any more most talented people never make it they get consumed by the python or the maenads in literal or figurative fashion so we have discovered irene said and we understand it is not safe to fly but i must rescue my daughter ivy and first i must get three seeds from the ivy clio asked let me fetch thalia she rose turned gracefully and glided toward the palace entrance who is thalia irene asked muse of comedy chem murmured and of planting planting well i certainly can relate to that but clio returned with thalia the other muse carried a face mask that was broadly smiling and a shepherds crook and wore a wreath of ivy i think the ivy is the key chem said see if you can enlist the muses help no need thalia said overhearing her i know of the sorceress but why do you seek her here when she is in the cave of the cyclops the cyclops irene cried dismayed i thought the witch xanthippe had her captive dragon on a pedestal no longer thalia said xanthippe had already lost pos session when you undertook her mission it is a humorous irony she lifted the laughing mask to her face momentarily all thisfor nothing irene demanded sputtering that witch deceived me not so thalia said xanthippe thought she had ivy but no person of ordinary talent can long constrain a sorceress ivy and the dragon escaped in a manner that only such a person could arrange they will in due course be in somewhat greater difficulty however your excursion here does relate ive got to get back irene exclaimed we couldnt possibly return in time to be of any use chem reminded her it shouldnt take much longer to complete our mission than to abort it perhaps the simurgh will give us useful advice since that bird knows everything yes we often exchange information with the simurgh thalia agreed oh i hate this irene said stamping her foot i just want ivy back safely easier to save all xanth clio murmured exactly what does that mean irene flared for a child of that name and that power and for a talent like yours i will help thalia said touching her wreath it was so kind of you to name such a remarkable individual so it had been coincidence since irene had not known about this muse she had needed a name beginning with that related to plants since the baby had been a girl had it been a boy they would have settled on a name beginning with d after his father relating to the inanimate but it did not seem politic to make an issue of that now and perhaps it was less coincidental than it seemed there were few true coincidences in xanth meanwhile why did thalia keep referring to ivy as a sor ceress and what did clio mean about saving xanth irene had a nasty feeling that these were not idle fragments of news but she was sure that she would get no clarifications merely by asking the muses were as much aware of the future as they were of the past and did let slip aspects of each but it seemed they were not supposed to leak the future to ordinary folk how can we get to the top of parnassus quickly dragon on a pedestal thalia considered some ride a book to the heights she indicated one of clios texts which rose out of the chest and hovered in the air before them but this method is precarious for no one knows which book will rise all the way irene eyed the floating tome it seemed very small and uncertain i dont care to trust myself to that even if the simurgh permits that sort of flight id soon fall off most do thalia agreed they have such high hopes then fall so low especially when the climate is adverse some make it by promotion but her toomerry smile suggested that was not a viable option either in this instance some do it by sheer luck but the only reasonable route is that of time and persistence we dont have time irene protested thalia paced in a small circle then i suppose you will have to do it the hard way for you for this occasion i think the ivy should do she lifted the wreath from her neck and set it at the base of the cliff at the edge of the temple i must not employ my power for the benefit of a traveler but you may use yours irene caught on grow she ordered the ivy the ivy grew vigorously the wreath sent out several shoots and these quickly found the face of the cliff they attached themselves to the surface of the mountain their little suckers supporting the stems the vines thickened and became sturdy and continued to reach up the mountain but xap and i cant climb that chem protested our hooves ill get the feather for you irene said you can wait here and talk to the muses well have to return this way and so we shall rejoin you then i suppose thats best the centaur said without real regret she had wanted to meet the simurgh but she also wanted to talk with the muses and the climb was clearly impossible for her the specialization that made her species fine runners made her a poor climber i dont think zora should try it either irene glanced at the zombie remembering the muses ref erence to her zora continued to look improved but this was dragon on a pedestal no minor climb up a ladder to a tree house yes she would have too much trouble but can handle it grundy said with zest he was right his small weight and tight grasp gave him a real advantage here too bad irene would have been happier without his smart remarks which could aggravate the simurgh when the ivy growth was solid enough and high enough irene xavier and grundy climbed up it finding plenty of footholds and handholds in the twining stems this was a very luxuriant and strong variety of ivy as befitted the muse of planting and irene knew it would offer complete support she remembered how she had climbed a plant over a dozen years ago in mundania to help dor use his talent in a castle that had taken place in the days when she had been young and impetuous and foolish and funloving the halcyon days when everyone had been desperate to know what color her panties were now of course no one cared her youth had flown hey doll remember that time in onesti when dor was embarrassed to see your grundy began thinking to tease her irene leaned over and kissed him on the top of his little head remember the golem blanched i must be losing my touch he grum bled it was quite a climb but irene was at home with plants especially this variety and she kept reminding herself that she was doing it for her daughter of course her daughter was no longer in the witchs power but still the sooner she got this mission done the sooner she could be on her way to rescue ivy according to the muses this mission did relate and it seemed they were in a position to know anyway she climbed mentally repeating the name to herself with each heave upward ivy ivy ivy it helped motivate tiring muscles grundy had no trouble as he was forever climbing things he was like a little monkeyshine xavier was eternally robust his muscles flexing smoothly he seemed to be enjoying the mild effort of the climb so they made good progress up the steep face of the mountain irene looked down to see how far they had come and experienced instant vertigo no more of that dragon on a pedestal they came to a gentler slope near the top and were able to leave the vine though irene made sure she could grab onto it again if she happened to fall she felt less secure on this moun tain face than she had when flying the birdofparadise plant because the drop seemed so much more immediate her arms were tired but not numb she was well enough off again she looked back saw the surface of parnassus falling away out of sight and again felt abruptly dizzy it was much worse looking down from the precarious top than up from the solid base never look back she thought when at the height then she looked forwardand saw the tree the tree of seeds was absolutely huge its roots dug into the domed top of the mountain its trunk ascended massively and its branches spread out as if to encompass the whole of xanth the foliage was highly varied for this was the tree of all species producing fruits and seeds of every kind that ex isted to irene it was the most wonderful tree that ever could be she looked north to the other peak of parnassus and saw the tree of immortality from this distance it looked minor but she was sure it was similar in size to the one on this peak proximity made these trees much more formidable she returned her gaze to the tree of seeds there on a large and high branch perched the simurgh a bird the size of a roc whose feathers were like veils of light and shadow and whose crested head was like fire it moved half spreading its enormous wings and they were like mist over a mountain thats some creature xavier breathed it was indeed irene had expected to be impressed but the sheer enormity and beauty of the simurgh threatened to over whelm her if the tree of seeds was a monarch among trees so was the simurgh a monarch among birds ill try to talk to it grundy said nervously thats my job after all do not bother golem irene looked about startled and saw xavier doing the same while grundy was literally knocked off his feet thats the bird he exclaimed sitting up thats the simurgh talking speak your needs the simurgh said in all their minds dragon on a pedestal neither grundy nor xavier was able to formulate anything irene was the one with the mission and as the only woman present she was the natural leader she gulped and started to speak first we need a fea a what the monstrous bird demanded a irene began again who put you up to this mortal woman there was something ominous about the way the bird proj ected the concept mortal life was not necessarily long abashed irene began the i should have known that witch xanthippe is a thief from way back always wanting what she does not de serve hey featherbrain thats my mother youre insulting xavier protested in the foolhardy fashion of his sex one gigantic and brilliant eye shifted to cover him xavier was obviously daunted but held his bit of ground bravely enough he had been stung by the indictment of the furies now he was standing up for his mother you ask for this tasty man this time the accent was on tasty well sure xavier said nervously i never did nothing for my mother before so its time i you have profited from the lesson of alecto the si murgh projected you wish to become a dutiful son i guess so xavier admitted i know im not much and i cant say i agree with everything maw does but she did try to do right by me and i reckon it aint never too late to start those old cronesuh the three furiesthey really had some thing to say you know so i filial respect is good even when the object is not worthy the simurgh projected to marry and settle down is good but your mothers design errs in one respect you may not take a woman who is already spoken for xavier glanced at irene who found herself blushing for no good reason the simurgh could read a persons thoughts what had it seen in xaviers mind the young man was taken aback i may not but maw said find another woman dragon on a pedestal uh yes sir i yes maam the bird corrected him only a male would not realize that females are the keepers of the seeds yes maam xavier agreed abashed some other woman then you shall carry the feather to xanthippe the simurgh flicked a wing and a tiny feather flew out sailing through the air toward them as it approached it seemed to grow larger what had appeared small on the giant bird was not small elsewhere it floated directly to xavier who hastily raised his hands to catch it the tiny feather turned out to be half the length of a man it glistened iridescently a beautiful thing in itself having all colors and no color xavier tucked it into his belt where it was suspended like a sword gee thanks maam i and you the simurgh projected returning her attention to irene what else has the witch charged you with and why do you accede she thought she had my daughter irene said she felt as if she were five years old and standing before the grand mother of all grandmothers trying to justify her foolishness now i suppose i dont have to get those seeds since what seeds the seeds of what the bird spread her wings and half lifted from the branch flashing light and dark bands of fog out from her person ooo now youve done it greenpants grundy muttered no mortal dare possess the seeds of doubt dissension and war the bird thundered mentally yes maam irene agreed faintly finding herself relieved she had had her doubts about delivering such potent seeds to such a person why not birdbrain grundy asked recovering his normal impudence shut up irene and xavier said together an intriguing question the simurgh responded evi dently the appelation birdbrain didnt bother her as her bird dragon on a pedestal brain was perhaps the most powerful brain in xanth possibly the witch does deserve those seeds no theres no need irene started she shall have them the bird decided she jumped on the branch and the entire tree shook several fruits fell down and rolled toward irene as they came near they gained ve locity and bounced over the irregularities of the terrain irene watched in growing alarm afraid she would be unable to catch them the three fruits landed close and burst apart their seeds flew up one zinged smack into grundys stomach knocking him down again another zoomed at xaviers head he reached up reflexively and caught it in one hand the third arced toward irene she caught up her skirt spread it and captured the seed in it doubt xavier said uncertainly handing her his seed its outline was vague it was hard to tell for sure exactly what it was dissension grundy continued argument vely passing along his seed it had sharp spines making it difficult to handle without getting hurt and war irene finished wamingly fishing the third from her skirt it resembled a mushroomshaped cloud she put them away carefully in a pocket she hoped the simurgh was correct in issuing these she knew their potential for abuse was staggering and for you good woman the simurgh projected all you can catch she spread her wings flapped with a noise like rumbling thunder rose briefly into the air then dropped like a boulder she bounced on the branch the tree of seeds vibrated so vigorously that all its foliage became hazy seeds flew out in an expanding sphere already freed from their fruits so thickly that the light of the sun was screened patterns of shadow played across the dome of mount parnassus forming fleeting pictures of birds and trees in a moment the wave of seeds reached irene pelting her like sleet she screamed half in amazed delight half in horrordelight at this oppor tunity to gain wonderful new seeds perhaps of types never before grown in xanth and horror at the loss of the great dragon on a pedestal majority of offerings at the same time she realized now how unusual plants could spring up in places where they had never grown before the simurgh must have bounced on a branch and flung them loose from the tree of seeds who could guess where the present rain of seeds would fall and what oddities would manifest in the coming seasons grundy opened his mouth to say somethingand swal lowed a seed that shut him up irene spread her skirt again catching everything she could seeds struck her body and slid down into the basin of the skirt a pitifully small selection from the mass passing her yet of incalculable value in a moment the hail of particles was over dazed irene looked around no seeds remained anywhere on the top of the mountain all had rolled or slid over the edge and somehow she knew they were forever beyond recovery but her skirt was full seeds of every description rested within it many were tiny motes some were like snowflakes others were like grains of sand others like puffs of cotton and others like little pods they were all colors and sizes and shapes and textures and densities she recognized some like chinaberry miniature tea cups airplant sundrop shin ing brightly gum peacock plant with pretty spread tails and blue fem but many others were unfamiliar what was this one that looked like a pair of crossed bones or the ones like hairpins she would have to get them home and look them up in the castle roogna classification manuals before she dared grow them what a fabulous treasure you should look at you grundy exclaimed seeds in your green hair seeds in your slippers seeds in your boo he caught her fierce glare and modified his term bosom he concluded now a problem manifested how can i carry all these seeds irene asked i cant let go of my skirt if she tried to use her hands the skirt would fall and the seeds would slide out she knew she would lose any that touched the ground here the disappearance of all the other seeds made that clear dragon on a pedestal the simurgh had given her a gift but had not made it easy she could keep only those seeds she could catchand hold ill help you xavier said gallantly he started picking seeds out of her hair and dropping them into her spread skirt when he reached for the ones caught lower she had to demur thank you xav ill get the others myself in due course she had enough problems without his fishing for seeds in her bosom while she stood with skirt raised unable to free her hands he had agreed to find another woman but there was no sense tempting him grundy was meanwhile picking the seeds off her shoes and depositing them in the dress girl you sure still got em he remarked glancing up under her skirt irene glared again and again he amended himself seeds i mean i didnt drop a one now she had most of the seeds in one placerbut still couldnt use her hands what was she to do she couldnt abide the thought of losing any of them not even a single seed it might be the most valuable one of all whatever it was seeds were the most important thing she knew next to her husband and daughter she had to save them all how you going to climb back down xavier inquired oh bother that was exactly the problem irene had an embarrassment of riches and it seemed to have trapped her she sighed the seeds came first she took several nottoo deep breaths then faced xavier xav would you please undo my skirt its a wraparound it unsnaps at the waist the young man gawked oh no miss i wouldnt do that the big bird told me not to not to take up with a woman already spoken for irene finished that is excellent advice and certainly i am spoken for so you dont need to worry about that now i ask you this favor as a friend who is going to find some other woman and therefore has no interest in me to help me get these seeds home to do that i must wrap them up in my skirt and to do that i must take it off since my hands are not free you and grundy will have to help me you must remove my skirt and grundy will tie it together it is all perfectly in order she hoped she had phrased it properly and that she was not blushing dragon on a pedestal this was not a situation she would have cared to explain to her husband xavier pondered uh yeah i guess so but still it dont seem right the snap is to the side undo it carefully and unwrap the skirt slowly so no seeds get dumped she spoke firmly de termined to do what she had to do oh sure maam the young man fumbled at her waist he was not at all good at this men generally werent you sure got a tight watch it grundy cut in grinning snap here xavier finished unlike the golem he had not changed his original thought then he got it loose and unwrapped the skirt grundy whistled look at that again he was interrupted by irenes warning glare glares could be exceedingly useful at a time like this pair of ankles he finished somewhat lamely you got a seed in your xavier said i mean in the band to yourthe green theyre called panties yokel grundy said before irene could catch him with her eye theyve never before been seen by human eye leave the seed irene said evenly grundy you tie the knot xavier brought the free side of the skirt around to the front she continued to hold up the sides of her basin while xavier held the rest of her skirt which was now a more or less oblong swatch of cloth grundy climbed up on the bag formed as they folded the skirt up and over the seeds and tied it in a good topknot the golem had originally been made of wood and cloth knotted together so he understood the process his knot would hold the bag was complete and not a seed had been lost now irene picked the seed out of her panty band still wearing that same pair i see grundy remarked innocently arent they getting a little old by now my panties match my complexion irene said with what she hoped was humor she was not about to explain the niceties of maintaining changes of clothing it had been bad enough dragon on a pedestal when her present clothes had gotten soaked during the night forcing her to grow substitutes while these dried she did not normally wear her underclothing several days in a row the golem knew that he just wanted to force her to talk about titillating things in the presence of xavier there were levels and levels of grundys mischief now lets get on down the mountain she turned to face the trunk of the main ivy plant clinging to the side of the knoll this was another problem she had a goodsized bag to carry and it wfighed a fair amount she could heft it with one handbut she needed two hands to climb down the vine she didnt dare drop the bag down first it would burst apart when it struck below and the seeds would be lost when they scat tered what was she to do now xavier saw the problem i can carry the bag for you miss it dont weigh much for me irene looked at him considering he remained a fine mus cular man but he too would need two hands for climbing so couldnt safely carry the bag down he might have held on to something less bulky with his teeth but not this fortunately grundy came up with the answer one of you go down a bit and the other hand down the bag then the other can climb below and take the bag again stairstep it down itll take time but the bag will get there yeah sure thatll work xavier agreed removing his gaze from irenes torso he clambered over the brink and grasped the vines readily lowering himself when his head was just below the brink he hooked his left hand firmly in the ivy and reached up with his right hand it down he called he means the bag grundy informed irene she didnt bother to glare at him this time she handed it down xavier had no trouble holding the bag as long as he didnt have to move now it was time for her she didnt relish descending a vertical vine in her panties but really it was not worse than wearing a bathing suit when she had been a teenager she had believed that the mere sight of those celebrated green panties would drive men mad so naturally she had taken every op portunity to proffer fleeting glimpses of them now she was dragon on a pedestal in heralaslate twenties and long past such illusions if only she had known what was coming she would have come prepared preparedhow if she had not worn a skirt she could not have caught these seeds it would have seemed silly to bring a big bag so maybe it was just as well the way it had hap pened no sense dawdling she swung her legs over the edge and found footholds in the vine she knew xavier was looking up at her legs but that could not be helped besides he was worried that she might fall in moments she would be below him anyway she paused glancing back up at the tree of seeds and the monstrous sapient bird perched on it farewell simurgh and thank you she called farewell good woman the bird responded remember the nature of the seeds you carry scant chance she would forget these seeds represented wealth beyond her fondest prior imaginings irene resumed her descent knowing that she would prob ably never again meet the like of the simurgh chapter cyclopean eye in the morning ivy and hugo and stanley peeked over the edge of their ledge to spy out the worst it was con firmed a monster slept across the cave entrance they looked about the rest of the cave seeking some other exit there was none this was a oneentrance domicile and the monster blocked that one drogon on a pedestal can we sneak out past him ivy asked before he wakes hugo inspected the monster it was humanoid hairy and huge there was no gap between it and the walls of the mouth of the cave wed have to climb over its legs he said i dont think it would sleep long then maybe hell go away soon ivy said but as she spoke the giant rolled over so that his horren dously ugly face was toward them and opened his eye uhoh hugo said it was a fair comment for the giant saw them ho he roared with a voice like mottled thunder and scrambled to his feet the cave entrance was high enough to admit two and a half ordinary people standing on each others heads but the hairy pate of the giant barely cleared it midgets in cave the gaping mouth roared run for it hugo cried in a fit of inspiration they tried they slidscrambled down to the floorbut the only place to run was toward the monster and his huge hairy knobbly legs barred the way his enormous eye seemed to flash as it watched them and his gigantic wooden club formed from the trunk of a medium ironwood tree hovered menacingly the three of them lost what little nerve they had remaining and backed away but the giant followed them poking forward with the club what you do in cave he roared causing sand to rattle loose and sift down from the ceiling ivy was terrified but she knew her friends were brave we must fight him she declared well make him let us go hugo exchanged an incredulous glance with stanley the logic of women was indecipherable then he turned a blank face to ivy fight him throw fruit at him she said encouragingly but my fruit is rotten no it isnt he remembered thats right it isnt any more but rotten fruit is okay for this he conjured a huge supempe tomato and hurled it at the giant it struck about halfway up splattering the crude animalskin clothing with drippy red tomatobrains dragon on a pedestal and you stanley with your superhot steamyou can toast his toes she said encouragingly the little dragon pumped up his steam it was indeed su perhot now and he found his courage returning if ivy thought he could fight the giant effectively maybe he could he braced himself aimed his snout precisely and issued a searing jet of whitehot steam that heated the giants callused warty big left toe the giant paused taking a moment to realize that something was wrong it was after all a long way from his toe to his head and the pain took time to travel through the poorly main tained nerve channels the aroma of cooking meat wafted up from the affected digit the giant sniffed he licked his lips with a long sloppy tongue that smelled good then the pain plowed through the sludge clogging the last nerve channel and reached the pain center he roared again stalactites picked up the impulse vibrating like tuning forks and a pile of old fish scales jumped regis tering two notches on the earthquake scale the wind from the roar blew the little dragon head over tail interfering with his aim his remaining breath of steam shot up in a vertical geyser and petered out hugo threw another fruitthis time an overripe water melon it was too heavy for him to heave high so it splatted on the giants hot toe cooling it ivy realized that they werent making much progress think of something hugo she cried youre smart i am hugo still found this hard to believe especially in the morning but he discovered he was smarter than he had supposed and he did think of something cherries he cried after all they had worked pretty well to disrupt fracto the bad cloud when the three children were fleeing it he started heaving cherries and they exploded all around the giant with fancy red booms but they were too small to have much effect on a target of this size a pineapple hugo said it too had proved to be an effective fruit in the past with some sweet results he heaved one this was considerably more powerful and the explosion dragon on a pedestal set the giants animal skin on fire the conflagration was closer to the pain center and the nerve channels had already been reamed out so the smell of roasting meat hardly got started before the new roar shook the cave the giant danced about smashing out the flames with fist and club in the course of this activity the monster bent down for a moment his eye hovered near the dragon stanley shot out a blast of steam that bathed the eye owwwgh the giant cried clapping his hands to his face as the club dropped to the floor ungh smarts now we can go hugo cried happily stanley blinded him oh ivy exclaimed she paused to peer up at the tears squeezing out between the monsters fingers poor thing hey we gotta go hugo said before he starts blocking off the door again but his eye she said she had sympathy for anyone who cried for any reason once she had gotten dust in her eye and it had teared something awful suppose it doesnt get better so what who cares what happens to a mean old monster her lip firmed rebelliously care i didnt really want to hurt him hugo exchanged a look of bafflement tinged with disgust with the dragon they found this feminine sensitivity as be wildering as her sorceress talent you want to help the mon ster well i guess if he needs it ivy said till his eye gets better maybe and then hell eat us hugo said ivy couldnt definitely refute that so she ignored it she called to the giant who was now standing silently blinking his sore eye from which huge tears were flowing does it hurt bad giant im sorry the giant seemed as surprised as hugo and stanley had been me you talk to me you see any other gross awful oneeyed hairy giants in here hugo inquired sarcastically i see nothing at moment the giant said rubbing his orb with a callused fist dragon on a pedestal dont do that ivy cried remembering admonitions by her mother youll get dirt in it and make it worse the giant stopped immediately it seemed he was responsive to the voice of female authority it hurt but will mend he said i got steamed worse before and mended okay im glad ivy said we didnt mean to hurt you really we just wanted to get away so you wouldnt eat us why you not say so the giant demanded i not eat people too small bad taste i let you go i dont believe you hugo said all i ask what you do in cave the giant pointed out blinking his eye why you not answer me now ivy and hugo exchanged glances then looked at stan ley who rippled a shrug down the length of his body i guess we didnt think of it ivy confessed we just thought naturally youdwere only children you know the giants eye finally cleared though it was red around the rim and still rather watery he sat down with a thump that made the earthquake scales jump again i not know or not have yelled get monkeys come in steal bones we wouldnt do that ivy said quickly we just needed a good place to sleep we didnt know it was your cave she leaned forward confidentially for the giants face was now not nearly so far distant there are monsters out there you know sure there are the giant agreed good thing too what i eat i dont trust him hugo said hugo doesnt trust you ivy informed the giant privately well i not trust him neither the giant replied disgrun tled he fire my uniform im sure hugo is sorry i am not hugo exclaimed it was war oh that different the giant said all fair love and war yes hugo agreed mollified my mother says that she know mothers know what bomb you use a pineapple hugo conjured another and held it in his hand all bright yellow with a green top i conjure fruit that good talent the giant said wish i do magic dragon on a pedestal why dont we all be friends ivy suggested for she was a friendly child the giant laughed real people not friends of cyclops he protested why not that stumped him now that she made him consider the matter friendship seemed more reasonable he didnt know she was a sorceress or that what she perceived tended to become more real just tradition i spose were too young to know about tradition ivy pointed out oh well okay be friends have some monster the cyclops reached across the cave and hauled up the dead griffin he had brought with him during the night it was half eaten but considerable mass remained ivy recoiled its all gooky with ick blood the cyclops explained taste good i lick off hunk for you then it nice and clean thank you ivy said remembering her manners but i guess im not really that hungry she glanced about but maybe stanley would like some the dragon agreed immediately the cyclops tore off a hind leg and dumped it down before stanley who chomped blissfully into it would you like some fruit hugo asked feeling neg lected i can conjure some more the cyclops eyed the pineapple uh thanks but that not nice for teeth and bum tongue oh i didnt mean this hugo said carefully setting down the pineapple i meant regular fruit he conjured a hand of bananas and proffered it the cyclops eye widened bnans not taste in decades got big kind oh sure anything hugo happy to show off his present power conjured a hand of plantains this was of course a giant hand and each finger looked like a monstrous banana but was too tough for a normal person to eat raw the cyclops tore one plantain off and popped it into his mouth skin and all he chomped down oh slurp he ex claimed with his mouth full of squish scrumptious dragon on a pedestal hugo conjured colored berries for himself and ivy he pre ferred yellow while she liked blue they all ate contentedly stanley was now cracking bone with his teeth as happy as he had ever been after that they exchanged stories ivy told how she had taken a walk with a zombie and a ride on a carpet and a tour with a yak and gotten so turned around she didnt know for sure which way was home hugo described how he had ac cidentally thrown youth water on his father and the gap dragon then run away when his father vanished until he met ivy and started traveling with her the two explained how they had joined the baby dragon whom they now knew to be the former gap dragon but who was stanley now and how they had fought off the bugbear and king fracto the cloud king cumulofractonimbus the cyclops demanded well i know and not like that airhead and he launched into his own story which naturally enough he called hisstory or simply history his name was brontes and he had once been one of the powers of the air along with his brothers steropes and arges they were some of the children of the sky and the earth and they forged thunderbolts for their father but the sky grew jealous of them and deprived them of their powers and ban ished them their mother earth gave them sanctuary in her realm but could not do more for she was not as strong as their father besides she liked the sky he gets tempestuous at times she had conceded but hes got such a nice blue eye besides i need the rain he sends so brontes had hidden here in this obscure cave for a long time afraid to go abroad by day because of the wrath of the sky and his power of thunder had been usurped by the self styled cloudking fracto who had originally been no more than minor fog brontes was alone more than anything he missed the company of his brothers but he did not know where they were and did not dare range too far from his cave lest he be caught in the open when day came and be destroyed by one of the very thunderbolts he had helped forge so long ago when he was young oh thats such a sad story ivy exclaimed weve got dragon on a pedestal to help you find your brothers she had a very tender heart because of the way she had been raised how you do that brontes asked interested but not unduly hopeful his brothers had been lost a long time theres something about her hugo said i never was very good with my fruits until she came along and dont think stanley was as hot with his steam all it takes is a positive attitude ivy said brightly pleased with her ability to turn a good phrase when i think maybe i can do something like talking well then i try it and find i can do it when hugo really tried to conjure good fruit then he did it and stanley was able to make hotter steam when he tried so maybe if you really tried to see where your brothers are you could do it ive tried to find them ever since we were banished brontes exclaimed why should it suddenly work now as usual ivy ignored what she couldnt answer it was a very effective device you have such a fine big eye im sure you can see very well with it why dont you look very well the cyclops agreed humoring her for she was an extremely cute child light was coming in the cave entrance and retouching her hair to a delicate green tint and her eyes were the same color brontes peered out of the cave into the forest beyond behind the trees the gully ascended so there really was not very much for anyone to view then he sat up straight i can see well he exclaimed i can seeright through the trees never do that before hes talking better too hugo noted you just never really really tried before ivy said con fidently she was used to the people she met underestimating their potentials brontes swung his gaze around i can see through the cave wall he said amazed through the mountain itself ive got yray vision hugos brow furrowed he had picked up smatterings of information relating to magic since that was his fathers busi ness i think you mean zray vision he said its hooray vision the cyclops said now i can see all dragon on a pedestal xanth he continued to swing his gaze around taking it all in and theretheres my brother steropes oh he looks so much older hes in a cave on the other side of this very mountain i never realized and argesin the next mountain over i guess we hunted in different directions so near and yet so far i just knew you could do it ivy said clapping her little hands with joy hugo looked out the cave mouth day is getting on he said wed better start moving if you wait till night i can carry you some distance brontes offered ivy considered no you must go to meet your brothers then we like the day the sky isnt out to get us well go now she smiled shyly but well always be friends wont we friends the cyclops agreed he fished in his uniform and dug out a slightly scorched little bone chew on this if you ever need me at night and i will hasten to help it is the one bit of magic i possess i never had occasion to use it beforebut i never had a friend before either gee thanks i will ivy said accepting the bone she knotted it into her somewhat tangled hair where it would not be lost for nothing was quite as permanent as a tangle now im a cave girl with that they parted the cyclops resuming his nap inside the cave and the three travelers resuming their journey north east progress was faster now for they were reasonably well rested and fed and the day was bright ivy looked up into the patches of blue sky visible beyond the trees privately surprised that anything so pretty would be so unkind to a nice creature like the cyclops but she realized she was too small to understand everything in xanth yet the forest seemed much less threatening than it had the night before however appearances in xanth were generally deceptive they rounded a treeand skidded to a pause a girl hugo exclaimed as if he had never seen one before it did seem to be a girl but though the size of the figure was between those of hugo and ivy she was no child she dragon on a pedestal was a petite dark lovely little woman as she spied them her hand moved to her hip and drew forth a brightly gleaming knife stay away from me monster she cried ivy realized what the problem was thats stanley she said hes my friend hes a dragon the small woman pointed out hes the baby gap dragon hugo explained the gap dragon the womans terror increased i thought he looked familiar she backed away knife held ready ivy knew that most women were clumsy with weapons but this one evidently knew how to use hers maybe it was because she was so stunningly pretty despite her somewhat bedraggled condition ivys mother had impressed upon her that pretty girls needed to be able to defend themselves oh come on ivy said if he doesnt bite me why should he bite you youre a people she patted stanley on the head the gap dragon eats anything especially people the woman said anyway im not a people im a goblin girl ivys brow wrinkled but goblins are ugly not the girls hugo said my father says the goblin girls are pretty and he knows just about everything so it must be true only the good magician knows everything the woman asserted thats what i said she looked at him again startled yes the goblin girls are pretty and the goblin men are ugly she agreed after a mo ment thats one reason i deserted my tribe to seek romance are you quite sure the dragon wont bite ivy turned to stanley do you bite goblin girls the dragon puffed steam noncommittal ly seehes not hungry anyway ivy said hes had a good meal of griffin bone and she shrugged not remembering whether stanley had eaten any fruit this time the woman relaxed slightly a good meal then she stiffened again that dragon killed a griffin ivy laughed oh no it was carrion the cyclops gave him after stanley steamed his eye dragon on a pedestal the cyclops the woman cried almost tripping in her effort to retreat farther you misunderstand hugo said we are friends with the cyclops but he never leaves his cave by day again the woman relaxed you are unusual people she brushed her fine tresses away from her face oh im fam ished famshed ivy asked perplexed hungry im about to pass out on my feet hugo conjured a handful of raspberries we have lots of fruit i really havent eaten since yesterday the woman ex claimed as if this were highly significant news there was a certain flair in the way she spoke it was part of her beauty sit down and eat and tell us your story ivy invited her im ivy and this is hugo the goblin girl accepted the raspberries and sat delicately on a mossy stone im glory daughter of gorbage chief of the northslope gap goblins my story is very poignant hugo and ivy were perplexed now what kind of ant ivy asked glory smiled briefly as she chewed on a raspberry whose juice was no darker than her lips poignant it means piquant another kind of ant ivy asked we did see some giants in the coventree the woman frowned still looking quite pretty i meant to say sad she clarified pointed and sad oh ivy said but i dont like sad stories couldnt you make it happy possibly it will have a happy ending glory said oh goody and ivy settled back to listen while hugo conjured more fruit for their new acquaintance chapter dread seeds irene was beset by doubt first she worried that they would drop the bag of seeds in the course of the frequent passings back and forth when that didnt happen she was concerned that she would misplace her grip and fall herself in between she was nervous about the impression she was making on those below climbing down the vine in her blouse and green panties at age fifteen she would have loved the excuse now it bothered her considerably she wasnt certain whether it would be worse to have people admiring her exposed legs and whateveror to have people condemning them she had tried to keep trim and firm but they made it safely xap and chem and zora were waiting together with several of the muses as soon as she and the seeds were safely down irene grew a dress plant and a new pair of ladyslippers then clothed herself properly but her worries were only replaced by others where was ivy now had the cyclops eaten her no of course not the little ivy plantwhat a contrast between the one she wore and the one she had climbedremained healthy but it would still take at least a day to get back unless she grew another flying plant and flew back chem wouldnt be able to come along then or zora zombie and she needed these friends also none of her flying plants could handle the additional burden of the big bag of seeds better to ride back as they had ridden in though the loss of time chafed suppose they encountered the python again or the maen ads there were so many hazards between her and her child dragon on a pedestal irene got a grip on herself and checked her big new bag of seeds she picked out several familiar ones and several unfa miliar ones just in case she had used up so many of her regular seeds that she could no longer depend on them the muses were friendly civilized intelligent women and irene would have loved to visit with them but she had no time for chitchat any delay could be horrendous for ivy as it was there might not be enough time everything was so uncertain lets get moving she snapped the others looked askance at her but didnt argue they bade hasty farewell to the muses and set off down the best path still irene was agitated suppose chem stumbled and broke a leg so many things could go wrong grundy looked back at her anything wrong irene the golem asked you looked scared shut up you little rag blob she snapped he only asked if chem started you too animal rump irene said hurt the centaur was silent irene had never before ad dressed her in such manner and the language was undeserved the seeds xavier exclaimed the big bird said to re member what they were suddenly it connected doubt dissension and war irene exclaimed ive been doubting ever since i got them that isnt all grundy muttered sullenly irene realized that it wasnt enough just to know the cause of her problem she had to find a way to eliminate the bad effects of the seeds we can carry them xavier said helpfully pass them out one to a person so it wont be too bad for none of us despite her doubt irritation and growing inclination for violence irene saw the merit in the suggestion the lout was actually pretty smart she handed the seed of doubt to grundy the seed of dissension to xavier and the seed of war to zora she didnt want the two steeds to have them they were too important for transportation and xap would be too dangerous if he developed warlike notions dragon on a pedestal irene felt immediate relief as the seeds left her confidence and equilibrium returned they would make it lot of bad things on the way grundy said maybe we should take another route that was the seed of doubt it helped to know that she could ignore the golem come on xap get your gait straight xavier said irrita bly youre bouncing us all over the place you birdbeak dont let the seed of dissension govern you irene warned having felt its effect herself so recently shut your yap you middleaged broad he snapped at her irene felt the color cruising up her neck and face she knew the cause of his language but it was all she could do to hold her tongue she looked apprehensively at the zombie who now rode behind xavier again zora seemed as sanguine as only a zombie could be despite the fact that zombies had very little blood apparently the seeds did not affect the undead give your seeds to zora irene called she can handle them at least irene hoped so it was done the problem seemed to be solved one thing irene now realizedthe three dread seeds would do xanthippe little good that must be why the simurgh had decided to send them to the witch with the seeds under control and the route known the trav elers should be able to make good progress back to the region where ivy was lost irene began to feel faintly confident with luck luck was not with them the python lay coiled in their path the huge snake was bruised and had patches of skin missing but had survived the onslaught of the wild women the deadly head lifted and the huge jaws gaped we aint off parnassus yet xavier muttered quickly irene fetched out her new dragon seed and threw it down before the python grow she cried the seed sprouted vigorouslybut something happened to irenes head she put her hand to her hairand discovered plants growing there she had missed three seeds hidden in her hair and her command had started them off normally only dragon on a pedestal the seed she directed her attention to grew which was why the big bag of seeds wasnt sprouting but there was some peripheral effect and seeds actually in contact with her body could also be set off though at a slower rate she was starting a garden in her hair worse there was another seed hidden in her bosom it must have fallen there during the original spray from the tree it was growing inside her blouse curling around an unmention able area she plunged her hand down her neckline fishing for the plant what a place this is a sneering voice exclaimed from inside her dress are these mountains pyramids or bags of sand worse and worse that was a devils tongue plant she had to catch it and get it out before the others noticed ive heard of cushy locations the tongue said slurping around some more but this is entirely too much of a good thing i cant get my roots properly grounded in all this cheese cake irene finally got her fingers on the tongue it was slimy and slippery but she yanked it out the thing flapped about in her hand but could not get free what you got there xavier inquired glancing at her whats it to you you son of a witch the devils tongue demanded irene hastily threw it away it landed in an elephant bush which trumpeted angrily oh go pack in your trunk the tongue said now grundy looked at her hey youve fixed up your hair irene touched her hair again the tongue had distracted her but now these other three plants were the main concern she identified each by touch a centipede plant a fiery love flower and a birdsnest fern the python hissed and slid forward tired of waiting for this party to get moving the halfgrown dragon tree snapped at it her hair would have to wait a little longer xap reared and charged eager for the fray irene grabbed another seedthis one for a snowball plant grow she told it and tossed it into the pythons opening dragon on a pedestal mouth the reptile naturally enough swallowed the sprouting seed for an instant nothing happened the plant was still growing then the huge serpent became cold a segment of its body turned blue the mouth opened again and freezing fog came out icicles formed on the upper teeth the dragon tree pounced on the frigid snake but found only ice it would be a while before the creature thawed xap and chem trotted past unmolested one hazard was out of the way but already the next hazard manifested the maenads who it seemed were still pursuing the python swarmed up the path blood was in their eyes and on their claws probably some of it was their own for several were limping but they remained as vicious as ever irene fished for a suitable seed she had an african violent that she wouldnt have used on any man but these wild women were another matter she grabbed it and threw it forward grow the seed sprouted in air sending out greenbacked foliage and silvery stalks gold disks fruited gleaming in the sunlight brightly shining stones appeared decorating the vines the maenads shrieked and pounced on the fruit they plucked the golden coins and hurled them at the oncoming party they tossed the greenbacks in the air what kind of plant is that grundy asked irene looked more closely and groaned she had thrown the wrong seed thats a treasure vine these creatures of parnassus sure like money the golem remarked look at them play with it indeed the wild women were throwing the bills and coins around as if they were splashing water they formed piles of money and reveled in them they fought over particular bills with big figures printed on them it seemed women were partial to that kind but those who had not amassed enough of a fortune were turning again toward the visiting party their predatory eyes glinting irene knew there was nothing quite so dangerous as a hungry wild woman she got her fingers on the correct seed and threw it grow violent she cried dragon on a pedestal the plant obeyed with alacrity purple clubs appeared smashing at anything in reach ow a wild woman screamed as a club clobbered her toe she danced away on one foot oof anothercried as another club whomped her bottom hooo a third screeched sailing into the air and a club sprouted right underneath her you sure fight mean xavier said admiringly as they skirted the melee and went on down the mountain and you thought women were gentle grundy reminded him snidely xavier looked nonplused well the centaur filly here is xap made a squawk of negation tinged with humor and chem blushed it seemed there were some aspects of centaur private life that were sensitive startled xavier shifted his statement a mighty healthy one he concluded with that both hippogryph and centaur were satisfied irene nodded to herself that must have been some night exploration those two mixbreeds had xavier brightened zora he exclaimed shes gentle she dont have a violent bone in her body all her bones are rotten grundy agreed its easy to be gentle when youre dead undead irene said coming to zoras defense thats not the same it occurred to her that even zora had not seemed gentle when she faced down the furies and drove them away but that was not an issue she cared to argue she owed too much to the zombie i agree zora is a nice girl if you like that type grundy muttered she sure helped us xavier said right now shes car rying the bad seeds for us if she had any doubt dissension or war in her shed be a zombie tigress by now yes thats right the golem agreed glancing across at zora irene glanced too to see how the zombie was taking this discussion zora seemed blissfully unconcerned in fact she even looked healthier her flesh now seemed more soiled than decayed all the features of her face were in place and her hair swung as if recently cleaned and brushed with only a few patches missing dragon on a pedestal but some zombies are violent chem remarked during the war of the nextwave the zombies fought like maniacs she seemed happy to have the subject be zora instead of herself so it must be zora who is peaceful even the furies remarked on it she must have been awfully nice when she lived it hadnt actually been peacefulness that the furies had re marked on irene remembered but zoras loyalty to her par ents chem was only going by what irene and the others had talked about since she herself hadnt been there at the time it was a minor misunderstanding and the heel who caused her to suicide must have been an unutterable slob irene con cluded with some feeling she suicided xavier asked surprised heartbreak irene told him her true love was false xavier scowled you know i never zapped a living man guess thats one i would a mans got no business making no commitment he dont keep ever again irene was impressed with the young mans crudely expressed values she herself had absolutely no romantic in terest in him but she could appreciate that if she had that interest would not be misplaced xavier was true to his values and they were decent ones no woman would commit suicide because of him zora riding behind him still said nothing irene realized with another surge of shame that all of them continued to treat the zombie like an unfeeling thing what almost made it worse was that none of them did it intentionally it just was very easy to treat a zombie like a zombie a thing i wonder what misfortunes shes cursed with xavier said after a moment the furies curses which she saved us from either they havent affected her any more than the three bad seeds do irene said or they havent occurred yet weve had some close calls but nothings happened to her its really too bad about those curses xavier said i should have taken my own like a man irene found she could neither agree nor argue with that so she let it pass without comment after all she also had been spared the curse of misfortune because of zoras intercession it was possible that a misfortune that would kill irene would dragon on a pedestal have little or no effect on zorabut it was also possible that it would be equally devastating for human or zombie she simply didnt know so didnt know how to feel she owed so much to zora and had no idea how she could ever repay it once it had been possible to restore a zombie to life but only two people had known the formula for the necessary elixir the zombie master and the good magician the zombie master had forgotten it in the course of his own eight hundred years as a zombie the information had probably been in one of the portions of his brain that got sloughed away the good ma gician was now hopeless so there was no such reward possible for zoraand if there had been she would not have wanted it since she had no reason to live irene tried to imagine a greater tragedy than that but could not why was it that some times the best people suffered the worst fates was there no inherent justice in xanth despite all its magic they reached the base of the mountain and crossed the rolling creekbed this time irene took the precaution of growing an action plant which sent its roots throughout the bed and caused all the loose stones to vibrate and roll any snakes or other dangerous or annoying creatures would depart in haste crossing was now no problem all they had to do was set their feet where nothing was active because the action plant guar anteed that anything that could move was already doing so now they were in a more normal region of xanth and moved rapidly irene was glad to leave parnassus behind it was no place for civilized mortal creatures except perhaps at the top xap remained on the ground running beside chem it was evident that the hippogryphs squawked comment about un gentle centaurs had been a compliment not an insult he liked her very well in gratifyingly short order they were back where they had made camp last night it was now late in the day but they didnt want to sleep in this particular spot they had hardly passed it before they heard the screaming of the three furies we sure dont need this again xavier said grimly they were right about me and mawill give the old crones that but ill take care of it my own way without no other lesson irene agreed remembering her own guilt about her mother dragon on a pedestal im not sure the furies are strictly fair about their charges she said or their curses if soi mean if theyre more interested in cursing and hurting people than in improving their behaviorthen they are to some extent hypocrites it happens i have a seed that should stop them she located it and held it ready just charge on by when you see them the three furies appeared irene nudged chem with her knee and the centaur swerved toward the dogfaced trio ho you vile equine tisi cried spreading her wingcloak threateningly does your dam cherie know what you have been doing with irene threw down the seed grow she cried the seed sprouted before the three hags whats this alee cried alarmed argh meg screamed i know that one tis an honesty plant so how have you three harridans treated your mothers irene called back thats awkward chem said the furies never had a mother they sprang from the blood of their murdered father thats why theyre so concerned with the furies were appalled as they came into the spell of the honesty plant ah oh one screamed in truth we have neglected our sires grave we were so busy punishing the sins of others we neglected our own another agreed and we must pay the third cried waving her brass studded scourge ooo what you did grundy said happily theyll have to flog and curse themselves honesty does awkward things to people irene remarked smugly yet im sorry if they never knew a mother it was she found difficult to condemn anyone once that persons situation was understood the furies too were creatures of tragedy they left the furies behind then found a secure place near a pleasant stream and made their camp irene grew a chain fem around the perimeter so that any intruder would trip over it and set the sweetbells plants to ringing a warning then she dragon on a pedestal grew several food plants for them to eat and a blanket plant from which to make beds she didnt worry about protecting herself from xavier during her sleep she now understood his nature well enough to know that he took seriously the warning of the simurgh not to mess with a spokenfor woman he would turn his attention elsewhere as soon as this mission for his mother was complete and whatever girl he found would be fortunate how she wished she were back with her husband dor who was surely quite worried about her but he could if he thought of it get hold of a magic mirror that would show him she was all right too bad she thought as she wound her way toward a troubled sleep that dor could not similarly verify exactly where ivy was good magician humfrey had been able to tune the mirrors on to anyone or anything but they would not obey other people as readily there was a mirror at castle roogna that would show either dor or irene whoever happened to be away from the castle but no one else they had assumed that ivy would always be with one parent or the otherindeed she always had been before or at least within calling range so they had not worried about tuning to her separately that could have made an enormous difference this time but at least the little ivy plant irene carried offered its continuing assurance without that she would have been driven to distraction long they resumed travel at dawn eating halfway on the run irene just wanted to deliver the three seeds and the feather to xanthippe return xavier and xap to her and get on with the business of locating and rescuing ivy they had been lucky so far that nothing serious had happened to any of them but luck was a fickle ally they were not far from the witchs house when they spied a lovely small springfed pond and drew up for refreshment irene dismounted in order to use the nearby bushes for a private function while xap xavier and zora went to the sparkling pond the hippogryph put down his beak and scooped in a mouth dragon on a pedestal ful of the clear water raising his head to let it trickle down his throat birdfashion he glanced across at chem making a flick of the wing to invite her to join him but she was waiting for irene helping to shield her from the view of the males if xap says the waters good its good xavier said cheer fully not that there was any question you can see how green it is around here no dragons in this spring he flopped down on the bank and put his mouth to the surface manfashion zora beside him tripped over a rock and plunged headlong into the pool hey xavier exclaimed scooting back to avoid the splash i meant to drink it not swim in it he was smiling goodnaturedly zora got awkwardly to her feet and trudged out of the shal low water her sunken eyes seemed to glow as she gazed at xavier theres something odd about her grundy remarked do zombies glow maybe when theyre in love irene said facetiously as she emerged from the bush she would have been embarrassed too if she had fallen in the pond love chem asked you know some springs dont drink that water xav grundy shouted xavier paused his mouth just above the surface of the pool why not i dont care if she took a dip it was just her bad luck because it may be a love spring irene said look at zora indeed zora was gazing at the young man with such mute adoration that no one could any longer mistake her transfor mation it was the nature of love springs to cause anyone who drank from them to fall hopelessly in love with the first creature of the opposite sex he or she perceived thereafter if the victim already loved someone else the new love was superimposed that person then had two loves the most recent one being the stronger love springs accounted for most of the crossbreed species of xanth and there were many funny and tragic tales of this the effect of a love spring could not be changed by lining up some more promising prospect and taking another drink in his or her presence that would only add yet another dragon on a pedettol love to the collection making the situation even more difficult like death love was practically irrevocable the misfortune xavier exclaimed in horror the curse that was meant for me she got it instead that made sense irene realized obviously the curse of the furies had been slated for xavier he had been poised to drink and only the zombies accident had brought it on herself instead this could have been considered coincidencebut the curse eliminated that explanation what worse misfortune could there be for a zombie chem murmured than to fall in love with a living man what indeed especially a zombie who had suicided be cause of blighted love zoras love for the other man might have faded after she died but that only left her more vulnerable to this new love maybe she could go to mundania grundy said but irene knew immediately that that was no solution it was true that magic did not work in mundaniathat land was extremely backward that way and she often wondered how the inhabitants could stand itso that any spell could be broken there but zora was not a normal person she was a zombie animated only by magic she would be alltheway dead in mundania so she was caught between hopeless love and death and doomed to eternal heartbreak those furies didnt mess around chem said they could hardly have inflicted a cruder punishment on a more innocent person no one could argue with that they had agreed that zora was the nicest of them all already suffering unfairlyand now her grief had been intensified beyond reason but they intended the curse for me xavier repeated for me to fall in love with a zombie the horror of that intended fate was now coming home to him we should never have gone near the furies irene said their punishments really do make people wish they were deadperhaps even when they are already dead but the waters supposed to be good xavier said quer ulously xap wasnt affected by it how about that grundy agreed ill ask him dragon on a pedestal the golem squawked at the hippogryph xap responded grundy laughed whats so funny irene demanded shaken by what had happened compelled love was certainly no laughing matter suppose she herself had it didnt affect xap because the first female he saw was chem grundy explained and he was already in love with her chem smiled a little sadly of course irene understood the centaurs problem xap was one fine animalbut he was an animal chem was half human she might dally with an animal and even seek offspring by him centaurs were notoriously open about such things in contrast to straight human conventions but love marriage that was a more substantial matter males could fall in love readily because their lives were not so much affected by it they did not have to bear the offspring females were more careful because their necessary commitment was greater chem would have to handle this in her own fashion and was surely competent to do so as most women were zora however was not competent she had not been al lowed to make her considered choice an impossible love had been imposed on her irene didnt know any good way out of that she had learned that zombies did have feelings from her association with zora but when zora had already suicided once for love what remained for her one curse to go grundy said irene wished he hadnt reminded her zora had absorbed two curses of misfortune one for xavier the other for irene herself now they knew these curses did act on the zombie what additional tragedy was slated for irenethat zora would inherit how could things possibly get worse for zora than they were now irene felt the sickening certainty that they would soon find out the curse of unrequited love was now on xav iers conscience thought it was not his fault the next one would be on irenes conscience make sure zora understands what happened and why chem told grundy drogon on a pedestal she understands the golem said she sort of liked xav anyway hes a decent man you know i know irene agreed xavier was a much better man than one would have expected the son of a witch to be perhaps because he did not let his mother influence him unduly he preferred to go flyingand that perhaps had been his chief defense against corruption the furies had criticized him for neglect of his mother but he was probably correct in that neglect some mothers did not deserve to be honored too much again irene reacted to what had happened the furies had planned to force xavier into love with a zombie the sheer evil of it appalled her now she was the one remaining to be cursed and she knew it would be terrible all out of proportion to her errorand that it would fall again on zora there was no way to view it that offered any positive aspect they moved on but now zora rode behind irene the others tacitly agreed that the zombie should not be with xavier who could only be embarrassed by her presence they came to a region they hadnt seen before because a number of stone figures decorated it perplexed chem proj ected her map nothis is on our route i thought i remem bered it see my map shows us right on the dotted line these statues werent here before could be the work of maw xavier said she collects strange animals and plants she never collected no statues be fore but she might start these are very finely wrought likenesses chem re marked look there are even a number of insects she picked one up and held it in the sunlight it was a henroach with every leg and two fine antennae perfectly sculptured in stone a very fine artisan made this the elves maybe grundy suggested some of them are quite skilled i can ask around irene spotted a figure walking ahead of them it looked familiar it was a tall rather voluptuous woman i think i have another answer she said nudging chem to trot closer the woman apparently did not hear them when they were quite close irene called hey gorgon slowly the figure turned chem suddenly balked and irene dragon on a pedestal had to hold on to keep her seat zora less able to react started to fall irene grabbed her looking down the zombie stiffened her flesh congealing close your eyes chem cried shes not veiled irenes eyes snapped closed before she raised her head gorgon she cried its i irene put on your veil why the gorgon asked because otherwise youll turn us all to stone thats right will the gorgon agreed sounding sur prised of course you will irene snapped shaken by her near escape she had assumedbut assuming could be treacherous as the episode at the love spring had so recently shown why werent you wearing your veil you know you cant go around barefaced forgot the gorgon said as if remembering something that might have been important a long time ago very well im veiled now irene pried open one eye though uncertain whether this would protect her if she saw the gorgons face maybe only half of her would turn to stone but it was all right now her friend was safely covered how could you forget a thing like that irene demanded still shaken well i was just walking along looking for something i dont remember whatwhenits all unclear didnt re member you until a forgetwhorl chem exclaimed were back in their region she got tagged by and forgot her mission irene agreed my mission the gorgon asked perplexed to find and rescue your son hugo the gorgons mouth gaped under the veil hugo and we forgot we were back among the rampaging whorls chem said between her forced forgetting and our careless ness we almost came to considerable grief but her forget fulness doesnt seem total because her memory is coming back as we remind her a glancing blow irene agreed she must have brushed dragon on a pedestal the fringe of it not getting a full dose but the encounter was potentially deadly to us i very nearly was turned to she broke off remembering the zombie behind her zora had looked into the face of the gorgon zora took your curse chem said she has xavier and grundy rode up lucky you werent stoned the golem remarked i told xav and xap to stay clear when i saw what was up zora looked irene said dully she suffered the misfor tune slated for me xavier jumped down and lifted the zombie away from chems side where she was half hanging she cant be dead he cried she wasnt alive the seeds of mischief sown by the furies are deadly chem murmured we sought to avoid their curses but only transferred them to the most innocent one among us the centaur was being kind she had not been present so she shared none of the blame but the damage had been done wake zora xavier exclaimed holding the stiff zombie upright you dont deserve none of this you never harmed nobody yet there is a philosophical alignment chem continued xaviers curse and irenes curselove and deathvisited on the same person the only cure for the one is the other zora isnt suffering now the hell with that xavier cried i wont let her die not after what she done for me zora come back and he took the zombie statue in his arms and kissed her on the mouth the others watched saddened yet fatalistic knowing that the man meant well but that the woman was doomedand had been doomed from the time she absorbed the curses the terrible furies had had their way then something amazing happened the statue began to sag irene stared stone couldnt sag even zombie stone crum bled or flaked away it didnt really soften xavier was still kissing her holding her against him the vital warmth of his body was almost tangible and zora was returning to her halflife dragon on a pedestal look at that gmndy said the gorgon cant stone zom bies chem turned her human segment so her eyes could meet irenes gaze perhaps it is true zora was immune to the stare of the python she cant see very well so perhaps it is like a veil between her and visual magic she may have suffered only partial petrificationand she was not as solid as we to begin with but therethere is a rationale irene whispered numbly if you were stone or mostly stone and the man you loved embraced you and kissed you and begged you to returnwould you respond irene thought of herself becoming stone and her husband dor kissing her i supposeif there were any wayany way at all irene agreed faintly love has power we hardly understand xavier broke the kiss i told you i wouldnt let her die he said zora was flesh again she stood stiffly blinking as if her eyelids were heavy her body had been too loose before now it was too firm but she was more flesh than stone they could not argue with xaviers claim though irene was uncertain which explanation had more to do with it the gor gons face turned living people to stonebut a zombie was undead a different matter yet some things did affect zombies as they had seen but what have you restored her to chem asked a hopeless love xavier released zora who stood without difficulty looking about her she seemed more solid now as if the gorgons magic had stiffened her decaying flesh to healthy flesh she appeared more alive than she had ever been ironically ive been thinking about that xavier said about the good things shes been doing for us all im not awful smart about women but it sure seems to me a good zombie is better than a bad woman this one is awful goodand youd hardly know shes a zombie now it was true zora was still firming love andor the gorgons dragon on a pedestal magic had transformed her to something considerably more human than before her facial features had become both clear and animate her body strong she was indeed a woman and not an unattractive one but you irene protested weakly you dont love i know where the love spring is xavier said i know whats right nothing to stop me from taking a drinki was going to do that before its supposed to be my curse anyway i never was one to let someone else pay my debts irenes respect for him increased again xavier had a con science and a rather clear notion of what was required he had decided to honor his mothers wish that he settle down and he had chosen the one to settle with this was a strange and unexpected unionbut it did make a certain sense and it nicely reversed the double curse zora had absorbed good luck she whispered xavier turned to zora do you like to fly he asked i do she said clearly her teeth showed as hard and clear as polished stone when she smiled thats a most artistic proposal chem murmured xavier lifted zora to xavs back it was evident she weighed more than she had but his strength more than sufficed then he mounted the hippogryph behind her putting his arms about her well take the seeds to maw he told irene zoras carrying em anyway and ive got the feather you folks can go on about your business thank you irene breathed still dazed the hippogryph spread his beautiful wings we shall meet again chem told xap xap nodded his beak then pumped he rose into the air facing back toward the love spring your mother wont like this grundy called after them thats for sure xavier called back grinning but she cant stop me from being a dutiful son they disappeared into the sky nothing more needed to be said irene felt tears in her eyes and they were not those of grief chapter glory goblin c i am the youngest and prettiest and sweetest daugh ter of gorbage goblin chief of the gapside goblins glory repeated as she delicately chewed on the blackberries gray berries brownberries guavas and sugarplums hugo conjured for her appetite i am in love with a wonderful creature lovethats poinant or peekant ivy asked wonderfully sad glory said firmly love isnt sad ivy said thinking of her family she was glad for this chance to rest since she wasnt used to walking the long distances she had covered in the past two days my father says love is fun and my mother says it depends on the time of day glory smiled they surely know but you see this is for bidden love that makes it sad how can love be forbidden hugo asked my father says anything is possible with magic except maybe paradox and hes working on that what is possible is not necessarily permissible glory said love really shouldnt be forbidden but after all hes not a goblin she bit into some more fruit it was evident that when the goblin girl said famished she meant very hungry indeed well my father says goblins are related to elves gnomes and dwarves hugo said theyre of modified humanoid stock he says so they can interbreed if they want to and when they run afoul of a love spring thats true glory said any two species can interbreed dragon on a pedestal in xanth but this is generally not voluntary even if the in dividuals approve others of their kinds do not and some liaisons are expressly forbidden i love a harpy both children gazed at her blankly glory sighed i see ill have to explain the goblins and harpies are enemies the enmity goes back over a thousand years you must be older than you look ivy said perplexed glory smiled again she was extremely pretty to begin with and when she smiled the forest seemed to brighten no im only sixteen i mean the quarrel is ancient ivys brow wrinkled my father said something about a war a long time ago he was there when they were building castle roogna a spell glory frowned delicately you really shouldnt fib ivy you know he couldnt have been there well he was in the tapestry with this big spider oh you mean he watched it on the magic tapestry in castle roogna i have heard about that and would love to see it someday i watch it all the time ivy said but i fall asleep before it gets interesting i gather your father works at castle roogna yes most of the time glory shrugged not really interested well once goblins and harpies existed in peace they even shared caves the goblins used the floors and the harpies used the ceiling perches but in time it got crowded and the goblins complained about the droppings you see goblins sleep with their mouths open so they can snore properly and she shrugged again she did it very well the harpies got angry and put a curse on our males making them uglywell really it was on the females making them prefer ugly goblins i understand it is much easier to apply a curse of perception than one of actual physical changethats why illusion is so popular anyway the girls stayed pretty but the goblin men owing to sexual selection ugh so the goblins got even for that by luring away all the harpy maleswho it seems were partial to fully fleshed legs dragon on a pedestal unlike the chicken legs of the harpy femalesuntil there were no males left and the harpies were all female now hugos brow wrinkled all female but how i dont know exactly how they reproduced maybe they laid parthenogenetic eggs what harpies hatch from eggs glory explained patiently if theres no male the eggs may hatch anywaybut only female chicks something like that im not much for parthenogenesis myself its not a type of magic i understand anyway they were all female and mostly old and ugly and bitter as perhaps they had a right to be they were absolutely furious at us though all the goblins had done was get even for what they had done to us so there was war all the goblins and our allies on the ground against all the harpies and their allies in the air in those days the goblins and harpies were the most numerous creatures in xanth and wielded the most power but after the battle there were not nearly so many of either and true human folk became dominant at least the curse was off and the goblin girls liked hand some males again and the harpies had a few males but the damage took a long time to clear because there werent any handsome male goblins left which made the girls understand ably reluctant there was only one harpy cock for every hundred or so hens and all the hens were ugly and dirty which made the cocks reluctant so in eight hundred years the numbers of goblins and harpies have hardly increased most goblin males are still ugly and so are the old harpy hens during that period they still fought one another in honor of old grudges but not so much because there were so fewand the gap chasm interfered stanley perked up his ears he remembered the gap how could the gap do that hugo asked no one even remembered it thats the point glory said its very hard to cross the gap when you dont remember it especially when theres a dragon in it who gobbles anyone who tries to pass so grad ually the goblins settled north of the gap the harpies settled dragon on a pedestal south of it and the warfare diminished it was really the gap that brought peace to xanth stanley snorted steam that swirled dangerously near her petite feet and the gap dragon glory added quickly stanley re laxed of course the harpies could fly over the gap so there were some skirmishesjust enough to keep the blood feud alivebut mostly it was pretty quiet for several centuries stanley might be satisfied having established the impor tance of his office to the welfare of xanth but ivy wasnt but youre across the gap now true but you see the forgetspell has been breaking up and anyway my tribe lives right at the brink of the gap so were partly immune to the spell i used to sit on the ledge and look down into the gap and watch the dragon charge by so big and awful i could see the steam wafting up in frightening clouds stanley puffed more steam contentedly he was getting to like this goblin maiden who certainly looked good enough to eat but recently i saw that the dragon was gone so knew i could cross glory peered at stanley is he really the gap dragon hes so small yes hugo said i dumped fountain of youth water on him and now hes a baby dragon hes our friend now i guess babies are nicer than monsters that must be true glory agreed my people have always been nervous about your human kind the fullsized folk but you children seem very nice she chewed some more fruit i guess everyones nice if you know the person ivy said i like just about everything i meet except maybe some clouds some clouds can be bothersome especially the ones that rain on my hairdo glory agreed you must have been raised in a loving household isnt everyone the goblin girl made her sad peekant smile again alas no my father is ugly and vicious like most goblin males and my mother was always afraid of him oh im not saying gorbage is a bad man he is after all my father its just his dragon on a pedestal way you see though we goblin girls now prefer handsome and gentle men they arent very good fighters and so they dont survive very well in our region gorbage is chief because he is violent and ruthless and tougher than other goblin men he has been a good provider but he just doesnt understand love when my older sister goldy came of age gorbage made a party of creatures escort her to the northern goblin tribes so she could trap a husband but a pretty girl doesnt have to trap a man ivy protested not one as pretty as you in goblinland she does unfortunately thats part of what dismays me about it and goldy is not as pretty as i am so it was that much harder for her how could gorbage make other creatures escort a goblin girl hugo asked he threatened to eat them if they didnt he would have too one was an ogre but the ogre had just fought the gap dragon stanley perked up again interested though it was evident he didnt remember this ivy wasnt certain whether this was because he had lost most of his memory when he lost his age or whether the gap dragon had fought so many other monsters that he simply couldnt remember this particular spat and the ogre had just climbed out of the gap lifting out a centaur and was very tired so he couldnt fight thats a very rare state for ogres but ogres eat people too hugo objected and they eat goblins and monsters and trees and dirt and everything he should have gobbled up a tasty goblin girl this was a funny ogre he was with five assorted young females so gorbage figured if the brute hadnt eaten them maybe he wouldnt eat goldy either it seemed like a good risk no worse than going into battle or harvesting tentacles from a tangle tree my father is very practical he sent my sister with them and it worked because later we had news through the grapevine that my mother grows neat grapevines ivy said some of them reach right to the top of the castle and we talk to the dragon on a pedestal grapes at each end and the sound travels back and forth just perfectly yes of course glory agreed slightly annoyed by the frequent interruptions we have vines that grow well into dragonland and from there they connect to some of the northern vines but often there is no complete connection be cause somewhere along the way some dragon has scorched out a section anyway we learned that goldy had snared a northern goblin chief and was moderately satisfied thats how most goblins marry but i am too romantic for my own good my sister is tough shes always able to do what is necessary not i i am more a creature of fantasy so when it came my turn to marry she broke off grimacing and such was her beauty that even that expression was impossibly cute i fell in love with a male who conformed more perfectly to my ideals the harpy hugo said showing his intelligence hardy harpy she said i was sitting one evening dan gling my feet over the brink of the gap chasm and thinking my silly thoughts when i saw this bird flying down below me only it wasnt a bird it was a harpy and i was afraid because those harpy hens have the foulest mouths you ever heard i put my hand on my knife in case it should attack me and i got ready to scream i hiked up my skirt so could run but there was something different about this one couldnt smell the normally foul odor so i lingered longer than i should have and suddenly realized that this harpy was young and clean and male i had never seen a male harpy before they remain rare and they dont go out much to mix with other creatures i was so amazed i just waited there marveling my skirt held high she hiked her skirt a little to illustrate her legs were as tonishingly shapely and he came and perched beside me and told me what pretty legs i had so of course i didnt run away then goblin mens legs arent prettytheyre all black and knobby and warpedand harpy hens legs are even worse i can certainly see how a harpy cock would be turned off by a harpy hens claws and he spoke the truth about my legs she glanced down at them appreciatively as well she might but werent his legs bird legs ivy asked yes of course but males dont need nice legs he had dragon on a pedestal such lovely wings and a handsome face and manly chest and he spoke with such gentleness and intelligence she shrugged after that he came to see me often there at the brink of the chasm and in due course we fell in but didnt you get hurt ivy asked horrified the gaps so deep fell in love the goblin girl continued blithely oh we knew it was wrong for goblins and harpies are at war and the war had started centuries ago because of just such liaisons as this but we were so right for each other we simply couldnt help it we wanted to marry but we knew we couldnt as long as i was bound to my tribe the goblins would tar and defeather hardy and then start mistreating him so we could do nothing and meanwhile my father was looking for a way to get me north so i could snag a goblin chief and live in moderate declining satisfaction like my sister i knew i had to escape then the gap dragon leftand here i am across the gap looking for my beloved i hope i find him soon if i do then that will be the happy ending i promised we might have to this story but the jungle is so big ivy pointed out how can you ever find him xanth is so huge so have discovered glory agreed my legs were made for looking at not for all this walking hardy doesnt even know im coming i just hurried across not knowing how long the dragon would be gone but if he doesnt know hugo said and you dont know where he is he said he lives near the mouth organ so i am looking for that but i fear i am lost i cant find it anywhere and ive searched interminably that sounded like a very long time indeed whats a mouth organ ivy asked glory blushed prettily im sure i wouldnt know and i hesitate to guess but ive got to find it hugo can figure it out ivy said hes smart hugo put on the spot cudgeled his memory my father has books of pictures of thingsmonsters and plantsand i think there was one of a mouth organ its a big plant or animal dragon on a pedestal or something and it plays big low notes you can hear for hours away then we can hear it ivy said excitedly we can find it for glory if were close enough and if its playing hugo said lets listen they listened but heard no notes of any size ivy refused to be discouraged stanley can hear it she declared hes got good dragon ears she turned to the little dragon tune in to the mouth organ stanley show us where it is but stanley wasnt paying attention he was sniffing the air as if trykig to identify something odd hey stanley ivy repeated imperiously listen for the mouth organ the little dragon perked up his ears and swiveled them about it was evident that he had not considered tuning in on something this way before but ivys presence and need made it feasible soon he caught a whiff of some sort of sound and pointed his snout at it east see i told you he could do it ivy said now well find it for you and everything will be just fine i certainly hope you are correct glory said uncertainly i just have to find hardy they walked east over hill and dale avoiding tangle trees and such it was a fair distance so they paused every so often to rest and snack the sun was now high in the sky trying to peer down to see what they were doing in due course they could hear the organ themselves pon derous vibrating authoritative notes that shook the very jungle with their power it does sound big ivy said and pressed eagerly on they rounded a large old tree and almost stumbled over a boy eating a bowl of polkadot custard pudding startled the boy jumped up spilling his custard the dots skidded around and rolled away glad to escape the fate intended for them the boy was absolutely furious his hair changed from yellow to raging red you he expostulated and changed into a huge hairy spider covered in red fuzz that was darkening dragon on a pedestal to black made the spider chittered and became a scraggly faun with black horns and hooves turning green me the faun cried and coverted to a man with the green head of a snake sspilll the snakehead hissed turning brown and became a small tan griffin my the griffin squawked and reddened into a raging ball of fire lunch the fire roared and yellow flames flared high oh this thing was angry hugo happened to be in the lead so he took the main heat im sorry he said i didnt see you i can conjure you some nice fruit to eat instead he conjured a huge and pretty pomegranate and held it out the fire shaped back into the boy you offer a lutin mere fruit you cretin he demanded dashing it from hugos hand he changed into a monstrous moth hovering angrily ill see you cocooned for this the moth fluttered ill drive you to the flame ill punish all of you oh i love puns ivy said punish me first stifle it in cotton you brat the moth bawled turning white ill fix you you shall never see xanth again but were in xanth hugo protested weakly you shall be blind the moth vanished and a monstrous eyeball replaced it the eye was white with ferocious blue veins crawling around it and a blazing red pupil at the front from that pupil came a pale yellow mist forming an expanding cloud blind blind blind the eye repeated speaking through the pupil do something ivy cried alarmed glory drew her knife and stepped toward the eye no not you ivy cried the mist will get you first stanley whomped forward blowing steam not you ei ther ivy gasped catching hold of his tail to hold him back i dont want you to be blind i mean hugo gee thanks hugo said appalled i dont want to be blind either conjure some fruit that will save us oh yes he conjured a pineapple no dummy that will spread the yellow all around some other way dragon on a pedestal hugo did not seem to react with the same pleasure to the endearment as she had but i cant yes you can ivy insisted the yeow was looming awfully hugo concentratedand had an inspiration a gourdfruit appeared in his hands look at this lutin he cried shoving it at the floating eyeball the eye looked involuntarily for that was its natureand saw the peephole and froze where it was in midair the yellow mist dissipated harmlessly hugo set the gourd down carefully and the eye tilted its gaze to watch its descent what is that glory asked perplexed a hypnogourd hugo said its a sort of fruit so i can conjure it but this is the first i ever got right i aimed the peephole at the lutin glory laughed relieved of course we have whole patches of such gourds in goblinland i just didnt recognize it out of context what a clever way to nullify the eye monster whats a hypnogourd ivy asked she was only three years old and had seen a great many plants but for some reason her mother had never grown one of the gourd plants for her so her education was not yet quite complete its a gourd with a peephole glory explained should have recognized it instantly anyone who peeks in the hole is hypnotized until someone moves the gourd away or cuts off his line of sight its a good fairly harmless way to restrain a violent creature though it isnt wise to leave anyone hypnotized too long if you dont want it to be permanent lets get out of here before something happens to free the lutin hugo said nervously a leaf could fall and cover the peephole or an animal could roll the gourd over hell be awful mad when he gets free the others agreed they had never before encountered such a bad temper as that shown by this magical creature they hurried on leaving the veined eye and the gourd behind i thought each person had only one magic talent ivy remarked thoughtfully they do dear glory said goblins dont even have one such talent dragon on o pedestal but that lutin could change shape and do magiche was going to blind us thats right hugo agreed how could he do that maybe he was bluffing about the blindness glory said uncertainly he sure didnt sound as if he were bluffing hugo said he might have had some kind of herb or maybe some juice from a blindworm to make us blind anyway im glad you stopped him hugo glory said that was most intelligent and you have a very useful talent hugo flushed with guilty pleasure he wasnt used to such compliments especially from anyone as pretty as the goblin girl the organ notes became louder until their booming was fairly deafening there were many tones audible now low ones and high ones weaving in and out and around and through each other forming a tapestry of sound the effect was oddly moving stirring subterranean emotions of pleasure worry and guilt it was amazing what sheer sound could do i wonder whether it knows how to play romantic music glory murmured why ivy asked never mind dear it was an idle thought but there was something about the way she said it that gave ivy the impression it wasnt entirely idle stanley looked around again sniffing questing for some thing he couldnt quite pinpoint keep your mind on your business ivy chided the dragon at last they came in sight of the mouth organ this was a structure the size of a tree made up of mouths tremendous roomy toothy ugly ogrish mouths blasted out the huge low notes while smaller animalish mouths issued the middlesized central notes and tiny pursed ladylike mouths shrilled forth the small highest notes a figure appeared in the sky it was a harpy it cried a command and suddenly the mouth organ silenced deafen ingly ivy almost fell over she had been bracing against the sound and now there was none dragon on o pedestal the harpy swooped toward them it was male with beautiful wings and the handsomest face ivy had ever seen glory the harpy cried hardy the goblin girl cried joyously he flew down to her wrapped his wings about her like the folds of a cloak and kissed her the two were of about the same mass but differently structured yet it did not seem strange at all that they should be in love for each seemed more attractive than the other after a moment the harpy drew back and hovered in air his wings flapping with easy power who are these these are my friends who helped me find you glory explained ivy and hugo and stanley hardy harpy squinted at them they appear young we are hugo said thats the best way to be the dragon looks somehow familiar hes the baby gap dragon glory explained quickly but hes friendly now he tuned in on the mouth organ notes so i could find you must be all right then hardy said i had noticed the gap was oddly quiet recently but why are you here glory if i had known you were coming i would have flown to meet you as it was i worried at your absence from the gapside ledge i feared you had fallen in but i found no he broke off not wanting to utter such a horror i saw the gap was empty so i hurried across glory explained i was terrified i didnt know the dragon had been youthened it was my chance to get away from my father before he made me marry some hideous and brutal knobby kneed goblin chief but you took such a risk coming here hardy protested there are so many dangersdragons griffins even a bad tempered lutin weve met if anything had happened to you i just had to come glory said it was my only chance for happiness true the handsome harpy agreed come to my perch not far distant and bring your friends i will reward them with dragon on a pedestal some pretty trinkets i snatched from a dragons nest then later ill tune the mouth organ to play something roman tic yes glory breathed now ivy began to catch on to what that meant kissing must be more fun to music hardy led the way through the forest flying low and slow so they could readily follow a pleasant masculine aroma wafted out from his wings quite different from the normal harpy hen stench suddenly a net flew through the air and settled over them all before they understood what was happening the five of them were bundled up in an awkward ball stanleys green tail was in ivys face and she was standing on one of hardys wings and glory was sitting on hugos head hideous little men were charging from all sides brandishing clubs now weve got you one man yelled father glory screamed chagrined stanley blew out steam but this only made hardy jump the dragons snoot was aimed inward instead of outward so he couldnt steam the attackers now ivy recognized the creatures they were male goblins each was so dusky as to be almost black with a huge head big flat feet a bumpy round body and a horrendous scowl what were they doing here south of the gap that was answered directly by the goblin chief now weve got the criminal harpy gorbage exclaimed grimacing in what was evidently supposed to be a smile of victory thats redundant another goblin said all harpies are criminals there was coarse general laughter yes birds of a foul feather gorbage agreed and well hang him a third goblin said making a sugges tive gesture of yanking up a rope and sticking out his purple tongue as if choking naw hed just fly away another said well stab him and he made a gesture with a mock knife as of guts being punctured better to club him to tar and feathers dragon on o pedestal forcefeed him poisonberries weight him down and toss him into a bottomless pond they crowded around leering barraging him with horrible suggestions each one worse than the others oh hardy glory cried its my tribe they must have followed me i didnt know suddenly ivy realized what stanley had been sniffing for the goblins had been following glory and the party all the timenot close enough for the dragon to identify them for sure but still he had been aware of something if only she had paid more attention instead of chiding stanley for not sticking strictly to the mouth organ scent she could have asked the dragon what was bothering him and had him tune in to it specifically maybe they could have spotted the goblins and arranged to avoid them certainly they could have saved hardy harpy from this treachery now they were all in trouble at age three ivy did not have much experience with the cunning of angry creatures but she was learning first we must put this carrion on trial gorbage said we must make an example of him so the rest of the birdbrains will know not to fool with goblins they untangled the captives one at a time tying hugo and ivy with lengths of vine wrapping stanley securely in the net so he could hardly even wiggle and knotting rope around the legs of hardy and anchoring him to a stake pounded into the ground so that he could perch but not fly they left glory free she was after all only a goblin girl pretty but helpless now we gotta do this right gorbage said we gotta have a juryrigged verdict before we croak him who wants to be the jury all the goblin hands went up there were about a dozen of them each one uglier than his fellows and more eager to do the dirty work good enough youre the jury gorbage said and im the judge but thats not fair glory protested shut up gorbage told her mildly and she was silent it was difficult for her to oppose her father dragon on a pedestal do something hugo ivy whispered youre smart you can think of something to save our friends hugo was pale and frightened he had perhaps a better idea than she did of how much was at stake here notions of extreme violence tended to slide past ivys awareness because she had never been exposed to such concepts before hugo had lived more than twice as long experience had given him a more sober perspective he knew that hardy was not the only one in present peril but he tried hey goblins he called you cant do that my father says and whos your father twerp gorbage demanded good magician humfrey this made the goblins pause they had heard of humfrey monsters and kings came and went but the good magician was relatively eternal cant be gorbage finally concluded the old gnomes over a century old he wouldnt have any kids this age get on with the trial youve still got it wrong hugo said determinedly you have to have aa prosecutor and a defender and witnesses and all or gorbage swelled up like a toad with indigestion or what twerp hugo quailed before the challenge but ivy was sure he had the courage to continue for he was her night in shiny armor even if the armor didnt show any more than stanleys pedestal did as it turned out hugo did indeed have the courage or it doesnt count he said firmly who says it doesnt count gorbage demanded belliger ently again hugo needed a boost of confidence but ivys faith was strong and so he had it the law and people who dont follow the law of the land are crooks and thiefs and murderers and allaround bad folkwhich i guess goblins are anyway what the goblin chief exclaimed brandishing his dark fist its the harpies who are bad folk ill exterminate you you smartmouthed twit dragon on a pedestal yes of course hugo agreed thats what murderers do by definition again gorbage paused he was cunning enough to see that he could not handily disprove the charge of murder by mur dering his accuser hugo had verbally outmaneuvered him okay snot well have a persecutor and deafender and wit lesses he glared around but there were no free goblins all twelve were on the hanging jury but i have no more people too bad hugo said then you cant have a proper trial and everyone will know you for what you are a gutless mur derer who kills innocent people dead well have the trial gorbage insisted swelling to just this side of the bursting point you smartmouthyou be the deafender andand my daughterll be the persecutor then the murthe executions all legal i wont glory began but hugo interrupted her yes shell do it he said thats fair what glory shrieked hes up to something ivy whispered to her hes very smart youd better do it dismayed the goblin girl was silent okay now we got it gorbage said grimacing smugly persecutor make your winning case reluctantly glory went to stand before hardys post ivy saw her hand move toward her knife but she didnt draw it any attempt to cut hardys tether would bring the goblins down on them in a savage horde i intend toto prove to this dumb jury that the defendant is the handsomest finest nicest male creature alive better than any ugly old knobby kneed goblin out of order judge gorbage ruled youre supposed to prove that this feathered freak is guilty of corrupting and pol luting a fine goblin damsel and must be instantly put to death in the crudest possible manner stanley was quietly chewing on his net he had separated several strands and was working on others in due course he would be freeif he had time to complete the job without being noticed glorys eye fell on him and lighted with com drag on a pedestal prehension a loose dragon could disrupt a trial long enough for a tether to be cut she walked to the side attracting the goblins attention away from the dragon she was such a pretty girl that this was no problem every juryeye was riveted to her as she shook out her luxurious black hair and breathed deeply yes i shall prove all that and more she said with new emphasis at great length i call as the first witness the human child ivy someone better untie her so she can testify oh no you dont gorbage cried no conniving goblin tricks here she can speak well enough tied ivy walked up only her hands were tied gorbage glared at her you sniveling little snit do you swear to blab the truth most of the truth and nothing much except the truth or else sure ivy agreed interested in this procedure she had never been to a trial before stanley chomped through another strand i generally do now glory took over did you see this feathered freak here on this perch corrupting any innocent goblin girls hardy winced but didnt squawk he realized what was happening no ivy said stoutly what gorbage demanded in high dudgeon all he did was kiss her ivy said my father does that to my mother all the time except when they think im looking there was a stir of ire in the jury pollution a jurygoblin muttered ivys brow wrinkled i thought plooshun was bad water that too honey glory murmured smiling obscurely she adjusted her clothing again riveting the jury i now call the defendant as witness that liar cant be sworn in gorbage protested glory made a quartersmile is that true defendant are you unable to swear hardy let out a stream of profanity that wilted the adjacent vegetation and sent wisps of smoke curling up from the post he perched on glorys ears turned bright orangered and her mouth caved in as if she had swallowed her teeth but she turned to her father after a couple of attempts she managed to speak i dragon on a pedestal dont understand a word of that of course tell me father is that or is that not adequate swearing gorbage hastily wiped a gape of incredulous admiration off his face got to admitthats one thing a harpy can do pretty well he grudged very well she said primly i am taking the judges word that you have been properly sworn in defendant did you ever kiss any goblin girls only one hardy said there was another stir in the jury the cock confesses a goblin muttered get the rope ready and what is your intent toward said girl glory asked to marry her and take her away from all this the harpy testified gorbage turned mottled purple the audacity of this cretin execution is way too good for him but father glory protested innocently you have always maintained that the only fate worse than death is marriage there was a stifled snigger from the jury gorbage glared and the sound snigged out get on with it the judge gritted i trust i have made my case glory said with a certain demure smugness now let the defender take over hugo took the center stage his hands still bound behind him there was a faint crunch as stanley separated another strand of the net it was a tough net but the dragon had strong teeth ivy just knew hugo would do a brilliant job in an impossible situation already he looked handsome and confident despite being bound she saw several of the jurygoblins do double takes as if seeing him for the first time they had not realized how competent he would turn out to be is there any law against harpygoblin marriages he asked rhetorically famous lawyers were good at rhetoric ivy knew though she wasnt quite certain what the term meant gorbage and the jury burst out laughing they rolled on the ground expelling black tears of mirth i gather from this unbecoming levity that there is no law hugo concluded suavely just the way ivy had known he would a defender of his caliber could not be rattled by crude behavior dragon on a pedestal indeed historically there have been many such liaisons any of you could marry a harpy hen if you wanted to this set off an even more ferocious siege of merriment not even a cockatrice would care to marry a harpy hen and so a goblin girl can marry a harpy cock if she wants to hugo concluded brilliantly there is no cause for a trial let alone an execution i therefore move that this court be adjourned and the defendant set free suddenly the goblins were sober outrageous gorbage exclaimed marry a harpy why not eat zombie refuse while youre at it but there is no law hugo insisted therefore hardy cant be executed for yes he can gorbage insisted for polluting and cor rupting my innocent daughter the goblins of the jury ap plauded ivy had to admit to herself that the situation looked bad but she maintained confidence in hugos ability to handle it things always looked darkest just before the dawn that was part of the script and stanley was now halfway free of the net before long he would be ready to fight and she was sure he had built up plenty of whitehot steam very well hugo said smoothly i call the defendant as witness sure the cocks already incriminated himself proper gor bage said let the birdbrain do it some more hugo faced the post birdbruh defendant has the subject of marriage between you and the goblin girl been broached before this date hugo was sounding more like a lawyer as ivys confidence in him grew yes hardy said who broached it well actually she did i mean i would have asked her but she asked me first gorbage scowled but did not interfere and you accepted hugo persisted certainly i was flattered a pretty thing like her with such lovely legs hugo turned to the jury which was looking at the legs in dragon on a pedestal question note who was doing the corrupting she asked him so if one of them has to be executed no hardy cried dont try to incriminate her i dont want my freedom at her expense shes the sweetest most innocent creature imaginable she never corrupted anyone i surely am the guilty party gorbage nodded i couldnt have put it better myself hugo eyed hardy speculatively as if the defender were a dragon toying with trapped prey are you denying your prior testimony the harpy was taken aback well not exactly then you may step down hugo glanced at the perch and rope figuratively of course i call ivy as next witness ivy came forward again she had been working at her bonds but couldnt get her hands free who sought whom hugo asked her did the harpy go to meet the goblin in your experience well glory said he frowned competently no hearsay please what did you actually witness well i saw glory walking and did she seek out the harpy yes we helped her find him at the mouth organ so in your experience she went to meet him not vice versa the vice is all his gorbage cried that is hugo clarified for the less intelligent goblins she sought him not the other way around yes but that suffices hugo turned to the jury again as you can see the harpy is ready to perjure himself to save the goblin girl but we have now established independently that she was the one taking the initiative not he the defendant is therefore innocent of the charge of corrupting because he is in fact the one being corrupted you have no other choice but to let him off the jurors looked uncertainly at gorbage ridiculous the goblin chief exclaimed all thats out of order the dirty bird is on trial here hes the one to be executed dragon on a pedestal oh no hes not glory cried i did it i confess i cor rupted him im the one to be executed as goblins hugo said smoothly you can dismiss the confession of a harpy but you can not doubt the word of another goblin therefore never gorbage and hardy said together ivy knew the goblin chief didnt want to execute his own daughter he wanted to make her marry a goblin man hugo and glory had put him on the spot but gorbage was cunning and unscrupulous the very model of a goblin leader it is not for the persecutor or the deaf ender to decide the issue he proclaimed it is for the jury he turned to the other goblins juryreach your verdict you know what it is the juryrigged goblins pondered momentarily then caught on guilty they cried but thats not fair hugo protested losing some of his courtroom poise dont worrywell execute you too twerp after were done basting the bird gorbage turned to hardy deafendant you have been found guilty of corrupting and polluting this innocent goblin girl i hereby sentence you to be he paused considering the most awful way to do it to be burned at the stake and roasted for dinner he turned to the jurygoblins go fetch wood for the fire well have a feast the goblins dashed about foraging for wood no glory cried tearfully dont do it father let him go ill do any thing youll marry a goblin chief gorbage told her same as your sister did after the birds done stanley had almost freed himself but it looked as if he would be too late to help hardy the trial had not lasted quite long enough the goblins piled wood against hardys perch in moments the fire was ready to be lit gorbage produced one of his treasuresa huge mundane match the mundanes practiced very little magic but this firelighting stick was part of what they did have now who shall have the privilege of igniting the conflagration he asked dramatically dragon on a pedestal ill never speak to you again glory cried helplessly at her father unfazed by this dire threat gorbage turned to her ah yes the persecutor who is more fitting to light the fire he handed her the match youre insane she cried ill never can you guess what we shall do to the bird before we croak himif you dont gorbage asked her glory quailed it was obvious that the goblins practiced terrible tortures she couldnt let them do that to hardy ivy cast about for something to do to stop this but she and hugo remained tied stanley was not yet free and the goblins were all around glory approached the pileand drew her knife gorbage anticipating this dashed it out of her hand before she could try to cut the rope that tethered hardy you wouldnt be a goblin if you didnt try a trick like that gorbage said ap provingly youll make some chief real miserable someday now strike that match glorys head drooped tears squeezed from her eyes she found a rock and struck the match against it the match burst into flame hissing loudly she hurled it into the pile of brush where it ignited the dry leaves and moss set amidst the wood and threw herself after it no gorbage cried this time caught by surprise get her out of there but glory had hold of the post and already the fire was spreading through the eager brush she intended to die with her beloved ivy stumbled toward the fire not knowing what else to do she could not stop the flame even if her hands had not been tied she would have been largely helpless suddenly she was very much aware of the limitations of her age yet there was something goblins were everywhere screaming trying to get rid of the fire glory with goblinish cunning had certainly found the way to foul them up ivy fell into the brush on the side not yet burningand dragon on a pedestal there was glory her hand on hardys clawfoot crying and clinging tight you can do it ivy cried suddenly certain that love could conquer all you can save him somehow glory looked at her hardy looked down at her smoke wafted across stinging ivys eyes forcing them shutand when it passed and she opened them again tearily both glory and hardy were gone ivy blinked she saw the vines that formed the rope that had tied the harpys feet now they were tied about nothing and untying themselves in moments the vines dropped into the brush empty what was happening the goblins were staring equally mystified wheres the bird one cried wheres my daughter gorbage roared find them goblins scurried all around again searching for the fugi tives ivy felt something she was being hauled backward out of the burning brush before the flame reached her then hands were at her bonds untying them and soon she was free but when she turned to look there was no one there hugo standing beside her now looked startled his bonds were untying themselves too ivy saw the ropes flip about and release their knots stanley burst out of the net and came to join them hey the dragons loose a goblin cried the goblins turned and charged raising their clubsand stanley blasted them with steam sending them reeling back run a voice cried it sounded like glorybut she was not there well distract them you folk get away you helped us now well help you ivy and hugo and stanley ran two goblins pursued them but a fallen branch lifted itself up and tripped them then a flaming branch came from the brushfire and waved itself about menacingly daunted the goblins fell back it seemed the inanimate was coming to life to threaten them the trio made it to the shelter of a nearby tree dragon on a pedeital whats happening ivy asked breathlessly i never saw magic like this before theyre invisible hugo said using his enhanced intellect to figure it out see stanley can hear them and smell them hes not worried indeed he wasnt the little dragon was grinning with all his sharp little teeth as he watched the burning branch set fire to the pants of one goblin since goblins did not wear pants it was quite an effect but goblins cant do magic ivy said neither can har pies now they can hugo said only human people have magic talents ivy insisted then she remembered the centaurs and halfhumans well shes half human and so is he he pointed out together they must have a talentand its invisibility ivy realized that when she had joined the couple and willed them to save themselves she had enhanced their hidden joint talent now together glory and hardy became invisible be cause no one could see them they had been able to free them selves and ivy and hugo without interference gorbage no dummyivy was beginning to realize the full meaning of that termcaught on at almost the same time its them he cried see her footprints there must have been some invisible wood in that pile and the smoke got on them follow those footprints invisible wood ivy asked it looked visible to me gorbage doesnt know about your talent hugo said so he figures theres some other agency thats just as well the goblins oriented on the footprints but then even these stopped hes carrying her through the air hugo said hap pily i dont think he can lift her weight for long but it should be enough to lose the goblins wed better flee before they remember us they fled hearing the uproar fade behind them then the mouth organ started playing again drowning out everything else with its rich mellow notes and harmonies im glad glory and hardy got away ivy said when the party felt safe from pursuit dragon on a pedestal im glad we got away hugo said gorbage was going to kill us too ivy shuddered knowing it was true she always thought the best of new people but she was learning the hard way that not all folk deserved that regard they had walked into more than they expected when they met glory goblin but it had been the right thing to do love had triumphed in the end as it was supposed to the search capture trial and escape had used up the main part of the day they ate a supper of assorted conjured fruits located some hammock trees and settled down for the night stanley had some trouble getting used to a hammock but en joyed it when he mastered it they slept in relative comfort and suffered only a few bad dreams chapter hardy harpy i hey were down to four nowchem grundy the gorgon and irene this was easier though the others had certainly done their parts the gorgons memory was returning nicely now that she was among friends irenes questions and comments acted to refresh what the forgetwhorl had fogged but irene knew it had been a close call if the gorgon had passed through the center of the whorl she would have been beyond recovery and if zora zombie had not taken the curse intended for irene irene herself would now be a statue we can work together irene suggested to the gorgon grundy can ask the plants whether they have any news of either ivy or hugo and when you leam hugos whereabouts you can go directly there dragon on a pedestal that seems reasonable the gorgon agreed she had wanted to join forces at the outset irene remembered it might have been better if they had done so the last news i have of ivy is that she was in the cyclops cave irene continued so ill just start looking for that i have my ivy plant that shows shes still healthy so i know nothing has happened to her yet but the muse said she was going to get into trouble soon i want to find her before night if possible there is a goodly portion of the day remaining chem pointed out encouragingly grundy queried the local flora and fauna he was in luck many of them knew where the dread oneeyed monster lurked this entire region had been largely cleaned out of dragons and griffins because of the cyclops voracious appetite for meat the smaller creatures appreciated that and felt the cyclops was not such a bad fellow but still they preferred not to encounter him directly just in case hearing that irene became even more eager to recover her daughter quickly she didnt like taking chances either as they progressed the references became more specific it seemed that the cyclops hunted only at night but he was a terror then either ivy had escaped the cyclops and was safe from pur suit while day remained or she was still in the cave perhaps trapped there there was no separate news of her or of hugo to the gorgons disappointment she looked worried under her veil she did not have the assurance of an ivy plant that her son was healthy and considering hugos general backward ness and lack of an effective magical talent irene could ap preciate her concern then there was something new grundy paused i didnt know there was a mouth organ in these parts mouth organ irene asked thats a natural musical instrument chem explained part plant part animal part mineral it has many mouths that sound separate notes its a rare thing but it does occur in scattered locations and can attain considerable size it is said to be very impressive when it spawns the little mouth organs can be dragon on a pedestal plucked and played by hand as they arent big enough to generate their own wind but handling stunts their growth so few make it to maturity its hard to be a success if youre a plaything grundy agreed irene cocked her head now she heard it faintly as from a fair distance to the eastdeep powerful sustained notes decorated by a pleasant higher melody this one sounds ma ture she said shortly very nice some day we must visit it but at the moment we have a more urgent mission im not sure grundy said the organ is speaking mu sically and i can understand it because of its animate portion it says there are goblins in the area goblins chem asked thats unlikely all the major tribes of goblins settled north of the gap chasm there might be a few stragglers south but not enough to cause any prob lems the organ says a war party is here the golem insisted it says that yesterday the goblins captured a male harpy in the course of their raid into harpy territory they were going to execute him a male harpyexecuted chem asked that will in stantly inflame the whole harpy species they have very few males and they value them inordinately now irene took notice goblins on the warpathhere ivy could run into them what else does the organ say nothing much its just alerting the harpiesthat male hasnt been seen since last nightso they can form a battle wing and wipe out the goblins there will be war very soon thats all we need the gorgon said a resurgence of the old goblinharpy war my husband has texts delineating the atrocities of their ancient wars xanth is much gentler to day the gap chasm kept them apart for centuries chem said there are several bridges across it but they are guarded by human folk who wouldnt let goblins pass one of the bridges is oneway so the goblins couldnt pass it anyway and another is invisible so they couldnt find it the only practical way they could cross is through the gap and of course the gap dragon on a pedestal dragon she paused a bulb flashing thats what the dragon did it stopped the goblins from crossing so as to preserve peace in xanth the goblinharpy wars were the worst calam ities in xanth apart from the mundane waves of conquest and the gap dragon helped inhibit those too im sure it was no accident that castle roogna was built south of the gap and that most of the civilized settlements of men and centaurs were also south perhaps we owe in this peculiar fashion the sur vival of civilization in xanth to the gap dragon so there was excellent reason for the good magician to spare the gap dragon even if it was rampaging irene agreed awed by the revelation that was the last monster she would have expected to owe anything to there is good reason for anything humfrey does the gorgon said seriously he always did know what he was doing no matter what others thought he always did irene agreed but now the forgetspell is off the gap the dragon is gone humfrey can not act and the ancient mischief is returning were in more trouble than we knew king dor will certainly have to act to nullify the goblins chem said but for the moment this merely makes our mis sion more urgent we must rescue the children quickly theres no telling what will happen if they fall into goblin hands they hurried on toward the cyclops cave before very long there was a raucous screech from the sky great ugly birdshapes appeared goblins destroy them an unlovely female voice screeched great gross harpies converged descending from the sky filthy talons extended there were twelve or fifteen of them chems bow was in her hands but she withheld her shot knowing that if she killed one dirty hen the others would tear the whole party to bits the gorgon put her hand on her veil she could deal with them all if she had to were not goblins irene cried desperately trying reason before combat the leaderharpy hovered before them peering she had a hideous and filthy face dangling lumpy breasts soiled tail feathers and a nauseating odor she was about as repulsive as dragon on a pedestal a creature could get not so much for her shape as for her lack of hygiene and her bad nature why so youre not the harpy screeched you made us waste all this effort for nothing wed better tear you apart anyway let me talk to them chem said be ready gorgon we may still need you the gorgon nodded keeping one hand on her veil ready to jerk it aside and glare about listen to me chem told the harpy leader we arent goblins and we are not involved with them we have no quarrel with youbut we do have power to defend ourselves if you force the issue leave us alone and we shall leave you alone the harpies hovered in air made foul by their presence the stench was assuming an awful intensity you can defend your selves the leader screeched prove it you wouldnt like that chem said wamingly youre bluffing the harpy screeched no harpy seemed to have any voice other than the screech too much of this conversation would give a person a headache this woman is the gorgon the centaur said evenly one glance at her bare face will turn a person to stone i dont believe it the harpy screeched hatty rip that rag off her face then pluck out her eyeballs a harpy lunged forward spraying out small soiled feathers in her eagerness to get at the eyeball tidbits irene kept her eyes on the harpy not the gorgon as did the others of her party she was aware peripherally of the gorgon making a slight motion then the harpy hatty stopped in midair and dropped like a stone this was only natural she had become a stone the gorgon replaced her veil the other harpies flew down to look at their fallen comrade hatty was now an ugly statue that looked as if it had been too long under pigeons her calcified eyes gazed out in blind con tempt and her thinlipped mouth was fixed in a perpetual scowl even a small drool of dirty spittle had frozen to stone on her lip shes petrified a harpy screeched dragon on a pedestal completely stoned grundy agreed you dirty birds cant say we didnt warn you and who the smut are you runt the leader screeched im grundy the golem grundy said proudly i can talk to any living thing even your kind you nauseating hen though have to hold my nose who the upchuck are you im haggy harpy leader of this motley flock the harpy screeched were looking for goblins who are those others again irene was cautious about identifying herself com pletely im irene i grow plants and im chem the centaur said i make maps haggy hovered pondering while her flapping wings wafted the smell of her past them stoningtalkingplanting mapping she screeched totaling it up a pretty collection of talents you creatures are lucky not everyone has magic she rotated to address the others hannah execute plan sa she said then she spun in air back to irene what are you doing out here in harpy territory im looking for my lost child irene said a girl three years old have you seen her anybody seen her brat haggy screeched to the other harpies who were milling about in some private pattern that continually wafted their foul odor past the party on the ground irene hoped she could keep from gagging there was a discordant response no one had seen any lost human child ssaaa hanna harpy screeched suddenly the harpies swooped in acting together two carried a bag which they dropped over the gorgons head before the gorgon could get her hand back up to her veil others carried vinecords which they wrapped around the others the action was so quick and treacherous that chem did not have time to raise her bow grow irene cried desperately at any plant in range the grass under chems hooves shot up and nearby trees put on new foliage but there was nothing to interfere with the harpies naturally the confined seeds in the bag did not grow that would have been a worse disaster than the harpies in a moment all four of them were captive dragon on a pedestal plan sa sneak attack grundy said disgustedly i should have realized irene cursed herself for the same oversight goblins and harpies were creatures largely without honor she knew that it had been folly to relax why did you dirty birds do that grundy demanded of the harpies we did nothing to you except for when hatty forced the issue and we had given you fair warning about that you can fix her bad as new by carrying her statue out to mundania where the spell will be broken we dont care about hatty hannah screeched who cares about a harpy we wanted you because we can use your talents haggy screeched sat isfied now we can track down those goblins faster butbut you cant just capture us and make us work for you irene spluttered why cant we haggy screeched reasonably for one thing well refuse to do your bidding chem said swishing her tail in irritation no bidding you old biddy grundy agreed oh will you now the harpy chieftainess screeched well then well just tear your stonemason friend to pieces one piece at a time were due for a meal anyway she turned in the air to face her subordinate hen hannah old cackle lets see how fast you can get the first arm off that creature dont go near her hood hannah screeched with delight hold her tight hens i dont want her thrashing about while im at work that would spill too much tasty blood maybe ill start with her gizzard thats easier to claw out the other hens converged on the hooded and bound gorgon sinking their filthy talons into her limbs securing her for the ordeal irene knew they werent bluffing harpies really did like to tear flesh apart and cause anguish to feeling creatures and fetch a basin haggy screeched so we can have a blood bath afterward irenes stomach tried to take flight like a harpy no they werent bluffing all right well cooperate irene said quickly dont hurt her dragon on a pedestal haggy harpy screeched out a mindrotting string of epithets oh youre spoiling our fun cant you wait until weve done with this one shes a fine healthy specimen and i just know shes got a lot of hot blood in her no i cant wait irene cried in her desperation sounding almost like a harpy herself dont touch her oh all right spoilsport haggy screeched i guess we can use her talent on the goblins as we planned hannah youll have to wait go suck eggs hannah screeched back she had been hovering waiting for the others to secure the victim properly exposing the gorgons midriff for the gizzard operation i want blood she launched herself at the gorgon talons ex tended mouth gaping with lust for gore dont tell me to suck eggs you bloated bag haggy screeched launching herself after her she moved very swiftly harpies had had many generations of experience snatching things and could zip forward in the blink of a smudged eye the two collided in the air haggy lifted a claw and made such a swipe at the other that several greasy feathers were wrenched out of her tail assembly hannah spun out of control sideswiped a tree and landed on her back her spindly chicken legs poking straight up she screeched such an oath that the grass around her turned brown then she flipped over and flapped up leaving a smudge of discolor on the ground she perched on a branch shaking out loose feathers discipline had evidently been asserted in the normal harpy fashion now this is what youll do haggy screeched to irene youll grow us some blood lilies and a pitcher plant of gall for us to snack on and the horses rear will show us a map so we can guess where the goblins are and the imp im a golem not an imp grundy said will ask around for the goblins haggy finished and if we dont find them by nightfall well tear stonestare up instead that seems fair enough dont you agree ill bet those little snakes on her head are mighty tasty morsels irene didnt even ask whether the harpies would let the party go if they found the goblins harpies didnt make positive promises only threats youll have to free my hands so i can dragon on a pedestal son through my seeds she said i cant grow what you want if i dont have the seeds well do it haggy screeched but if you grow any wrong thing your hooded friend will be gutted before you can do anything else and well make you drink the first blood unfair hannah screeched you promised me first blood oh all right well give you the blood and stuff the first entrails into the captives mouths haggy decided being a fairminded hen horrified irene knew they had effectively prevented her from growing a tangle tree or anything else that would be useful against this awful flock she opened the big bag of seeds and sifted through it looking for the proper ones she was in luck for what that was worth she found the items she needed she dropped them to the ground grow the blood lilies came up and formed deep red bulbs while the pitcher plant developed pitchers filled with liquid that would kill flies the harpies snatched both eagerly and slurped them down messily the dirty birds were even more repulsive when eating than when screeching while the hens were distracted irene consulted with grundy do you think you can locate the goblin band our lives may depend on it ill locate something the golem promised i can start by going toward the mouth organ since it has seen them i know they were in that region good enough irene said and if somewhere along the way you get a chance to lift the gorgons hood you scheming females are all alike grundy said irene smiled cynically some day youll encounter one your size and shell make you happy to be schemed into captivity if you live through this present crisis i can hardly wait but the golem was momentarily thoughtful soon the harpies were through gobbling their food now get on it imp haggy screeched find those goblins grundy jumped to the ground and made a show of ques tioning the local plants naturally none of them had seen the dragon on a pedestal goblins that way he announced pointing in the direction of the mouth organ the harpies were so eager for blood and gore that they didnt realize he was pointing toward their own publicaddress system map map haggy screeched chem projected a map of the region it didnt have much detail because the centaur hadnt seen enough of the local terrain yet but it did show sufficient gross accuracy to satisfy the harpies that it was valid the harpies had to free chems feet so she could walk but they left her arms bound and one of them hovered near enough to attack her if she tried to bolt they tied irenes hands again and had her ride the centaur they kept the gorgon walking separately another harpy screeching directions at her so she could find her way despite the hood irene was both saddened and angered to see her friend stumbling blindly her hands bound but she could do nothing about it they proceeded slowly north constantly harrassed by the harpies who wanted them to do the job faster then grundy got a breakhe intersected the trail of the goblins thirteen goblins were traveling southwest there was no harpy with them that means they killed him sure enough haggy screeched well tear out their hearts and stuff them up their the rest became unintelligible which was just as well for the leaves of the nearest trees were turning brown and curling up harpies did seem to have a certain flair for that sort of thing hot on the trail the harpies spread out and became silent they knew their screeching would instantly alert the enemy and put the goblins on guard one bird flew high above the trees trying to spy the new prey casting her baleful glare hither and yon and soon she succeeded she swooped low straight ahead on an island in a water table she reported in a whispering shriek we can surround it they think theyre safe there but they cant fly irene realized that this was a typical mistake creatures who could not fly had little awareness of the threat from the air until it was upon them we wont take a chance haggy decided thirteen against dragon on a pedestal thirteenthats too nearly even we dont want a fair fight we want an easy slaughter well make stoneface look at them they had it backward irene saw they didnt realize that it was not the gorgons gaze that petrified people but the sight of her full face irene was not about to correct their misimpression but shell look at us too another warned thats right better not risk it right now well bomb them instead get your eggs ready how the harpies carried eggs irene wasnt sure but it seemed they had them somewhere she also was not certain what good it would do to drop eggs on the goblins unless the intent was to blind the enemy with the splats of whites and yokes the harpies flew into the sky trailing small swirls of greasy feathers oh hannah haggy screeched in an afterthought now you can take care of these creatures here they have become surplus goody hannah screeched back she looped about and flew toward irenes party she was slightly unsteady because of the recent loss of tail feathers but could maneuver well enough her hideous face gloated grundy irene cried but the golem was too far from the gorgon to reach her before the harpy did instead it was chem who leaped to the gorgons rescue her hands were tied but she tried to use her teeth bending to take a grip on the hood but hannah did not come in that close she banked spread her legs and laid an egg in midair die she screeched as the missile slanted down watch out grundy cried at the same time i just re membered what those eggs do chem lurched away fram the falling egg pushing the gor gon down the egg struck the ground beside them and ex ploded there was a dirty boom and brush and turf were blasted out leaving a small crater the eggs really were bombs irene realized that the harpies probably ate pineapples when forming a battle wing to get the explosive ingredients they really were prepared for war grundy unhurt skirted the crater and reached them he dragon on a pedestal climbed on the gorgons bagged head tugging at the cloth but it was tied on and the cord was too firmly knotted for him to budge meanwhile the harpy circled did she have another egg no wonder they dont reproduce much chem exclaimed grundy laughed it would be hard to hatch a live harpy chick from an exploding egg but the peril wasnt funny grundy get me a seed irene cried hurry the golem scrambled to her bag and fetched out a random handful of seeds grow irene ordered the handful the seeds sprouted immediately irene could of course grow plants with her hands tied behind her but it was chancy starting a random sample those seeds could develop into anything and the result might be harmless or negative a coral plant began to form coral on the golems hand and he hastily dropped the seeds a sugar palm sent out a hand formed of sugar ironwood speared up points already coated with rust because of their proximity to the water table a saucer plant presented its dishes a hunters horn plant blew a loud note mistletoe nudged the earth with its toenail and fired off its seedpod and a split rock plant dug its roots into the nearest rock and split it into two sharpedged fragments grundy jumped down and lifted one of those fragments he brought it to the gorgons bound hands and started sawing but now hannah harpy was coming in again evidently she had another egg ready chem projected a map it showed a boulder where the people were and people where a nearby boulder was the harpy blinked then corrected course and dropped her egg it smacked into the boulder and broke it into a pile of rocks sand showered around them the gorgons hands came free she reached up to draw the hood from her head but the tie was at the back and did not yield to her fumbling fingers use the stone to cut it irene ordered the harpy had realized that something was wrong chems maps were good but were not true illusions a person could see reality through the maps when the proper effort was made dragon on a pedestal hannah looped about ready to lay another egg on them and this one would not miss here she comes again grundy said and that old hen has blood in her grotesque eye irene was horribly sure that was true but there was one chance gorgon if you can see anything at allthrow that stone the gorgon scratched the sharp edge of the stone across her face ripping the bag in front of her eyes now she could see out vaguely she hurled the stone at the swooping harpy her aim was good the stone struckand the egg deto nated the harpy had not yet released it the explosion was muffled truly appalling hail pelted them and the stench was beyond belief irene wiped the gook out of her eyes and peered up there was nothing left of hannah harpy but a foul cloud of smoke it was dull gray tinged with streaks of bloodred hey the prisoners are making a break another harpy screeched weve got to get out of here irene said tersely now there was a clamor on the water table the remaining harpies had attacked the goblins and great and awful was the sound and fury thereof the gorgon left the scratched hood on her head so she could see out without having her deadly face exposed and hastened to work on chems bonds soon the centaur was free she took her bow and aimed an arrow at the sky the first harpy who came close enough to lay an egg would be shot down now the gorgon came to irene and undid her hands their party was ready to move but irene was uncertain the forest is too open if we flee well be vulnerable to attack from the rear i dont want any of those eggs coming at my rear wed better take cover until its safe chem agreed they moved onto the water table which was a raised level plain formed of jellied water with a solid crust it was a bluegreen level surface and it sank beneath their weight slightly forming a slow ripple on the far side of the table stood the goblin band armed with clubs and spears and stones and scowls the harpies were dragon on a pedestal divebombing them but the rain of thrown stones was thick enough to keep them too far away to score geysers of water shot up where the eggs missed their marks the crust of the table was firm and flexible but the explosions gouged out holes that took a while to reseal three harpies detached themselves from the main formation and zeroed in on irenes party irene plunged her hand into the seed bag and scattered the seeds she brought out grow the seeds sprouted in air and landed on the water table where their roots delved down to find plenty of water for rapid growth leatherleaf ferns spread their leather across the plain a golddust tree sent out a cloud of glittering gold dust a foxglove swished its bushy tail and made hand signals with its glove an amethyst plant grew purple crystals that sparkled in the sunshine a balloon vine sent a cloud of colored balloons into the sky a helmet flower produced several fine helmets in assorted sizes that irene and the others harvested for im mediate use in case an egg exploded nearby a living fossil plant rattled its bones and a waterivy had a field day spread ing so quickly and thickly that it soon covered a sizable portion of the table the vines and leaves became so big and piled on one another so thickly that they provided good cover for the party the tabletop had become a thick jungle the goblins spied the jungle and charged toward it recog nizing the advantage of its cover uhoh irene said i didnt think of this consequence now well have goblins to contend with too indeed it was so when the goblins arrived and discovered that the jungle was occupied they hurled some of their stones at these new targets it had turned into a threeway battle the thick cover became a mixed blessing irene and her friends were hidden from the harpies who wheeled and screeched their curses from above ready to egg anyone who respondedbut the goblins were also hidden from both irene and the harpies and she knew goblins were good at jungle combat a goblin appeared before chembut disappeared as she swung her bow around to aim at him the thickly spreading leaves concealed too much dragon on a pedestal a harpy spied the motion and zoomed down close and laid her egg it detonated to the side blasting out greenery that splatted green all around them a dark gnarly hand grasped irenes arm she jerked around to look not daring to scream because of the listening harpies and came face to snoot with an ugly goblin the goblin opened his big mouth showing his sharp yellow teeth he lunged to bite irenes leg she twisted her leg away then kneed him in the ear ow the goblins head was undamaged but irenes knee was hurt ing dont hit their heads grundy called theyre hard as rocks hit their hands and feet irene stomped on one of the goblins big feet but the ground was so squishy that the foot merely sank into the soft water unhurt then she grabbed one of the goblins arms wrenched it about and slammed the goblins own hand into his head owww the goblin screamed my hands broken a harpy heard his cry and circled trying to pinpoint the source she screeched a corrosive curse soon there would be an egg on both their heads irene knew she had to dispatch this creature quickly now she moved her captured arm the one the goblins hand was grasping and jammed that against his rockhead she knocked the goblins hand against his skull and it was the hand that gave way that made him let go then chem got there and swept him away with a wellplaced kick in the head it didnt hurt the goblin the way a kick in the seat would have but it drove him so far into the foliage that irene was able to hide herself again weve got to get out of this or well all be dead irene gasped she had not had much experience with this sort of combat and didnt like it at all i think id better use my power the gorgon said touching her head irene sighed i suppose we have no reasonable alternative then there was a stir among the wheeling harpies its him its him they screeched dragon on a pedestal irene peered out through the foliage all she saw was another harpy coming to reinforce the others bad news him chem asked the male they thought the goblins killed now irene realized the significance of this arrival then they have no cause for war oh theyll fight anyway grundy said harpies and gob lins always fight one another when they get the chance well they shouldnt do it while were caught in the middle irene exclaimed perhaps i can arrange a truce chem said the moment seems propitious and i believe i have encountered the goblin leader before anythings worth a try irene said her hands were cold and clammy and she hoped she didnt look as flustered as she felt she just wanted to get out of this battle and back on the search for her child chem concentrated her map appearedthis time it was not a scene but a huge display of letters truce simul taneously the centaur called gorbage gorbage goblin few harpies could read but the leaders were more educated than most truce haggy harpy screeched outraged truce who says and the goblin leader called back who calls my name i am chem centaur chem replied i call for this truce because you goblins and harpies have no quarrel and i want to show you this before you destroy your best chance for peace peace gorbage and haggy screeched together we dont want peace haggy continued we want war gorbage finished but irene protested bemused the old hen is right gorbage said we havent had a good war in eight hundred years its long overdue thats for sure haggy screeched the newly arrived harpy male swooped in now irene could see that his face and feathers were clean and that he was in fact a handsome halfspecimen of a man we shall talk peace anyway he cried and his voice too was unlike the screech dragon on a pedestal of the hens we shall make truce and listen to the centaur for centaurs are known to be fairminded folk the harpy hens fluttered uncertainly since they could not argue with the precious male if you say so haggy screeched grudgingly well dont say so gorbage cried from his cover in the foliage i want to exterminate them allbeginning with that birdbrained cock he pointed at the male harpy a lovely female goblin appeared then youll have to ex terminate me also father she cried i love him a harpygoblin romance this was another surprise a goblin tart haggy screeched indignantly well bury her in eggs you certainly will not the male harpy cried im going to marry her irene was amazed its true then no wonder these crea tures are riled up thats the most forbidden love for them wed better get a truce chem said in a moment therell be nothing but feet and feathers irene felt in her bag for seeds she found what she wanted several wallflowers she threw the seeds out in four directions aiming and orienting each carefully grow they grew one wall formed just behind irenes party ex panding east and west shoving aside the prior vegetation oth ers grew to the sides extending north and south a fourth grew to the north extending east and west soon they all intersected at the edges making comers and forming a roughly square enclosure their walls thickened and gained height with flow ers on the top until no one could see anything but sky from the inside chem you face north and have your bow ready irene said gorgon you face south with your hand on your veil er hood or whatever ill try to watch the sky grundy climb up on the wall and tell gorbage and haggy and the two um lovers to come in here under truce so we can talk safely watch out for thrown missiles gotcha the golem agreed he found handholds and clam bered up the south wall i hope you can apply centaur logic to this situation chem dragon on a pedestal irene murmured if you cant persuade them were still in trouble her stomach felt weak she didnt like the continuing tension of this situation she knew her plants had gained them only a temporary reprieve the logic is validif they will listen chem said but neither species is known for listening well grundy reached the top of the wall and stood on it a tiny figure hey stinksnoot he cried come in here and show off your ignorance you too filthfeather then he ducked as a rock flew by and an egg slanted down i think you chose the wrong diplomat chem remarked grundy thinks its a challenge to be as foulmouthed as the others i should have known irene agreed ruefully ill have to mediate this myself youll get your head bombed chem warned perhaps we can be of assistance a new voice said irene looked around but saw nothing who spoke were invisible the voice said we dont want to get shot or stoned invisible well if youre friendly show yourselves we wont attack you two figures faded into viewthe male harpy and the fe male goblin the lovers irene exclaimed how we discovered our magic talent the girl said almost shyly she was remarkably pretty goblins dont do magic and nei ther do harpiesnot the way human folk dobut together we can become invisible she moved to rejoin the harpy and they faded out again recessive genes maybe chem said as the two reap peared she glanced more closely at the girl you look fa miliar ive seen a goblin girl almost as pretty as you my big sister goldy the girl said im glory the love liest and nicest of my generation and this is hardy the hand somest and bestmannered of his irene introduced herself and her friends were looking for my lost daughter dragon on a pedestal ivy glory exclaimed the cute little child with the bone in her hair irene was astonished you met her she helped me find hardy glory said now i can see the family affinity her hair is a little green while yours when she gets jealous her whole face turns green grundy remarked returning from the wall a bone in her hair chem inquired she said the cyclops gave it to her glory explained she was very helpful she and hugo and stanley hugo the gorgon asked hes with them oh yes he has such a wonderful talent but he can only conjure rotten fruit glory laughed you wouldnt say that if you knew him well i am his mother glory gazed at her perplexed you must have excruciat ingly exacting standards his fruit certainly seemed good enough to me and hes so intelligent intelligent the gorgon asked oh yes and handsome the gorgon shook her hooded head baffled stanley irene asked picking up on the other name stanley steamer the baby dragon hes really very nice too nice irene repeated blankly the rejuvenated gap dragon glory smiled and the wallflower enclosure brightened youre being humorous right that must be the case irene agreed faintly something was certainly funny here but not humorous how did you meet them i was coming south from the gap looking for hardy and i suppose i was lost or at least mislaid but the dragon located the mouth organ for us and so we found hardy and the goblins ambushed us the harpy continued they put me on trial for corrupting glory but hugos brilliant de fense acquitted me i just dont understand the gorgon said naturally i want the best for my son but simply have to say that he was never dragon on a pedestal brilliant or handsome or well talented i wish it were otherwise but it sounds as if his qualities have been improved chem commented ivy irene exclaimed shes responsible that was my thought the centaur agreed i suspect that her talent of enhancement is more potent than we knew she has elevated hugo to his full potential but the dragon irene said the dragon should have be come even more ferocious by the same enhancement not if her talent is selective chem pointed out if it should for example enhance only what she perceives or chooses to perceive or wishes it would require magicianlevel talent to make my boy a genius the gorgon said ruefully for a long time i hoped he would improve as he aged but now hes eight years old and has shown no sign eight if hes not a genius hes close to it glory said he picked up on precisely the right points anyway hardy said hugo won my casebut the gob lin chief glorys father reneged and set up to execute me and i joined him in the fire glory continued her eyes shining ivy joined us tooand suddenly we found our talent and were invisible that made the difference and in the con fusion we were able to escape ivys talent chem said much more potent than we knew that combined harpygoblin talent of invisibility must have been latent the stress of the situation and ivys power of enhancement must have joined to bring it out who ever would have suspected that a joint interspecies talent could exist well if half souls exist irene said maybe half talents exist too the centaur smiled surely so there is much we have yet to learn about the magic of xanth and it seems that hardy and glory are well matched since their half talents match it occurred to irene that it was possible that all goblins and all harpies had half talents of invisibility which could only be matched by the portion in the other species so that this was dragon on a pedestal not necessarily an indication of the compatibility of these two particular individuals but there was no point in making that caveat it would accomplish nothing so we fled my fathers band glory concluded and ivy and hugo and stanley escaped too for the goblins were fol lowing our footprints hardy carried me part of the way though i weigh as much as he does and he couldnt lift me far but when darkness came we camped in a tree my fathers band couldnt reach and got a good nights rest she paused to blush delicately part of the night anyway we gave them the slip hardy said but they kept casting about searching for us so we couldnt really relax today we were getting pretty tired glory said but now with the harpies we heard the commotion hardy said i recognized the screeching and thought i could reassure my people that the mouth organs news was inoperative i believe have enough of the picture now chem said but we can do nothing unless we get the leaders to negotiate i can get my father to come in here glory said but he wont listen to reason and i can get haggy harpy here hardy said all males are princes in harpydom she must come at my call but she wont listen either fetch them in and keep them from fighting chem said and i will try to get through to them i may not be as eloquent as you say hugo was but we may yet abate this war goblin and harpy shrugged anything was worth trying then glory climbed the south wall flashing some remarkably wellformed limbs while hardy flew into the sky there had been little commotion from either side during this dialogue perhaps because neither could be sure where the present ad vantage lay father glory called from the wall you must come in here and talk to the harpy leader under truce never gorbage answered his voice faint but ugly in the distance otherwise i just might throw myself to my doom glory said making as if to jump off the wall it really wasnt high oregon on a pedestal enough for the fall to be fatal but the bluff worked gorbage agreed to come in hardy had an easier time come down and negotiate he told haggy or ill tell the queen harpy you suck eggs that cowed the hen im no eggsucker she screeched and flapped down to perch on the north wall now both leaders were present haggy settling her blotchy feathers gorbage draping his knobby legs astride the south wall both glared at each other and at anyone else in range it was obvious that neither cared to be reasonable first chem said i ask each of you to explain to your people that we are armed with accurate arrows and the stare of the gorgon anyone who tries to storm this bastion will face the consequence gorbage and haggy knowing this was true informed their parties but neither showed any willingness to cease hostilities irene knew this was the main problem human folk would have wanted to find a way to avert bloodshed but the goblins and harpies really did want to fight for more than a thousand years the goblins and the harpies have been at war chem said it started because of over crowding and misunderstanding and foul deeds were done on both sides but king roogna got things straightened away and for eight hundred years the war has been quiescent with the gap chasm and the gap dragon separating the parties there has not been very much occasion for strife but now it seems a romance has developed between the species ill kill the fowl cock gorbage cried smirching my fair daughter thats smooch not smirch father glory murmured listen bulbnose haggy screeched your slut of a whelp of a daughter tempted him with her obscene legs just like in the old days she should swallow an egg sidewise whats wrong with her legs hardy demanded ill egg her right now haggy screeched rising into the air but chems arrow tracked her progress ready to zing from the bow and the gorgon turned to face the harpy her hand tugging at the hood haggy settled back down muttering do you folk really object to interspecies marriages chem asked dragon on a pedestal of course garbage cried why should we let miscegina tion pollute our pure goblin breed my daughter will marry a goblin chief never glory cried we have enough trouble preserving our species haggy screeched we dont need goblin sluts adulterating our stock and most of all we dont need goblins invading our territory and killing off our few precious males well keep those motley cocks away from our unspoiled maidens gorbage yelled back you sure dont see our males going after your stinking hens they couldnt catch them haggy shot back regardless chem cut in loudly we do have a cross species romance here and i think your objections are not well founded many of the creatures of xanth are crossbreeds the griffins merfolk chimerae basilisks manticoraand of course my own species the centaurs the harpies are an an cient crossbreed line you should not object to further cross breeding not the goblins gorbage said we are of straight semi humanoid stock as are the elves gnomes and ogres chem agreed i think there is as much variation in the humanoid variants as in the crossbreeds would you prefer to have your daughter marry an ogre gorbage spluttered while haggy burst out in raucous laugh ter marry an orgre she screeched breed some looks and intelligence into your stock listen rotteneggbrain my point is chem said cutting their insults off again crossbreeds and humanoid variants should not be ashamed to continue the traditions of xanth maybe in drear mundania the species dont mix much but xanth is not mundane thats why xanth is so much better we creatures of xanth have much greater freedom to would you breed with some other kind of crossbreed not a centaur haggy screeched challengingly the old biddys got you there horsy gorbage cried would you dragon on a pedestal yes chem said if he were a worthwhile creature and if there were mutual respect and appreciation centaurs arent supposed to fib haggy cried yeah gorbage asked at the same time like what like a hippogryph she answered irene watched her wondering how far chem would go to make her point centaurs were relatively open about some topics that human folk preferred to keep secret but her liaison with xap was really no business of these foulminded creatures both the old and the young harpies looked at the centaur surprised as did the young and old goblins it was evident that no one had anticipated this answer aw shes making it up gorbage said after a pause theres no birdhorse to call her bluff but there is one haggy screeched victoriously he be longs to the witchs boy xap chem said who carries xavier son of xanthippe haggys ugly mouth gaped she knows him gorbage was equally astounded shes really been with a hippogryph she must have been haggy screeched the two of them looked at irene what do you know of this claim gorbage asked its true irene said chem traveled with xap then shes worse than any of us haggy screeched in dignantly she sure is gorbage agreed the two looked at each other startled they were agreeing have you noticed chem said how few goblins and harpies there are compared to what there used to be and how many crossbreeds there are and how vigorous they are now both goblin and harpy were sullenly silent did it occur to you that maybe your close inbreeding is weakening both your species chem continued the straight human beings were losing power in xanth until they reopened the border and mixed with fresh new mundanes human folk didnt want to do that for they have always been afraid of the mundane waves and contemptuous of the mundane inability to do magic but they did interbreedand now the human dragon on a pedestal folk are strong and goblins and harpies are weak when once it was the other way around before long historically youll fade away entirelyespecially if you keep killing one another off you would both do better as species if you made peace and let your people interbreed any who wanted to ludicrous haggy screeched appalling gorbage shouted again they looked at each other finding themselves in un settling agreement let me show you something chem said you both know that neither goblins nor harpies have magic powers thats another reason neither is prospering in xanth now mutely they nodded please watch what hardy and glory do together oh no we wont haggy screeched were respectable creatures we wont sit still for that kind of obscenity will we gorbage certainly not the goblin chief agreed emphatically were decent naturallawabiding folk the harpy spread her wings and the goblin edged across the wall both ready to jump down into the enclosure to preserve decency as they knew it but the gorgon turned to face one and then the other her hand at her hood and they settled back without further protest decency wasnt that important hardy and glory joined hand and clawand disappeared haggy almost fell off the wall so thats how they got away gorbage said i thought they found some vanishing cream or something together they can do magic chem said as the two reap peared together they have power that no other person in either of your species has for the first time goblins and harpies can compete with the human folk and the centaurs in magic but only together apart you are merely ordinary creatures losing out to the ones who can do magic haggy stared as the couple joined hands again and vanished what i wouldnt give for power like that she screeched faintly would you join with a goblin for it chem asked never dragon on a pedestal whatnevert well but maybe you could see your way clear to let other harpies seek their magic in whatever manner they wished chem said maybe haggy grudged looking as if she were tasting a stinkworm and you chem said turning to gorbage your older daughter married a goblin chief and got a magic wand that makes things fly your younger daughter has the chance to marry a prince and to do magic without the wand would you deny her that well gorbage said looking as if the stinkworm had crawled into his own mouth and what of their offspring chem continued maybe they will combine the best of both species they could be winged goblins able to fly like harpies without sacrificing their legs maybe they will have magic talents by themselves as human folk do maybe they will make your line strong again able to do things no other creatures can do your descendants may once again dominate the land of xanth they may once again achieve greatness will you deny your daughter and your species that chance gorbage scowled i never thought of it that way he was violent and opinionated but he did want what was best for his daughter so why not end the war and give your blessing to the union of these two fine young folk it could be the dawning of a new age for your kind well maybe but the scandal glory jumped up and down clapping her fine little hands thats his way of saying yes she cried and you chem asked haggy i dont have any power over any male of our species the harpy screeched reluctantly im just a common fighting hen which is her way of saying yes hardy said all the old battleaxes are alike if haggy goes along they all will even the queen hen good enough chem said and irene realized she was moving it along so the longtime enemies would not have a dragon on a pedestal chance to change their minds lets declare this interminable internecine war over and be on our way now hold on horsefoot gorbage said wars are not just stopped like that tradition must be upheld of course i realize there will have to be conferences with the other chiefs and formal agreements made chem said but theres no reason not to start i mean there has to be a bash gorbage said and engagements arent just started cold haggy screeched there has to be a big flap we need a whoopdedoo the goblin cried and a poopdepoo the harpy agreed not on my head gorbage said he turned around on the wall and waved to his troops wars over he bawled come on in for the whoopdepoop haggy flew up and screeched similarly to herflock about the doodepoo soon goblins were swarming over the south wall and harpies were flapping over the north wall ready to fling a wingding i hope this is as positive as its supposed to be irene murmured nervously dont worry glory said theyll fling a party like none youve seen that may be what im afraid of yet this was bound to be better than war move it human woman gorbage exclaimed grow some real party plants and make some music haggy screeched you cant match the mouth organ but irene fished for a seed and planted it grow she told it the thing sprouted into a cactus with ridges up the sides and needles in every ridge it brached into a number of shoots some large some small when the plant reached sufficient size it began to tootle what is that grundy asked an organpipe cactus the notes deepened and richened as it continued to grow until at last they were full rich organ sounds dragon on a pedestal well need dancing slippers glory said and hair brushes to pretty up irene grew a moccasin flower a hairbrush cactus and for good measure a necklace plant so people could dress up and refreshments haggy screeched irene grew a pickle weed and perfume the gorgon murmured irene wrinkled her nose agreeing already the air was close with the fetor of the harpies and the goblins were none too clean themselves irene grew several sweetly scented flowers including some drops which were really varieties of rose by other names smelling as sweet and everyone should sign the register hardy said but we dont have a irene grew an autograph tree it had places for everyone to sign and some party stuff grundy said getting into the spirit of it irene delved for some more seeds and grew a fiesta flower a rainbow fem a goodluck plant a silverball plant a pearl plant a liveforever plant a lovecharm plant and a bag flower for the refuse of the party now the enclosure seemed appro priately festive and the scent of the perfume plants was almost overpowering enabling her to ignore the aroma of the harpies move it move it gorbage cried clapping his hands start the bash hardy and glory went to the center of the enclosure where the surface of the water table remained clear except for a layer of carpet grass the organpipe cactus blasted out louder music and they began to dance hardy hovered in midair his wings shining while glory whirled before him again showing her pretty legs irene felt more than a tinge of jealousy once she had had legs like that the two came together wings and skirt swirling like sec tions of the same apparel then flung apart then came together again in a joint swing then they separated completely going to the walls of the enclosure where the spectators were glory skipped across to reach out her hands to her father bringing him grumblingly onto the dance floor she was lovely and he dragon on a pedestal was ugly yet somehow the affinity of lineage was apparent he stomped and she pranced their feet striking the carpet in unison and the dance was good hardy flew to the wall where haggy perched move your tail you abysmal old hen he cried she launched into the air sweeping a dirty talon at him but he spun in place and circled making an orbit about her and shoved her toward the center she screeched an epithet that momentarily darkened the sun but could not truly oppose the will of a male of her species so she spun in air joining the dance as it turned out she did know how the two never touched the ground but matched the beat of the music irene smiled privately it was evident that the bottom of the harpy male hierarchy ranked the top of the female hierarchy haggy screeched her protest but she would have been affronted had hardy chosen any lesser hen to haul in to the dance before her irene had a bright notion she delved for another seed and found what she wanted grow she said flipping it at the north wall where the harpies perched it was a fumigation bush which would quietly clean any harpy in its vicinity she found another and flipped it at the south wall there were now four on or near the floor dancing to the music harpy faced harpy and goblin faced goblin making patterns and it was heartening in the way that any dance was this was indeed becoming a festive occasion then the two couples separated each person going out to fetch in another gorbage went to the wall to insult another harpy into joining them glory brought in another goblin hardy got a new harpy hen and haggy flapped over to challenge a new goblin the four on the dance floor became eight it was a multiplication dance soon the goblins and harpies were all in the dance and several were questing for new partners a goblin came to claim the gorgon who was startled but suffered herself to be drawn forward but i cant see very well she protested faintly through the hood as she went who needs to see the goblin demanded moving into the dragon on a pedestal close ballroom embrace his head coming up just about to her waist you petrify me a harpy came for grundy she simply snatched the golem up and whirled with him in the air irene noticed that her feathers were now clean the fumigation bush was working all the old hens were looking better now that their colors could be seen they really werent as old or ugly as they had seemed though it would not have been fair to call them young or pretty then hardy himself cante for chem we crossbreeds must dance together he said i want to thank you for making a marvelous case finally gorbage came for irene he was half her height and scowling horrendously but he was now clean and ordorless and she could not refuse the war had been convened to a party and she wanted to keep it that way she whirled in the crowd doing her version of the goblin stomp gorbage was a surprisingly good partner for he had a sense of timing and motion for an instant she almost forgot that she was stuck in the jungle hey you got legs like my daughter gorbage remarked and she was embarrassed to find herself blushing want to know something gorbage asked as he stomped in perfect time to the music completely undisturbed about the difference in their sizes when i was dancing with one of those old hens i did some high stepsand i swear my feet left the ground shouldnt they irene asked half bemused by the inno cence of the remark i mean i was flyinga little he said i stayed up for two three beats instead of coming down on one when i touched her i had magic irene paused this was significant are you sure it wasnt just an extra high jump sure im sure maybe but i could only get a little way off the ground without losing my balance and nobody else noticed im an old goblin its too late for me to leam good magic but i guess the horserear was rightwe do have half talents and harpies have the other halves dragon on a pedestal thats amazing irene said this indicated that her private caveat about the significance of hardy and glorys matchup was not well founded the talents did not necessarily align and if a goblin with half levitation encountered a harpy with half invisibilitywell she wasnt sure what would happen then probably nothing so at least to some extent there were proper and improper matchups and hardy and glory were a proper one that was reassuring thats amazing irene said again remembering gorbage its a whole new horizon for your two speciesand a new insight into the nature of the magic of xanth all this time goblins have been fighting harpies when they should have been cooperating so as to discover and use their combined magic now that can change never before has well well see he said i cant say like harpies but i do like magic and especially power you human folk have had it too good too long because of your magic talents maybe now youll have some competition maybe we will irene agreed undismayed this devel opment had provided the warring factions the most powerful incentive to change their ways why try to kill a creature who might enable a person to develop a wonderful new magic talent and if the goblins and harpies no longer warred xanth would be a safer place maybe both these species would become relatively civilized and would join the human and centaur folk as responsible societies irene was really enjoying this wild dance now her dreadful initial vision which had so appalled her at castle zombie was being replaced by a vision of wonderful new things new shapes appeared above the enclosure more harpies were arriving attracted by the noise haggy flew up to screech the glad news at them her wings sparkled now that she was clean and happy she seemed to be a different creature wed better be on our way irene murmured as the dance broke up the day is getting on they managed to make their partings and climbed over the wall haggy presented chem with a whistle made from a hollow dragon on a pedestal feather blow this if you ever need harpy help the old hen said chern accepted it with due appreciation then they were on their way leaving the celebration behind chapter fire and steam i hey had been traveling northeast toward hugos home before encountering glory goblin and veering east hugo did some intelligent mental calculation and concluded that they ought to proceed straight north now to intersect their former route that was better than walking all the way back the way they had come they took it easy pausing to rest and eat so progress was not rapid even so ivy was getting tired by the middle of the day and was wondering whether it would be in order to suggest an afternoon nap period she decided to wait until someone else thought of it they crested a low hill and entered a clearingand were brought up short by a sudden ferocious hiss alarmed they looked about them there switching his tail angrily was a drakea small ornate winged firebreathing dragon they had unwittingly trespassed on his territory and he was not about to let them escape the drake stepped toward them still switching his tail he eyed hugo and ivy then slurped his tongue around his snout obviously hungry maybe we can run away ivy said without much hope the dragon was small but still far larger than stanley dragon on a pedestal flying dragons tended to be lightweights with large wings and they could move much faster than a person could children afoot could never escape the drake however there was a thicket at the side of the knoll the plants were very thick there which was of course why it was called a thickit maybe if we went in there hugo sug gested but though the drake massed much more than they did his body was small in diameter he could furl his wings flat back against his torso so that it was streamlined and he could power his way through the brush in the manner of a snake there was really no escape in the thicket but we cant just let him eat us up ivy protested with some justice on the verge of tears her hand reached for the cyclops bone tied in her hair but halted this was daytime and brontes would not come out of his cave stanley stepped forward huffing steam he was perhaps a quarter the mass of the drake and his wings were inadequate for flight and he had no fire it was plainly a mismatch yet stanley was ready to defend his friends oh stanley ivy cried clapping her little hands i forgot about you of course you can beat the monster the notion was ludicrous yet stanley was ready to try and it became more credible with ivys belief a baby steamer could not hope to oppose an adult firebreather but a baby steamer buttressed by the potent and subtle power of a sorceress could indeed hope but it would have helped had stanley known about the support he had as it was he was indulging in an act of foolhardy courage stanley placed himself between the children and the drake his green body quivering slightly his ears set back against his skull youre so brave ivy said enthusiastically stanleys shud dering stopped his ears perked up and he assumed a more confident stance ivys belief in his courage had enhanced that courage and your scales are so hard and strong she said stanleys scales developed the luster of perfect temper and seemed to be thicker than before dragon on a pedestal and your steam is so hot she continued stanley jetted a shot of steam that fairly crackled as it cut through the cool air and your teeth are so strong and sharp stanley grinned showing surprisingly sturdy and sharp teeth and youre so fast she concluded stanley launched himself at the drake with such suddenness and velocity that the larger dragon was caught still stoking up his furnace before the drake could react stanleys deadly teeth had clamped off the tip of his tail the drake was not one to accept such an indignity lightly he roared sending out a blast of fire that toasted stanleys own tail stanley quickly retreated getting out of the heat fire was not something to be cool about now the fight was on the two dragons paced about the knoll maneuvering for advantage theoretically a chomp on the neck could finish it quickly but al dragons were well armored there and of course it was almost impossible to get in a neckchomp when the enemys head was ready to shoot out a barrier of fire or steam first the heat had to be abated the heat was not limitless a firedrake normally had fuel for only a dozen or so good shots while a steamer soon ran out of water and got dehydrated fighting fire with steam was hard work so neither dragon squandered his resources the trick was to set up the enemy for a telling shot while causing the enemys shots to be expanded uselessly hugo and ivy backed into the thicket watching nervously neither thought of running away while stanley distracted the drake stanley was their friend the drake fired out a whitehot jet stanley swift to react leaped high letting the flame pass beneath him then as he landed and the other was inhaling for another shot stanley wooshed out his own spear of steam it scored on a furled wing and must have been hotter than the drake expected for he jumped back and half unrolled that wing cooling it stanley made another lunge at the tail but this time the drake was ready his head swung about ready to sear stanleys head with flame look out ivy cried stanleys head snapped aboutbut the jet of flame was drooon on a pedestal already on its way all stanley could do was shoot out his own steam a desperate counterattack ivy cringed knowing despite her expressed confidence in stanley that fire was hotter than steam the jet of fire met the jet of steamand just beyond stan leys nose the steam doused the fire a cloud of smoke went up the unbumed fuel of the fire precipitating into a thick haze and slowly the line of their meeting moved away from stanleys nose toward the drakes nose steam was conquering fire the drake broke off the heatduel and dived for stanleys back the jaws gaped and teeth closed above stanleys middle set of legs ivy winced again such a chomp could cripple the little dragon and possibly cut him in half but the toughened scales held the drake could not bite through stanleys hardened armor then stanley rolled over and his claws came up and boxed the drake smartly on the snout making him let go stanley had more legs than the other did so at the moment the advantage was his despite his smaller size they separated again the fight was surprisingly even the drake seemed perplexed ordinarily it should quickly have dis posed of an opponent a quarter its mass but stanley was a rare breed of dragon one of the toughest and orneriest and his power was enhanced by ivys talent he was actually more formidable than he appeared the drake tried a new tactic he unfurled his wings spread them and ascended into the air where stanley couldnt follow he wasnt fleeingflying dragons had little room in their light skulls for brains and what brains they had were cooked by the heat of their own fire so these creatures didnt know when discretion was the better part of ferocity the drake was simply attacking from a new direction he looped about aimed his snout then shot fire down at stanleys head the object was to fry stanleys brains putting him at a slight disadvantage stanley leaped forward trying to escape the fire for he was unable to bend his neck back enough to aim his steam at the enemy above he wasnt geared for an air war but the flame was too fast it scorched his thirdlegs section ivy winced a third time she saw smoke rising from the scales and knew dragon on a pedestal that no matter how hard they were those scales couldnt stop the flesh beneath from getting burned indeed stanley was now limping his tail dragging the drake gave a roar of victory and looped about for another pass oh stanleys hurt ivy screamed feeling the pain herself we must help him but were only children hugo protested reasonably we cant fight a dragon yes we can she insisted stanley needs us youre smart hugo you figure out something now hugo sighed inwardly at the imperatives of women but he was stuck for it he concentrated and discovered again that he was smarter than he thought fruit he said another bright bulb winking into existence above his head chokechemes a fistful of dark red cherries appeared in his hand he pelted the drake with them several cherries bounced off the dragons scales harmlessly even cherry bombs would not have hurt under these conditions but then one landed in the mouth which was just opening for another burst of fire suddenly the drake was choking he coughed sending out a ring of fire and bucked in the air clouds of smoke puffed out of his nostrils and ears and he spun out of control but in a moment he recovered equilibrium and swooped back up before running the risk of crashing in flames a single chokecherry was not enough to bring down a dragon still the distraction had enabled stanley to get himself in order and he was again ready to fight he had found a stone and braced his foresection against it so that his body tilted upward now he could fire steam at the flying enemy but for the moment the drake hovered out of range then becoming extremely smart for his breed he flew down at the far side of the knoll and clutched a smaller stone he hefted this up flew toward stanley dived and let the stone go it was a divebombing attack and stanley had to scramble away from his rock to avoid getting hit stanley needs more help ivy decided hes only a little dragon after all throw some more fruit but not the same kind dragon on a pedestal hugo was ready he conjured a handful of berries and threw them one struck the drake in the tail section as he was picking up the next stone he quacked with outrage and almost flew into a tree but was indignant rather than injured what fruit was that ivy asked surprised gooseberries get something stronger she advised she had never run afoul of that kind of berry but could see that it wasnt enough to put the drake out of commission hugo conjured an alligator pear and hurled it the pear clamped its serrated jaws to the edge of the drakes wing annoying the dragon stronger yet ivy said as the drake reached around to crunch off the paired pear jaws ill try currants hugo said he conjured them and hurled a handful but theyre so small ivy protested just watch she watched one currant fell in the drakes ear another snagged against one of his wings they were alternating cur rants between the two electricity arced shocking the dragon that caused the creature to make a strategic retreat stanley suffused with the spirit of battle pursued the drake dizzy from shock lacked the stability to get fully airborne and scur ried with wings flapping down the far side of the knoll stanley hot on his tail stop stanley ivy cried now we can get away but the little green dragon did not hear her he was hopelessly caught up in the rage of battle this was after all what dragons were made for he continued the pursuit making cute little whomps in order to attain better velocity ivy and hugo followed cresting the knoll the far slope led down to a small islanddotted lake upon whose surface delicate mists played it was very scenic but ivy just wanted to get stanley away from it before he got in trouble one never knew what was in jungle lakes the drake took off and swooped somewhat erratically along through the mist inhaling deeply his control system remained ravaged by the currants but he was recovering he managed dragon on a pedestal to come to roost on the nearest island almost crashing his belly plowed a furrow in the turf and a plume of smoke went up from his tail but he squealed to a halt intact there he rested licking himself off stanley hurried down to the shore where he dipped his snout in the water and refilled his supply he would have plenty of fuel for steam here ivy dashed up to stanley we must leave she cried before the drake recovers but stanley shook his head no he was tired and his hind section was scorched and he still limped but he wanted to finish the fight talk to him hugo ivy pleaded imperiously make him go hugo considered that may not be wise what ivy had trouble assimilating the notion that hugo could side with the dragon against her i think i understand stanleys position hugo said for he retained the smartness ivy had perceived in him before he knows the drake will come after us as soon as he recovers and will attack us from the air as long as the drake has control of the air were vulnerable so we have to stop him now while hes in trouble only then can we travel safely stanley nodded agreement he had a certain insight into the ways of dragons being of that persuasion himself but you cant reach the drake ivy protested directly to stanley hes on the island stanley slid into the water and swam firedrakes didnt like to swim but a steam dragon had to be at home in water his body floated low only the top ridge of scales projecting from the surface along with his eyes and the tip of his snout but there was a stirring elsewhere in the lake look out ivy cried i spy an allegory sure enough the allegory had mistaken the swimming dragon for another of its kind and was hastening to make a comparison ivy had seen a picture of an allegory in her magic coloring book it was green and had a long snout filled with teeth and it lived in the water but it wasnt a dragon it waswell she wasnt quite sure what it was but it was droon on a pedestal stanleys head lifted and turned he saw the allegory and blew out a worried puff of steam he evidently did not know how to deal with a thing like this indeed few living creatures knew how to handle an allegory in its element it was known that an allegory could turn a situation inside out without even touching it that was this entitys magic get away from it hugo cried stanley obeyed swerving toward the shore but a relevant was just coming up to drink the relevant was huge with four trunklike legs and a nose so long it reached right down to the ground naturally that creature liked to poke that nose in other peoples business stanley wanted no part of it and swerved again but now he was traveling toward a hypotenuse who was basking in shallow water the hypotenuse was enormously fat with a huge mouth that opened into a triangle when stanley had turned and proceeded at an angle and then turned to pro ceed at another angle he had taken a line right toward the hypotenuse poor stanley ivy cried hugo you must do something hugo obediently cudgeled his brain again i dont know what fruit can stop monsters like these to make things worse the drake had now recovered he took off and circled ready to fire down at stanleys head stanley would be able to duck under the water but he would not be able to stay down long and the moment he came up that lance of fire would be coming at him ivy was not at all sanguine about the situation after all it was her dragon on her pedestal who was at risk what would she do if anything really awful happened to him hurry up she cried at hugo only you can save him do something fantastic she knew he could because that was the nature of nights in shiny armor prodded by that hugo concentrated and produceda bunch of grapes ivy had terrific confidence in hugo but even she had to harbor a small and unfortunate doubt about this grapes these are the grapes of wrath hugo said proudly i dragon on a pedestal never was able to conjure them before but theyre dangerous to use are you sure the drake was diving toward stanley and the allegory and hypotenuse were closing in use them use them ivy cried we may be sorry hugo said and hurled the bunch of grapes into the lake just as the drake was starting a lance of fire toward stanleys nose stanley ducked his head avoiding the jet but the fire passed through one of the bands of mist the mist ignited converting to flame the flame jumped to another patch of mist then another in a moment there were columns of flame all across the lake the drake flapped awkwardly trying to avoid the flame that appeared in front of him the dragon breathed fire but his wings were not fireproof he dodged the nearest flaming cloud but had to continue swerving to avoid the other flames the drake was no longer concerned with stanley he had his own hide to protect the other creatures were now in trouble too the hypo tenuse quickly submerged hiding from the fire and the alle gory swam swiftly away the relevant trumpeted in fear and charged away from the lake a parody was just flying in it had green wings and a squat downcurving beak wots this wots this it squawked and retreated in haste polly wanna crackup this was not parody country at the moment but the rage of the mists was only the beginning as the grapes of wrath sank into the water the water became furiously agitated it seethed and boiled the surface became rough ripples of emotion traveled across it and soon it was making waves the waves slapped at the fiery mists and the mists heated the waves turning their fringes to steam this interplay only disturbed both forces further and their angry efforts in creased those are strong grapes ivy remarked impressed they come from a mean vintage hugo agreed i had to be sure to get the right ones because if i conjured sour grapes by mistake it wouldnt have worked out very well stanleys in trouble she said the waves dragon on apedestal i told you it was risky i dont know any fruit that would help then find something else she cried hugo looked around ahthere are some string beans growing on the bank we can use them youre brilliant hugo she said and of course he was now they harvested a number of beans and unraveled them each was formed of a balled length of tough stringtoo tough to be cut by any normal knife or bitten through by any normal teeth they twined the strings into a longer even sturdier cord and paid it out into the water hugo used a beanpole to push this cord toward stanley who clamped his teeth on it then they reeled him in and the fierce waves couldnt interfere stanley was all right for he had been able to duck under most of the fires but he was very tired the day was now hot because of all the fire so they retreated from the raging burning lake and sought shade beyond the next hill to rest in it was comfortable here beneath the spreading acom tree and no immediate threats manifested so ivy didnt even need to suggest a rest break they all simply lay down and snoozed ivy lay with her head against stanleys warm side feeling most secure there youre a wonderful dragon for my pedestal she told him youre just perfect and stanley got all steamed up with pleasure ivy was only echoing the kind of sentiment she had been exposed to in her own family but her power extended it in a rather wonderful way time passed quietly like the calm before the storm zzapp ivy woke with a start something had passed close by disturbing her but she didnt see anything she got up she knew there had been something probably only a buzzing bottle fly but she couldnt rest until she had placed it this was her childish curiosity in operation perhaps foolish but quite compelling after all some of those flying bottles could be very pretty zzapp the sound was near the tree she hurried to itand discovered a small hole through its trunk oddshe didnt dragon on a pedestal remember that she could see daylight through it for the hole was perfectly straight or at least only a little wavy she went to the other side there an arms length beyond the trunk hung a little loosely spiraled worm she had seen similar things before usually in the ground or in spoiled fruit so she passed her hand above it to intercept the invisible thread on which it hung but nothing happened she checked all around it to see if there were sidewise strands suspending it but there were none of these either what held it in place she poked the worm with her finger it was mediumhard and fixed in place not moving from her pressure this was more curious yet she got down to put her eye near it zzapp the worm was gone she looked where the sound of it had seemed to go away from her and in a moment found the little worm again hovering in midair farther out from the tree ivy went back and woke hugo youre smart she said come and tell me what i found hugo grimaced he would have preferred to sleep a little longer being intelligent was not all that much fun when he had to keep using his brain to solve difficult problems that was very much like work but he got up and followed her to the place the worm hovered zzapp the worm was gone hugo stared his irritation ripened into horror my father said they were extinct he exclaimed that cute little worm ivy asked she identified with cute things quite properly thats no cute little worm he said emphatically thats a wiggle there must be a swarm a wiggle ivy asked blankly wiggling her torso exper imentally the most terrible menace in xanth hugo explained they destroy everything see this one has holed the acom tree al ready dont stand in front of a wiggle or it will hole you too weve got to get rid of it stanley can steam it ivy said unwomed stanley was now awake and had joined them he sniffed the wiggle in its new location the thing looked like no more dragon on a pedestal than a tiny twisted piece of stem difficult to see at all from any distance steam it hugo cried destroy it the little dragon shrugged and jetted out hot steam the vapor surrounded the wiggle cooking it in place after a mo ment the worm dropped to the ground dead thats a relief hugo said my father says its been thirty years since the last wiggle swarm and he hoped there would never be another he says if the wiggles ever get out of hand it wont be safe for any other creature in xanth ive got to tell him he paused crestfallen but hes a baby now he cant do anything but what do wiggles do ivy asked not quite understand ing she had not been around for the last wiggle swarming nothing i mean all they do is swarm they just travel until they get where theyre going and then they swarm again and everything has holes in it oh ivy didnt want her friends to be holed but we killed it so its all right i dont think so hugo said wiggles always come in swarms and he paused listening zzapp it was the sound of another wiggle there was a swarm all right xanth was in trouble chapter lady gap n uoes your husband swear chem asked irene as they walked on toward the cyclops cave irene was glad to take her mind from the goblin and harpy action just finished dor swear as in bad words of course not why do you ask something the muse mentioned clio is in charge of his tory and she told me how she writes the official history books that cover all of what goes on in xanth but she said theres a lot to do and because history doesnt remain still she can never quite catch up so when the time came to proofread the volume on dors visit to the time of king roogna she had another muse do it then later when clio looked at the book herself she discovered errorstypographical mistakes that werent obvious so the other muse hadnt realized only clio who was conversant with the material perceived those errors but by then the volume had been finalized as she put it and it was too late once a volume has been finalized in parnassus it can never be changed even if its wrong irene had not realized that such a volume existed dor had never spoken of it though she had known about his visit to xanths past and the book said dor swore not exactly it was oni think she said page sixty about ten lines from the topshes very fussy about such details where dor was talking to his sword he was using this big mundane body you knowthat was how he got intothe past by entering the tapestryfigure that was there oregon on a pedestal i know about the tapestry irene exclaimed id like to see that book why theres a copy of it at home the gorgon said she had at last removed the hood and was using her regular veil again humfrey keeps a complete file i read it when it was new fascinating story full of barbarian violence and sex and gross stupidities i love that sort of book hmm irene murmured i begin to comprehend why my husband did not tell me about this i believe ill visit you after our search is over so i can read that story dors in trouble grundy singsonged gleefully i read them all as they appear the gorgon continued there was one about your journey to mundania and another about the ogres and of course there was one about mare imbri i can hardly wait to see how this present business is written up and humfrey mentioned getting an advance notice about a future volume that tells of jordan the ghost and his own visit to the tapestry or something hey i know jordan grundy said he helped imbri beat the horseman in the nextwave siege what about dors swearing irene asked faintly nettled she had thought she knew most of what was important about her husband as i said chem resumed on that page it is reported that his sword tells him he is undoubtedly crazy and dor says well youre in my hand now youll do as i direct or words to that effect thats not swearing irene said you have to have a firm hand with the inanimate or theres no end of mischief dor was simply establishing who was boss but the text recorded it as hell youre in my handan h instead of a w irene grimaced you mean everyone who sees that text will believe my husband swore at his sword im afraid so chem said apologetically it seems a grem lin got into the works and changed it the way gremlins do and because of the circumstances of proofreading oh bother irene said irritatedand wondered whether that would be recorded as an obscenity as the gremlin gen dragon on a pedestal erated more mischief but then she took heart maybe not too many people will see it so it wont do dors reputation too much harm after all never saw it so probably oh yeah grundy cut in i happen to know that someone leaked copies of several of those texts to mundania including that one so a whole bunch of people must have seen it black rage clouded irenes vision but she controlled herself so as not to give the golem satisfaction not too many people who count she amended oh grundy said disgruntled it was true that no one with any sense cared much about the antics of mundanes maybe i shouldnt have brought it up chem said apol ogetically it was only one of a number of cases a number of cases irene cried outraged they dont all involve dor the centaur said quickly the party marched on in silence when they were about half an hour away from the cyclops lair something else in terposed some large creature was whomping through the forest toward them if thats a monster im going to grow a tangle tree irene said fed up with delays if i didnt know better chem remarked id suppose that was the gap dragon its the only creature i know of that moves by whomping along i saw what happened in the magic mirror irene said the gap dragon definitely odd on a fountain of youth water and became tiny this is far too solid a whomping for that yes the gorgon said remembering as she was reminded humfrey and the dragonboth infants now lacuna is baby sitting well it sure sounds like the gap dragon grundy said better be ready to remove your veil stonestare just in case the creature came into sight the gap dragon irene exclaimed it is it indeed it seemed so the dragon was fullsized with bright metallic scales three sets of legs vestigial wings and plumes of steam it spied them and charged shaking the ground with its whomping dragon on a pedestal no time now to marvel at impossibilities irene fished for a seed id better sprout that tangle tree she said or a strangler fig no wait the gorgon protested i remember now hum frey said the gap dragon must not be hurt its needed in the gap irene paused thats right he did say that it made precious little sense to me at the time but now we know the gap dragon helps keep the goblins and harpies apart even if that wasnt the case humfrey always did know what he was talking about before so wed better heed him this time but how can we stop that monster if i dont use my most devastating plants and you dont show your face that question makes me feel very insecure the gorgon admitted grow defensive plants chem suggested worried herself it was one thing to conjecture on the theoretical value of the gap dragon to the society of xanth it was another to watch that monster steaming down on the group until we can slow the dragon down enough so it can listen to grundy then maybe we can find out how it reversed the fountain of youth effect reversed the youth the gorgon exclaimed oh yes we must leam that i can get my husband back to normal she paused considering or maybe partway back id like to know him at a comfortable age of forty or fifty instead of over one hundred the baby dragon was with the children chem said now that it has reverted to adult status i hope it didnt the children irene exclaimed but then her hand found the ivy plant she wore it remained healthy no the children are all right at least ivy is and surely that means hugo is too since they were together surely the gorgon agreed relieved get on with the defensive plants girls grundy cried seeing the dragon bearing down on them it had been making progress all this time but had had some distance to go now it loomed excruciatingly large and fierce the plumes of steam sweeping back along its long body hastily irene selected and threw down a seed grow grow dragon on a pedeital she cried how could she have stood here talking while the monster was charging impelled by the double command the seed fairly burst into growth irene was aware that her power had been slowly fading during her separation from her talented daughter ivy but she still had enough zip for this the plant took firm root developed a thick graywhite stem and spread out a globe of whitish leaves overall it was not large or impressive it was squat and low and showed no thorns or threatening flowers the monsterll crash right through that grundy said ner vously i doubt it irene replied stand directly behind it the four of them placed themselves behind the bush the dragon whomped right at it shooting out a sizzling jet of steam but the steam bounced off the leaves coating them with mois ture they did not wilt surprised the dragon slowed ordinarily it would simply have crushed the bush underfoot but it had learned caution about unusual plants some plants could defend themselves quite adequately it moved into this one at reduced velocity and bounced off it the dragon was shaken the bush re mained undented something odd about this plant chem said understating the case somewhat what is it the gorgon asked impressed one you should recognize irene said a cement plant no i dont know anything about cement plants the gor gon said plants dont have eyes so cant see me so cant be turned to stone by the sight of my face otherwise wed have a handy way to foil the dragon we could hide behind any bush and turn it to stone meanwhile the dragon had figured out that there was some thing funny about the plant and was circling around it steaming angrily irene quickly tossed down several more seeds grow ferns sprouted what can ferns do grundy asked these are chain ferns irene explained in moments the ferns developed metallic links hooked up to each other and formed a sturdy chain barring the dragons progress dragon on a pedestal but the chain was too low the dragon sniffed it pondered for a reasonable interval then simply whomped over it however irene had already started more plants growing several amazon lilies lashed at the dragons feet striking with their small spears of leaves but the reptiles feet were too tough to be hurt by these and progress was hardly impeded but other plants caused more trouble a firecrown landed on the dragons head heating it uncomfortably a fishhook cactus hooked into several toes a mountain rose grew in front rising into a small red mountain blocking the way while it continued to smell as sweet as its cousins by other names a rattlesnake plant rattled hissed and struck at the dragons nose a star cluster heated the dragons scales with a number of little burning stars and scrub oak used little brushes to scrub at exposed anatomy that merely tickled the monster this small stuff is only slowing the thing grundy said you need stronger medicine well i dont have any new seeds sorted yet irene fussed i dont want to risk random seeds the dragon shook off the last of the nuisance plants and fired a jet of steam chem danced aside but irene felt the heat of the blast the golem was right she needed stronger stuff and soon or they would be in deep trouble but a tangle tree was too strong she would have to gamble on some unclassified stock she nerved herself and threw out a random seed grow the seed sprouted into a huge tree that soon made everything else look relatively small oh thats a dwarf yew plant irene said but the dragon simply whomped around it undwarfed she tossed out another it grew a number of cylindrical red fruits and these exploded as the dragon passed startling it a firecracker plant irene said recognizing it a third plant looked like a fern but it soon uprooted itself and walked away walking fern irene said oh im wasting some fine seeds here if only i had time to classify them so i knew what they all were i could do something effective let me talk to them grundy said maybe i can find a good one frustrated but unable to offer anything better irene let the dragon on a pedestal golem put his little hand in the bag of seeds and draw out individual ones to query she hadnt realized he could talk to seeds but of course he could communicate with anything liv ing still this took time for he could only query one at a time and the dragon was close chem kept retreating able to outrun the monster but the gorgon was afoot and having trouble there wasnt room for her on chem along with irene grundy and the bag of seeds she was more solid than zora zombie had been the dragon tended to go for whoever was closest they had to get her out of danger or she would be forced to lift her veil in selfdefense and turn the dragon to stone irene looked anxiously about to the side was the base of a fairly steep slope covered with vegetation that would be easier to hide in there she cried pointing they hurried to the slope chems legs plunged through the layered herbiage seeking firm footing beneath vines and brambles abounded the gorgon had trouble too but maybe irene hoped this would impede the progress of the dragon once it stopped trying to devour them grundy would be able to talk to it chem reached out to grab the gorgons arm helping her to scramble over the slope oops the gorgon cried my veils snagged on a bramble close your eyes irene closed her eyes and looked away just to be safe this was a very poor time to be without sight but such a warning had to be heeded she knew the others were doing likewise she heard the angry hissing of the little snakes that were the gorgons hair they didnt like being shaken up in a moment the gorgon announced that her veil was back in places irene opened her eyes looked backand saw the dragon almost within steaming range grow she cried to the vegetation between them and the dragon it grew oh how it grew the brambles become enormous and twice as tangly as before and the vines threaded themselves into new layers of complexity they twined up around the dragon using it as support for their competitive rising toward the sun in moments the dragon looked like a boulder clothed in vines dragon on a pedestal the reptile didnt like this it thrashed its powerful tail snapping vines as if they were so many cotton threads it steamed making the green leaves wilt it whomped forward flattening multiple layers into one layer the vegetation was no match for it thats one tough dragon irene murmured the toughest chem agreed struggling to stay out of steam range she was panting expending a lot of energy to move up the difficult slope and so was the gorgon i was present when smash the ogre fought it in the gap chasm nine years ago it was an even contest an ogre is stronger than a dragon weight for weight irene said in most cases chem agreed noncommittally the dragon made another whomp now it was within steam ing range it pumped up its body making ready to issue the definitive blast ive got it grundy cried a dragnet seed irene snatched the seed as adeptly as any harpy might have grow she ordered it flinging it at the reptile the seed sprouted in midair it developed into a broad net whose material glinted in the light like steel this was no ordinary plant the net settled neatly over the dragon and dug its fringe roots into the ground on all sides irene had never seen a plant like this before evidently there were some excellent seeds in the batch from the tree of seeds the dragon whomped forward trying to brush the annoying net out of the wayand was thrown back by it no strands broke this was one plant the monster could not overpower by brute force furious the dragon reached out with a leg or two and clawed at the net still it didnt give the dragon blasted out white hot steambut the net did not wilt or melt the dragon chomped on the dragnet with its teeth but the vines held i think weve got it grundy said well talk to it irene snapped this had been entirely too near a thing grundy tried he made a small roaring noise which the dragon on a pedestal dragon ignored they would have to wait for the monster to settle down they waited glad for the chance to rest and slowly the dragons efforts abated soon it would listen to grundy odd the golem remarked innocently i didnt hear you thank me for locating the key seed the dragnet irene stifled further ire at his prodding thank you so deliciously much she snapped but of course grundys part in this had been essential she did have to give credit where it was due even to the most obnoxious person i do so appreciate your gracious grundy began then paused listening zzapp chem stiffened what was that what was what silly filly grundy asked though ob viously he had heard it too probably my imagination the centaur decided for an instant i thoughta historical phenomenon my father chester told me about who cares about history grundy demanded we have a dragon to tame im not sure the gorgon said my memory remains vague in certain areas but i remember humfrey once describing a really bad threat zzapp now the dragon froze its ears perking up saythat dragon has two ears grundy exclaimed so it does chem agreed that cant be the gap dragon smash the ogre smashed off one of its ears we used that ear to tune in on danger there are two gap dragons irene asked perplexed ill ask the golem said he made another small steamy roar now the dragon roared back astonished grundy translated shes not our dragon she irene asked grundy exchanged more roars shes the female of the species she comes every so often to mate with the gap dragon using a secret entrance to the gap he doesnt know about dragon on a pedestal so she supposes chem put in once the forgetspell started breaking up he remembered that exit and the trouble started this time when she arrived he was gone so she set out in search for him she can wind him from afarbut hes elusive no wonder chem said hes rejuvenated tell her that no cure for the fountain of youth then the gorgon said sadly if this had been the restored gap dragon grundy told the lady gap dragon she reacted with reptilian horror balls of steam drifted from her ears she wants to know how we expect her to mate with a baby grundy re marked with a smirk i wish i knew the gorgon said zzapp again the dragon reacted grundy inquiredand his little face sagged with horror shes heard that sound before she says its a wiggle a wiggle chem said my dread has been realized the worst possible threat to xanth yes now i remember the gorgon agreed this is ter rible irene was perplexed i think ive heard the term but dont really know anything about it whats so bad about a wiggle zzapp chem spotted two chunks of wood in the brush on the slope picked them up and stalked the sound while she talked the wiggles are tiny spiral worms that swarm periodically some times a century passes without an infestation sometimes only a few decades the last swarming was just about thirty years ago my great uncle herman the hermit supervised the effort of containment and lost his life in the process it was hoped that the wiggle scourge had been permanently eradicated but it seems not now we shall have todo the job overand immediately but all i heard was a little zap irene said whats wrong with that that was the sound of the wiggle moving the centaur dragon on a pedestal explained it hovers in place for perhaps a minuteits var iable or perhaps each individual worm has its own typical frequencythen zips forward in a straight line a variable distance but not far at a time it zzapp oopsits the dragnet chem said grundy quickly explain to the female gap dragon but the dragoness had been paying close attention to the zaps she had evidently been around for the last wiggle swarm ing or perhaps the one before that and knew how to deal with wiggles she pounced on the tiny worm that appeared near her crunching it in her teeth then she spat out the remains making a lugubrious face they taste terrible i understand chem explained but they can be crushed to deathif caught at the right moment she grimaced grundy see if we can work things out with the dragoness i fear we have a problem thats bigger than any of us the golem started talking to the netted creature who listened attentively so the wiggles travel in zippy lines irene said irritated by her evident ignorance of something important whats wrong with that why kill an innocent flying worm thats just minding its own business its the way they travel chem explained they go through things they leave holes when they go through air a vacuum is left behind the zzapp is the sound of that tunnel of vacuum collapsing when they go through trees the wood is punctured when a person is in the way i begin to understand irene said shuddering and theres no way to stop them only by killing them chem said their bodies are tough yet can be crushed i was going to squish this one between the pieces of wood but the lady gap dragon chewed it instead its also good to put a wiggle between a rock and a hard place however this was only one wiggles never travel singly theyre always part of a swarm of thousands radiating out from a central nest we must find and destroy that nest and must eradicate every individual wiggle who has already departed dragon on a pedestal from it because any one of them can get to where its going hibernate for decades then form a new nest and swarm again no one knows precisely what a wiggle is doing between swarms but the life pattern of its species seems to resemble its individual onemostly stasis punctuated by sudden calamitous move ment if too many wiggles escape the next swarming could consist of many nests in different locations and all those zapping worms punching through plants and animals and people could threaten much of the rest of life in xanth irene concluded now at last i have caught up with you we must organize a campaign for extermination we must indeed chem agreed im afraid this preempts our search for ivy and hugo for now all of xanth is threat ened ivy and hugo irene exclaimed stricken my vision the terrible unseen threatthis is it the gorgon was equally horrified if they are headed to ward the swarm not knowing yet we cannot ignore the swarm itself chem insisted if we pursue the children now the wiggles could overrun xanth and be entirely out of control the greater good re quires dont try to use reason on a worried mother grundy said ill do both irene said resolutely i wont let either xanth or my child be doomed but how can we best fight the wiggle menace all the creatures of the region must be summoned to help chem said each must stomp or chew or otherwise crush or dispose of one wiggle at a time its a tedious and dangerous chore for anyone near a wiggle swarm is apt to get holed but there is no other way and it must be done rapidly because more wiggles must be pouring out of that nest every moment and they dont wait for anything except their own mysterious imperative how anyone can reach the nest without getting hopelessly holed is problematical but it must be attempted the female dragon understands grundy announced shes been around a long time shes seen wiggles before shell help fight them will she stop chasing us if we free her the gorgon asked dragon on a pedestal the golem growled at the dragoness how did they eradicate the last nest irene asked in the interim i believe they got a salamander to start a magic fire the centaur said the fire bumed inward in a constricting circle destroying them all but our chance of finding a salamander in time to do the job is not good theyre very rare and private creatures i can grow a flamevine irene said no only magic fire will do it as i understand it the centaur said ordinary fire might get a few but could also bum out of control salamander fire bums anything and every thing which regular fire doesnt but it is also oneway so it is selflimiting both qualities are essential otherwise we would do more harm than good the dragoness says shell spare us grundy reported she was after us only because she was hungry shes been so busy searching for her mate she forgot to eat i understand perfectly the gorgon said tell her well help her find her mate if she helps us now but tell her also about the youthening her mate is with my child irene said our missions coincide she agrees but shes very hungry that was a problem it was not safe for anyone to keep company with a hungry dragon i can grow beefsteak tomatoes for her irene offered she fished out a seed grow the plant burst into growth and soon fruited the dragoness grabbed the beefsteaks as the gorgon plucked them and tossed them to her irene found an acid seed and planted it near the rooted edge of the dragonet the acid ate into the net dissolving the strands and soon the lady gap dragon was able to crawl out zzapp let me go after this one the gorgon said she followed the sound located the worm and put her face close to it then she lifted her veil while the others averted their eyes grundy warned the dragoness who also looked away dragon on a pedestal the worm fell like a little stone it worked the gorgon cried dropping her veil back into place i can stone them just watch you dont try it when ones about to zap grundy warned youd get holed through your face ill be careful the gorgon promised very well irene said lets start organizing this as i see it we have three things to do we have to fight the wiggles here rescue the childrenall three of themand alert the rest of xanth to the crisis i think we can do all three at once by splitting up our party gorgon why dontyou and the lady gap dragon work together here stoning wiggles she can carry you rapidly to and away from them so youll have the situation under control and you can stone all the wiggles you meet you can work better without the rest of us because i understand the gorgon said i dont want a crowd of people around when i lift my veil but what about the dragoness quest for the real gap dragon chem asked if she helps fight the wiggles here that will free the rest of us to continue our search for the children picking up their trail at the cyclops cave irene explained if we find the little dragon with ivy and hugo as it seems we should grundy can tell him where to find the female dragonso that will be all right she nodded to herself you know it becomes more plain why humfrey said to preserve the gap dragon there are interactions out here in the wilderness that we know little of but that can relate intimately to the welfare of all xanth the total ecology chem agreed we ignore it at our peril everything relates grundy explained to the dragoness who nodded she well understood the need and recognized that irenes party could do a better job of tracking down the children more quickly than she herself could now that the edge had been taken off her hunger she was a reasonable creature soon she and the gorgon moved off the dragoness keen ears perked for more zaps dragons ears were very special she would locate more wiggles more rapidly than the others could now for the reinforcements irene said grundywe need you for translations but now i think we need even more dragon on a pedestal to get the word out about the wiggles if we encounter the rejuvenated gap dragon before you rejoin us well try to communicate with him somehow maybe ivy has found a way ill grow an airplane plant you can ride to parnassus so you can tell the simurgh im sure the big bird will take it from there then you can return to us the simurgh doesnt permit others to fly over parnassus grundy protested its a risk youll have to take try to give your message the moment she sees you then it should be all right shes a pretty smart bird and remember she can read your mind so you can think loudly as you approach wiggle wiggle smart bird grundy repeated wanly chem chuckled smart bird the simurgh was the most knowledgeable birdand creatureof all time you will do it irene demanded seeing his reluctance grundy grimaced yes ill try irene grew the airplane plant it sprouted stiff wings an upright tail and an airscope that sucked in air heated it and fired it out the rear jetting itself forward the plant wasnt large enough or strong enough to support any normal person but grundy was no normal person he boarded the plane and it took off with a whoosh of fumes he was able to guide it by shifting his weight wiggle wiggle he cried now lets get on to the cyclops cave irene said to chem we have a good notion of its location if we hear any wiggles on the way we can destroy them and lets hope grundy rejoins us in time to translate for the cyclops we must tell him of the wiggle menace and ask him where ivy is there are no normal enemies during a crisis like this chem galloped irene was tense and worried yet she ex perienced a certain exhilaration whatever threat the wiggle menace was it certainly wasnt dull chapter wiggle wiggle weve got to do something ivy said we can get stones or rocks and squish the wiggles as we find them hugo said but i think there are too many for us zzapp here hugo said conjuring two rockfruits use these to smash it ivy took the fruits which fitted comfortably in her little hands and stalked the wiggle she found it and smashed the rocks together ugh squish she said wrinkling her nose as she inspected the result its the only way hugo said conjuring two more fruits for himself my dad says you can only really stop wiggles by destroying their nest but anyone who gets close to it gets holed by the wiggles he says thats how the invisible giant died he was a big big man but the wiggles played eighteen holes in him and he crashed poor giant ivy said sympathetically i never saw him no one ever saw him dummy he was invisible so we just have to catch the wiggles as they come zzapp zzapp oops theyre coming faster now ivy said they do hugo agreed and they radiate out in a big circle that gets bigger and bigger maybe we better run no ivy said we must destroy the nest but i told you we cant get close to it well figure out how she snapped imperatively she was dragon on a pedestal not aware of it but at this moment she resembled her mother quite strongly and not merely for the tint in her hair youre smart enough this was of course an unfair assumption but hugo was used to it by now he concentrated it was amazing how smart he became when she insisted well we cant just walk up to it cause wed get holed unless stanley could keep steaming ahead and cook them in a channelbut no hed soon run out of water we dont know how far away that nest is it could be several hours travel since nothing we know of can shield against the bore of a wiggle any direct approach is doomed to failure hugo was sounding more intelligent than ever before in his life except when he served as defender at hardy harpys trial in fact at this moment he resembled his father even stanley who really didnt have much truck with intelligence sat up and took notice but ivy wasnt impressed she wanted results not dialogue figure out a way she insisted you can do it if you really tryi know you can if we got there hugo said i suppose stanley could steam the nest and cook the remaining wiggles so the only problem is transportation now as i understand it the wiggles radiate out on a plane that is they move out in a flat circle not a sphere they dont go up or down just sideways so it should be possible to approach the nest from above or below below is no good for we cant tunnel through rock but abovei wonder whether stanley could fly there ivy liked this notion which really was an excellent one stanley youve got wings she exclaimed so you can fly cant you the little dragon spread his wings and flapped them he raised some dust and caused a gentle breeze but could not get off the ground come on stanley ivy said encouragingnly i just know you can do it try harder in response the dragon pumped harder his wings seemed to become larger and fuller and better webbed for a moment his body lifted then it spun out of control and he plopped to dragon on a pedestal the ground ivys power it seemed had finally reached its limit hes not a flying dragon hugo pointed out those wings are vestigial if he flew hes probably crash and hurt himself ivy considered that she didnt want stanley to hurt himself she was very solicitous about pain then find another way to fly she told hugo hugo concentrated again i can conjure fruitflies he said in his hand appeared a peach fruitfly it had fuzzy pink skin and two green leaves that flapped like wings he released the peach and it buzzed up and away can they carry stanley no they can only carry their own weight indeed the peach was already laboring for its leafwings were wearing out obviously it was not a powerflier then find another way ivy said insistently youre smart you can do it i know you can hugo sighed intelligence was a mixed blessing but he did privately enjoy being considered smart and now he had become smart enough to realize how her talent worked he could con jure good fruit because she believed he could he was becoming handsome because she saw him that way he was intelligent because she insisted that he be so she was a little sorceress without her he would once more be nothing he was in a subtle but compelling manner dependent on her and he wanted very much to please her but he knew they could not safely fly to the wiggle nest was there some other approach he cudgeled his brain but all it told him was that he had no answer how could he arrange to accomplish the impossible this group of three children simply lacked the resources to exterminate the wiggles zzapp ill get it ivy said grasping her rockfruits you keep thinking she stalked the wiggle zzapp there was another stanley went after it hugo noted idly that the two wiggles seemed to be traveling on slightly divergent paths immediately his heightened intel lect reasoned it out naturally the paths diverged for the wig dragon on a pedestal gles were radiating out from a common source the farther they traveled the greater their separation from each other be came it was an elementary matter to triangulate and estimate the location of the source which really was not far from here he and ivy and stanley could reach it readilyif they had any means of keeping from getting holed on the way he conjured a bunch of grape fruitflies and watched them fly most of them were smaller than the peach and deep purple their leafwings were much larger in proportion which made them stronger fliers a few were the opposite being larger than the peach and bright yellow with little leaves they could not fly well at all it all depended whether they were grape fruitflies or grapefruit flies their differences in flying ability were a matter of elementary physics which was the science of magic that hugo was now beginning to comprehend but the absolute weight that the small grapes could carry was no larger than that of the peach by no stretch could the grapes support the weight of the little dragon well perhaps if hugo could conjure grapesofwrath fruit flies no that was definitely unsafe several of the grapes spun dizzily and fluttered to the ground they did not seem tired merely confused others were unaf fected why was this hugo conjured a bunch of cherries these had smaller but firmer leaves and flapped more vigorously than the loose leafed grapes so they were actually stronger fliers they pur sued the grapesand several of the former spun out of control in the same place the grapes had ivy returned her rocks smeared with ick we got em she reported with satisfaction the gist of a notion flirted with hugos consciousness the fruitfliesthe wigglesthere was some connection yet he couldnt pin it down but he was smart enough to ask for the help he needed ivy make me smarter yet he told her make me superbrainyintelligent ivy like women of any age did not properly appreciate the nature of her power of course youre superbrainlyintelli gent she said youre the smartest person in all xanth dragon on a pedestal just know it and so she believed now that she thought of it nights in shiny armor were supersmart werent they and because she was a sorceress and had power that only good magician humfrey would have believedhad he not been a babywhat she believed was mostly true hugo became al most too smart to be credible the fruitflies he said working it out they are being affected by an unseen agency that causes them to lose their orientation without physically damaging them see there go some more cherries cherries ivy exclaimed alarmed no these are cherry fruitflies not cherry bombs he clarified these fly they dont explode oh goody she relaxed but the disorientation effect is localized there seems to be a region through which the fruits can not safely pass and the nature of that region judging from other small hints we have had must bea forgetwhorl of the kind my father described before he regressed to infancy is that bad ivy asked impressed yes and no it is bad for us for we must avoid it had we blundered into it we should have suffered immediate amnesia he knew about the whorls because he had been along when good magician humfrey had told king dor about them back in castle zombie with his present genius he grasped their nature thoroughly however we should now be able to use this whorl for our purpose since it should have the same effect on the wiggles that it does on the fruits this is not a certainty but is a high probability all we need to do is move that whorl over to the wiggle nest and it will cause the worms to forget their purpose and perhaps forget even how to move then their menace will likely abate wonderful ivy agreed lets move it we cant even see it hugo pointed out now experiencing the necessary caution of a smart person and the thing is dangerous it can wipe us out too as surely as if it had giant teeth how can we move it you can figure out a way she said encouragingly hugo sighed somehow he had known she would say that dragon on a pedestal he concentrated again it seems there are a number of whorls drifting generally southward from the weakening forgetspell on the gap chasm they seem to have changed their nature causing total forgetting instead of just gap chasm forgetting i could probably work out a rationale for that effect stick to business ivy said firmly hugo sighed again these whorls seem to associate loosely with the gap dragon or his rejuvenated state perhaps because his exits from the gap are through a convenient channel convenient for the whorls as well as for the dragon presumably the dragon is at least partially immune to the effect of the forgetspell having spent all his life within it so it may be no coincidence that there is a whorl in this vicinity but this suggests two thingsthat the whorls are to some extent af fected by the prevailing winds and the lay of the land and that stanley may have more influence over them than other creatures do if we assume this is true stanley should be able to move a whirl by fanning it with his wings and blowing along natural channels in the terrain ivy clapped her hands i just knew you could do it hugo she cried joyously now tell me what you said hugo translated we can blow the whorl to the wiggle nest oh goody lets do it they did it after some further discussion and organization hugo explained that they should be safe from the onzapping wiggles if they kept the whorl between them and the nest for the wiggles would forget their purposeassuming his conjec tures were correctwhen they entered the whorl and would be of no further threat the three of them would have to stay together not venturing out to destroy individual wiggles as it would not be safe anywhere but behind the whorl and ivy and hugo had to stay behind stanley because while the whorl might not hurt the dragon it would erase the two of them if it touched them this was a rather tricky dangerous business but ivy was not a creature of caution she knew the wiggle nest had to be nullified so she was bound to do if her mother would have had another vision worse than the first had she known what was contemplated here dragon on a pedestal they proceeded stanley was in the lead using his wings to fan the whorl he could not fly but he could generate a gentle steady breeze that made the whorl slowly drift away it did seem to respond to his breeze more than to the incidental passing natural breezes hugo was at the rear conjuring bunches of flying cherries that he sent around and into the invisible whorl the cherries that spun out of control showed where the whorl was that was the only way it could be spotted ivy stayed between stanley and hugo enhancing both their powers it might have looked to an outsider as if she were doing nothing but without her hugo assured her neither he nor stanley would have been able to perform both dragon and boy had enhanced intelligence and powers in her presence the pedestal and the shiny armor needed constant tending now hugo continued to triangulate the location of the nest by listening to the zaps of passing wiggles and performing rapid mental calculations the zaps became more prevalent as prog ress was made but it was not possible to approach the nest in a straight line for there were trees and boulders in the way and a hill that the whorl tended to slide away from and a pond too deep for them to wade through so they had to travel the contour which meant moving the whorl sidewise on occasion this was a challenge stanley could blow the whorl directly forward but sidewise travel meant he couldnt do that the wiggles were zapping thickly out from the nest preventing stanley from moving to the side he might be immune to the effect of the whorl but he wasnt proof against the wiggles they were stuck ivy of course had the answer figure it out hugo she cried cowering as the zapping of wiggles became close and loud zzapp zzapp zzapp how can stanley blow around a comer hugo cudgeled his brain yet again blow around a comer ridiculous only if he had a baffleand he had no way to get one there were half a dozen close zaps every minute now he would be holed in short order if he ventured from the shelter of the whorl as it was he had to watch his flying fruits carefully because a number were getting shot down by the dragon on a pedestal wiggles if he misread the position of the whorl by confusing holed fruit with forgetted fruit disaster could follow then it came to him vectors he cried another menace ivy asked alarmed no vectors are lines of force he explained my father the baby was reading about them in a mundane text once while he was babysitting me before he got infanted himself hugo paused smiling now i can babysit him if i ever get home then he returned to his concept vectors are one of the types of magic that work in mundania stanleys breeze represents one vectorpushing the whorl straight forward toward the next the slope of the hill is another vector pushing the whorl back the vectors oppose and therefore we cant make prog ress but the slope isnt straight back its a little sidewise so if we blow forward and the hill pushes a little to the side the net resulting force will be to the side im glad youre smart ivy said dubiously it doesnt make any sense to me ill show you stanley blow forward steadily the little dragon flapped his wings blowing forward at the whorl the whorl moved a little as shown by the falling cher ries then nudged to the right as the blowing continued the whorl moved faster rightward its sliding to the side ivy exclaimed surprised precisely hugo agreed this is slow but effective as we make progress around the hill the vectors will change and well make better progress we shall reach the nestin due course it happened as he had foreseen the curve of the hill made progress gradually easier in addition they discovered that by angling stanleys breeze slightly they could cause the whorl to roll or spin some affecting its progress they were getting better at this but the extent of the wiggle menace became evident as they rounded the hill and cut across the depression beyond it ivy looked back and saw the entire hill riddled by wiggle holes trees were tattered and a few had fallen their trunks so badly holed they collapsed what an appalling number of wiggles dragon on a pedestal hugo glanced back too good thing we didnt try to fly he remarked why because now i see that a number of wiggles do after all travel upward he said the holes do not form a perfectly horizontal plane most holes are in a level line but some are above and below some wiggles are angling upward or down ward and probably a few go straight up if stanley had tried to fly over the nest he would probably have been holed so many times before he reached it that he never would have made it oooh awful ivy agreed with a shudder zzapp zzapp zzapp now she was even more conscious of the concentration of wiggles they were everywhere except right here and the landscape of xanth was devastated by their passage she could see dead animals and birds holed by wig gles even the ground was chewed up by frequent holing the wilderness was becoming a wasteland but now at last the nest itself was in sight it was a dark globe as tall as a grown man perched on the ground beyond a ravine there was a haze around it which ivy realized was actually the mass of wiggles hovering in the region before zapping on outward most of them did hang in a plane parallel to the ground making the nest resemble the planet saturn but of course this was much larger than saturn which as every one knew was only a tiny mote in the night sky that never dared show itself by day overall the thing was awesome and horrible how unfor tunate no one had seen it while it was growing and destroyed it before the swarming started but this was in the deepest depths of unknown xanth where no one who was anyone ever went so the nest had grown and grown unmolested perhaps over the course of thirty years now xanth was paying for it it had taken time to skirt the hill and guide the forgetwhorl this far they were tired for all three of them were children and the day was fading still there should be time to reach the nest except hold up hugo cried we cant go there ivy saw what he meant the ravine was no minor cleft it dragon on a pedestal was an abrupt deep fissure in the earth extending down into darkness it was too broad for any of them to jump across and too deep to climb through to the sides it leveled out somewhat at the near edge but the far edge remained an almost vertical cleft as far as they could see they could certainly roll the whorl into this ravinebut if it sank to the bottom they could never get it out again they halted afraid to go farther lest the whorl fall in what are we to do now ivy asked dispiritedly she was a creature of optimism and she believed in her friends but the blank far wall of the ravine was a mighty pessimistic thing let me think hugo said while hugo thought ivys tired attention wandered she wished she were home at castle roogna watching the historical tapestry with its perpetually changing pictures she could al most picture herself there happily absorbing the yams of the tapestry suddenly she spotted a faint horseoutline she recognized it the day mare she exclaimed i see you mare imbri youre such a pretty black just like a shadow and as tended to happen in ivys presence the object of her attention became more so imbri the day mare who had brought ivys daydream became clearer and blacker and pret tier she was now more perceptible than she had been hey she can take a message to our folks hugo said his intelligence still operating we need advice about what to do now but the mare shook her head sadly her shadowmane flar ing she projected her thought into a dream figure of a nymph and ivy heard the nymphs voice faintly in her head like a distant memory night is nigh and i can no longer carry dreams by night i can not carry messages from one person to another i can only bring thoughts oeach other i will have time only to hint to your folks where you are and imbri was off racing against the suddenly looming night ivy shook her head they were still stuck they wouldnt be able to see the flying cherries in the dark and so the whorl would drift away and then the wiggles would come through dragon on a pedestal what were they to do their gallant effort was about to collapse into disaster they didnt even have time to retreat or any way to bring the protective whorl with them if they did withdraw chapter community effort i hey found the cyclops cave in late afternoon the monster was asleep inside with the bones of a recent carcass piled in the entrance irene would have felt dread for the fate of her daughter but the ivy plant she carried still grew in health ivy remained wellsomewhere be ready irene warned chem im going to broach the monster the centaur nocked an arrow to her bow and stood ready irene approached the cave cyclops she called the creature stirred ungh he inquired through a yawn who calls brontes so the thing could speak the human language good where is my daughter irene demanded the cyclops sat up his big blue eye gazed out into the light he saw chems arrow aimed at that eye he blinked daughter ivy she was with a little dragon the cyclops brightened sure her and the dragon and the boy nice visit good fruit friends all three are safe sure nice children we talk tell stories but they not dragon on a pedestal where are they now irene asked evenly for her trust in monsters was small they go home the cyclops said that way he pointed northeast but thats through the deepest depths of the unknown irene protested and she added to herself it was not the di rection of the mouth organ where the children had interacted with the goblin band was brontes deceiving her yes nice kids i say i carry them at night but they not wait in hurry go home they were all right when they left here irene asked still uncertain this misalignment of direction bothered her once again compulsively she glanced down at her ivy plant of course the children were all right they not wait for night i not go out by day the sky chem lowered the bow i dont think hes deceiving us she said he wouldnt be in a position to know about the goblins the children must have changed direction when they encountered glory irene agreed the cyclops story did after all align what about the sky my father the skyhe strike me down if your father is in the sky chem asked approaching is this a euphemism for he banish me will strike down so you said chem cut in so your father is the sky and hes angry with you how long ago did you offend him the cyclops was at a loss he started counting on his huge fingers that many years ago irene asked centuries the cyclops said starting on his other hand centuries chem exclaimed your kind must live a long time brontes shrugged sip of youth water now and then spring not far for me but not live long if i go out in sight of sky it was amazing how widespread knowledge of the fountain of youth was among the creatures of xanthwhile civilized people had remained ignorant yet this creature seemed un dragon on a pedestal necessarily restricted by his fear of the sky have you ever tested it thisthis continuing animosity not dare go out by day look irene said impatiently there is a terrible hazard facing xanth at the moment and we need all the help we can get have you heard of the wiggles the wiggles brontes exclaimed many times since time began very bad theyre swarming again if you dont come out and help us stop them they may riddle this cave by nightfall theyre harder to fight at night because you cant see them as well so you may have to choose which chance to takesky or wiggle must warn brothers brontes cried steropes and arges are also at risk only found them last night irene wondered why the cyclops hadnt found his brothers before perhaps when the last wiggle swarm had passed this way but probably they had been fighting different sections of the swarm then retreated to their caves by day the way brontes did these semihuman creatures had funny values do that she said but first you must come out of that cave but the sky forget the sky irene snapped come out here and see what happens if you dont get struck down youll know its safe its been a long time after all the monsters big eye brightened true long time he put a foot out of the cave then hesitated as if thinking of something else but if sky do strike then you wont have to worry about the wiggles overcome by this logic though it seemed he reserved some small doubts the cyclops stepped out of his cave cowering against the light afraid a thunderbolt would strike him down but as the sunlight fell on him nothing else did evidently the sky has forgotten you chem said brontes peered up shading his eyes with a hand amazed and relieved long time he repeated oh now i free my brothers too all fight wiggles he glanced about not see as well as when ivygirl help where are wiggles roughly eastnortheast of here we think chem an dragon on a pedestal swered we skirted the fringe of the swarm and havent pinpointed it yet but its not very far awayand getting closer all the time the kids he said going right into it then he charged off to the west in quest of his brothers hes right irene said with new alarm the children must be very near that swarm lets hurry they hurried irene wished grundy were still with them for now the trail was fresh and the local plants would be able to confirm the route but she could not wait for the golem to reappear the threat of the wiggles made haste imperative as she rode irene began to daydream this was unusual for her as she was a practical woman she had to make sure dor didnt innocently foul up the kingdom but now at this time of the double tension of peril to her child and to all of xanth she found herself dreaming she must be more tired than she thought she remembered how she had participated in the defense of xanth from the last great threat that of the mundane next wavewhich was of course now the lastwave but old thought and speech habits died slowlyand had herself been king for a while since xanth did not have ruling queens the final key to victory had been imbri the night mare now honored by a commemorative statue who had given her physical life in the cause and now was a spirit of the day a day mare bring ing mare imbrium irene exclaimed abruptly its you and of course it was now she could see the faint shadow outline of her friend running beside chem i thought you knew chem said imbri joined us several minutes ago im not as alert to her as you are irene said disgruntled you share your soul with her true chem agreed but it is you she has the message for except that she doesnt want to call it that well lets have it irene cried by whatever name now she was fully alert and the day mare couldnt com municate with her directly chem had to translate for the centaurs soulaffinity gave her a special understanding dragon on a pedestal imbri says hugo and ivy and stanley are safe but stanley remember glory and hardy told us the rejuvenated gap dragon they are safe but need help theyre going after the wiggle nest directly thats impossible irene protested no one can approach a wiggle nest so we thought chem agreed but imbri says they are using a forgetwhorl as a shield and plan to use the whorl to wipe out the nest we must promise not to reveal that she told us this because shes not supposed to i promise irene exclaimed but howa forget whorl believe that could be effective chem said if the whorl does to the wiggles what it does to most creatures they will forget how to zap and cease to be a danger to the rest of xanth i suspect this is a stroke of genius though how they ever thought of it no one can even see a whorl irene protested it is amazing chem agreed imbri says hugo is locating the whorl by using flying fruit but ail hugos fruit is rotten not any more not according to glory goblin or brontes the cyclops imbri merely confirms that hugo has perfected his talent and is now a good deal smarter and handsomer than before a woman has to be responsible or a little girl irene agreed i keep forgetting how much power ivy seems to be manifesting and the little dragon is fanning the whorl forward with his wings but the gap dragons wings are vestigial theyre hardly noticeable they cant they seem to have grown i suspect your daughter has something to do with that too the rest of the light dawned only the talent of a sorceress could account for all the changes we have noted a sorceress chem agreed she was perhaps too close to you so you didnt realize ivy will one day be king of xanth dragon on a pedestal when my generation passes irene murmured awed by the vision of it this was more than she had hoped for then common sense prevailed three children cant take a risk like that irene said we cant allow it those wiggles are the most deadly menace in xanth weve got to get them out of there we cant chem said imbri reports the wiggles are so thick where the children are that no one else can approach but all we can do is fight the wiggles where we encounter them and hope that ivy and her friends get through by them selves but ivys only three years old and a sorceress irene stifled her reply as it could only have debased a long friendship and would not have rescued her threatened child she wanted a live daughter not a dead sorceress they had been moving along rapidly covering much more distance in an hour than the children could have done guided by mare imbris indication of the location of the children irene knew they were now very close they reached a grassy knoll there stood a small flying dragon a drake somewhat bedraggled chem whipped her bow forward arrow nocked she knew better than to take any dragon for granted if the drake launched itself in her direction she would send a shaft through its eye before it got fairly aloft irene also reached for a seed its effect would be slower than chems arrow but as potent in the long run zzapp chem and irene froze trying to locate the wiggle the drake lifted its head spied the worm and bathed it in fire the burned husk dropped to the ground i think were on the same side chem said but she kept her bow ready we have intersected the swarm irene said with a sinking sensation and we havent caught up to ivy and imbri says we wont the children are ahead very close to the nest itself a short distance geographically but an dragon on a pedestal immense one in the practical sense we must fight the wiggles here and hope for the best zzapp irene dismounted perturbed i suppose so but i dont like it those children chem found two stones and clapped them together exper imentally you have to crush them hard she said and quickly were going to be very busy now irene dropped a seed grow she said in a nononsense tone the seed sprouted into a hairy toad plant the hairy toads goggled their eyes about looking for bugs snap up the wig gles irene told the plant the toads grimaced and threatened to croak apparently knowing how bad wiggles tasted but seemed ready to obey irene found stones of her own and waited for the next zap chem was right there was nothing else to do at this stage she had done most of what she could do when she sent grundy off to notify parnassus now they just had to hold the fort as it were until competent help came the incidence of wiggles increased the swarm was ex panding and it was obviously a large one chem and irene found themselves retreating they had to stay abreast of the outer perimeter for any single wiggle that got past could start a new nest in due course yet irene knew they were dealing with only one tiny part of what had become a huge circle the wiggles were moving out everywhere not just here we need help irene ex claimed a lot of help and soon imbri has gone to notify king dor chem said stalking a wiggle shes decided this is so important she can justify breaking the rule about day mares and communications and how fast will dor be able to get here it will be nightfall before this campaign gets truly organized and then we wont be able to see the wiggles chem finished and by morning theyll be spread so far well never get them all i suspect that at some stage some of them drop out stop zapping and settle down to hibernate we have very little chance dragon on a pedestal to catch those so the battle may well be lost by morning even if we do exterminate every wiggle thats still zapping we can only hope grundy gets help from the simurgh if only we could summon others here directly irene ex claimed we she paused im a fool we can didnt haggy harpy give you a whistle chem cried how could i have forgotten that she brought out the feather whistle and blew a resounding blast on it the harpies will be able to notify the goblins too and perhaps put out the news on the mouth organ there was a shuddering of ground behind them three huge cyclops clomped up brontes had found his brothers and come to help spread out irene called each person take a section and destroy any wiggles that pass through it weve got to get as many as we can before it gets too dark to see them we see well in dark brontes told her bless you irene cried relieved this was a really useful contingent now there were five of them and they were holding up the advancing line despite the thickening of wiggles each cyclops had a huge club with which he bashed each wiggle into goo irene had never dreamed she would be so happy to be so near such frightful monsters performing such violence the ground rocked with their blows but every crash meant another small victory it still wasnt sufficient the wiggles were getting thick enough to represent a real danger to the people for anyone standing in the path of a traveling wiggle would be holed perhaps fatally so far the folk had stood out beyond the fringe of the main swarm running up only to smash the wiggles they spotted but that was not efficient if a person stayed within the fringe he could smash only two or three in the time he otherwise smashed onebut how long would he last a huge creature glided in for a landing it was the hippo gryph carrying a heavy load of three passengers irene glanced at themand was surprised xanthippe she exclaimed the witch dismounted and grimaced my son promised to get married tomorrow if i helped today she said besides dragon on a pedestal i dont want my exhibits getting holed so when i heard the cyclopes charging about and fathomed what was up zzapp xanthippe marched up to the wiggle and glared at it drop dead she said the wiggle dropped dead good enough find a place to the side irene told her we must englobe the swarm if we can find the personnel will do xavier said come on dear irene looked at the young woman with him she was comely and unfamiliar whos she my bridetobe tomorrow xavier said proudly aint she something special but zzapp irene was horrified to see a small hole appear in the womans body she had walked too close to the swarm and been in the path of the wiggle but the woman paid no attention wiggles cant hurt me she remarked and used two stones to crush the worm that had just holed her it was zora zombieso much restored by requited love that she looked virtually normal her hair was now thick and black her flesh was firm and healthy and quite pleasing in contour and her eyes were clear even her clothing was good she no longer wore decaying rags but she retained her undead immunity to minor injury it was as if she had regressed from monthsdead at the time irene had first met her to weeksdead when irenes group welcomed her to daysdead when she fell in love with xavier and now was only hours or minutes dead she had evidently been a lovely young woman when she died a live girl would be dead by now xavier observed satisfied aint zora great no woman alive is better than her he leaned toward irene confidentially she aint cold neither shes warm now yes irene agreed faintly one part of her mind rebelled at the grotesque nature of the zombie but that was being driven out by the beautiful nature of the restoration it was a miracle of a sorta good sort then she had to attend to her own segment for the wiggles werent abating their onrush dragon on a pedestal other creatures arrived some were huge and strange but xanthippe seemed to recognize them you giants get over there she cried chomp the wiggles in your mandibles and spit out the remains they arent edible you mamoths fly up and catch the ones just overhead you gigantics scoot down under the leaves and catch any that are down there out of our sight watch out for your own hides those wiggles may be small but theyre deadly the strange large creatures spread out and worked on the wiggles xap the hippogryph was also very effective crunching them with his hard beak he took up the section near chem who seemed pleased enough to have him there there was a screeching behind again irene glanced back since she used her ears more than her eyes to locate the wig glesand saw three furies this could be real trouble zzapp a curse on you tisi cried the wiggle spun out of control and bounced off a tree its power gone another wiggle came through woe betide you meg cried at it what did you ever do for your mother who zapped away her last energy in order that you might someday swarm she raised her scourge and whipped the wiggle out of its hold irene relaxed the furies too had come to help it seemed that all the normal creatures of xanth were making common cause against this mutual threat as she worked irene continued to look around spotting new arrivals she saw the chocolate moose stomping wiggles with his sharp hoovesand next to him a flock of ducks nibbled on other wiggles beyond them were several impossibly odd creatures with huge hairy hands they seemed somehow eerily familiar suddenly she made the connection the mon ster under the bed she cried you do existnumbers of you and one of them waved that was probably the one that had been stationed under her bed before she had grown too old to believe in it another odd thing rolled into view stomping wiggles irene realized belatedly that it was a football everything was com ing to help but now the sun was very low night was stalking the land dragon on a pedestal some creatures like the monsters under the bed could function well in darkness but others could not if even a tenth of the wiggles got through it would be eventual doomand many more wiggles than that would escape in the night then a truly monstrous shape came over the trees darkening the sky farther it was a bird a roc no a greetings warriors it was the simurgh grundy had gotten through and the eternal bird had left its perch on the tree of seeds and come to help parnassus comes oh thank you thank you simurgh irene cried but it is almost dark and many creatures will get holed seeds of light and from the talons of the huge creature came a shower of tiny motes each glowing like a little star perform good woman the bird directed grow irene cried at them all the stars grew expanding into fat bulbs that radiated light everywhere some bulbs landed on the ground illuminating it others hung up in trees casting wider flares there were so many that the entire region became as bright as day the problem of night was solved careful simurgh chem called some wiggles travel high they will travel into mundane space the simurgh ex plained no harm will come of these as for the ones be tween a host of small birds appeared evidently brought by the large one each had an outsize beak those are pinches chem said her centaur education operating again just what we need the pinches swooped about just over the heads of the crea tures on the ground and the mamoths just above and caught any wiggles zapping by in that region they didnt bother with the really high wiggles and now irene understood why only the low ones posed either a shortterm or a longterm threat in the renewed light irene could see other arrivals there was a big friendly yak talking wiggles to death a bugbear was scaring them to death and dragon on a pedestal hiatus she exclaimed what are you doing on that car pet the zombie masters son floated close i went out to help look for ivy he explained i didnt find her but i did find the good magicians carpet so i flew it homeand got the news about the swarm so thats fine irene agreed she was glad hiatus had found a way to be useful zzapp a wiggle hovered close hiatus focused on itand a big ungainly ear grew from it overbalanced the wiggle fell to the ground unable to maintain its course still there were not enough creatures to complete the en circlement of the swarm on the ground her husband the king would not arrive with his forces for several hours irene was sure and that would be too late they had to contain the swarm while it was small enough to be containable every creature here was working loyally and hard at considerable personal risk but many more were needed something huge slithered along the ground it was the py thon of parnassus come at the simurghs command and be hind him came a bedlam of screaming wildhaired naked women the maenads the big bird really did rule parnassus the wild women spread out enormously increasing the fighting forces they seemed delighted with this task smashing with glee at every wiggle that appeared now the wild animals of this region were joining in too every creature was quick to appreciate the need for action still this was only one side of the swarm on the far side the wiggles could be spreading without hindrance but she had plenty to occupy her attention on this side the skirmish line was advancing now and the wiggles were thick the sound of the zzapps was constant creatures were getting holed and losses were mounting chems flank was blood flecked where a wiggle had grazed it and there was a maenad on the ground holed through the head in death the wild woman was rather pretty and irene felt a pang of regret for her this was no childs play childs playthat reminded her all too forcefully of ivy there near the terrible center of the swarm hiding precariously dragon on a pedestal behind an invisible forgetwhorl how long could ivy survive that even if the swarm were eventually contained what have we here irene turned againand there was the zombie master animating the dead maenad now the losses of personnel while painful would not be critical their zombies would carry on steadily the line moved forward the ranks closing tighter as they were augmented by other creatures the wiggle swarm was now a magnet for the people and animals of xanth all coming to risk their hides and lives in this valiant effort irene realized that the simurgh was broadcasting her powerful thoughts summoning anything within range the simurgh well understood the menace of the wiggles irene heard something new it sounded like the beat of many hooves she lookedand there at the fringe of visibility were many centaurs each carrying two men dor had found a way to travel quickly and now maybe they could complete the encirclement both men and centaurs would be effective against the wiggles and if there were enough of them there were it seemed at last enough gradually the circle closed the wiggles came even more quickly but that was because this was closer to the nest the creatures of xanth were winning they forged inward slowly abetted by the continuing light bulbs that showed every wiggle clearly not every ordinary bulb burned well and long but the simurgh had brought top quality seeds for this occasion the curve of the battle line became clear showing more of the circle of closure they had to maneuver to get past a lake whose surface was clogged with ash something had burned on the water recently taking some of the wiggles with it near that lake a relevant was using its trunk to smash wiggles and an allegory was crunching them in its teeth and so was a hypotenuse while a parody mimicked them irene was glad to see these creatures being of some help she had never had much use for them before now they were at the fringe of a rough plain beyond a low hill that was riddled by wiggle holes what a mess the worms made of this land irene thought of the whole of the land of dragon on a pedestal xanth resembling this region if the wiggles prevailed and shuddered the swarm had to be contained the circle of closure became small enough so that irene could see across to where the goblins and harpies held their front they had after all responded to the whistle the goblins were on the ground lined up in military order bashing effi ciently the harpies hovered above holding stones in their claws to squish the elevated wiggles the two groups held a major segment of the line and were perhaps for the first time in over eight hundred years cooperating with each other in useful work in retrospect it seemed that her encounter with the harpies had been fortunate harrowing as it had been at the time and there beyond a crevice was the nest itself irene paused to gaze at the dread artifact here was the source of all this mischief near it this side of a crevice was a small and odd group a boy a little girl and a small sixlegged dragon the chil drenat last they seemed to have no protection from the wiggles but they were safe behind their invisible shield with tiny flying fruits buzzing around the wiggles were so thick between the children and the adults that irene knew no one could reach the trio ahead before the entire wiggle menace was eliminated there might be a channel a place free of wiggles where the forgetwhorl had blanked them outbut irene couldnt see where that was and suspected that there was just enough variance in the paths of the wiggles to fill in that channel some wiggles might curve a little in flight not being able to hew to a geometrically straight line at any rate it wasnt worth the risk as the forgetwhorl could drift the moment the children stopped guiding it letting the wiggles suddenly through the children were in sight but hardly out of danger this seemed to be the limit of the contraction of the circle of closure any closer and it would be suicidal because there would not be enough space between individual wiggles to allow a creature to stand so they were at an impasse they had contained the menace but could not abolish itand they were getting very tired dragon on a pedestal they had to make a breakthrough soon or their line would begin to collapse and the wiggles would break out and win all their available forces had been brought into playand it wasnt enough chapter hero dragon suddenly there was light as thousands of light bulbs rained from the darkening sky and illuminated the entire region ivy blinked letting her eyes adjust to the new brilliance and looked about the wiggles showed clearly each casting several little shad ows they were so thick here that it would be risky to poke even a hand out from behind the whorl but now there was no risk of that for hugos flying cherries were also quite plain defining the whorl the three of them were safe the onset of night no longer meant doom beyond the immediate scene the plane of the traveling wiggles extended out across the devastated landscape ivy thought she saw some winged shapes at the horizon but couldnt be sure they were too distant and too fleeting she wondered who had sent the light bulbs they certainly were useful but the children still could not reach the nest it loomed there in the stark light monstrous and deadly like a giant pineapple in a process of a slow explosion so near and yet so far just across the crack how could they cross ivy squared her little shoulders and did what had to be done hugo think of a way to get across youll be a terror when you grow up hugo muttered what dragon on a pedestal nothing im trying to think he furrowed his brow and thought we must fill in the crack he concluded his intel ligence operating once again we must make a ramp so we can walk across good idea ivy agreed what do we fill it with i havent yet worked out that detail hugo confessed well work it out before the bulbs get tired of glowing she knew that light bulbs were notoriously unreliable generally blinking out just when most needed hugo concentrated again he knew they couldnt leave the shelter of the whorl to fetch rocks and if they scraped the ground they stood on into the crack their position would soon be too low for them to cross they needed something else something available and plentiful what could that be fruit he cried with inspiration as an especially bright bulb burst above his head fruit ivy agreed clapping her hands and dodging the falling fragments of the bulb probably a wiggle had holed it if they holed too many bulbs darkness would return that was another reason to act quickly hugo conjured a peach and tossed it through the whorl and into the crack they heard a thunk as it struck bottom we need more than that ivy pointed out she was a practical girl taking after her mother in that respect and per haps in other respects too hugo conjured several more peaches and threw them in there were several more thunks from the unseen depth something bigger ivy suggested the biggest you have that would be greatfruit hugo said after a moments consideration he conjured oneand the thing was so large it almost crushed him beneath its weight he eased it to the ground then shoved it forward the thing rolled grandly into the crack and disappeared splat that was a small one hugo said conjure some big ones ivy said but i couldnt handle them well think of a way ivy had little patience with excuses she resembled her mother in that respect too maybe if we make a channel dragon on a pedestal zzapp a wiggle holed the fringe of ivys dress that was too close for comfort watch the whorl she cried alarmed and not a little annoyed about the damage to her dress hastily hugo conjured another bunch of winged cherries and watched them fly forward sure enough the whorl had drifted to the right the party shifted to get squarely behind it again then they got to work on the channel stanley perceiving the need used his six sets of claws to help and very quickly hollowed out a fine crevice hugo used more cherries to verify the position of the whorl making sure it was remaining in place and then conjured the biggest greatfruit his enhanced talent could command the thing was as tall as he wasa huge yellow sphere with a dimpled rind it landed in the channel and rolled slowly into the crack splat after that it was routine one cherrybunch one greatfruit alternating steadily gradually filling the crack after a while the fruits stopped splatting and just bounced and finally one rolled to the brink and balked the crack was full they moved over carefully and deposited a few greatfruits to either side to broaden the ramp they filled in with smaller fruits to even it out now at last they had their way to cross to the nest ivy looked aroundand saw in the distance a ring of peo ple others had come to fight the wiggles mare imbri had gotten through but the wiggles were zapping so thickly that the people could not reach the nest so it was still up to the three of them lets move across ivy said keep a close watch on the whorl hugo stanley blow it over the ramp the little dragon had been resting now he revved up his wings and fanned up a small gale the whorl rolled to the ramp hugo sent a steady stream of flying fruit aloft cherries flapped so thickly that they darkened the local region a steady mass of them went haywire in the whorl and plunged into the crack helping to shore up the ramp dragon on a pedestal the whorl moved slowly and ponderously and invisibly to the center of the crack they were doing it then an errant gust of breeze passed by it came from a small gray cloud that had drifted up to observe the strange activity oops ivy said dismayed thats fracto indeed it was king cumulofractonimbus recognizing them at this instant and not giving so much as a wisp of fog for the threat to xanth since the wiggles didnt hurt clouds now intended to blow up some trouble he huffed and he puffed at right angles to the direction of progress oh no hugo cried another vector the whorl nudged to the right it started to move off the ramp in a moment it would plunge into the depths of the crack and be lostand so would they already the wriggles were zapping by close on the left forcing hugo and ivy to squeeze to the right fracto grinned and heaved out another draft of chilling air blow it back stanley blow it back ivy screamed but stanley could not counter the vector of the wind without leaving the ramp himselfand the shelter of the whorl his right three legs scrambled on the greatfruit rim of the ramp then fracto gave a nasty extra push augmented by a das tardly roll of thunder and the whorl moved to the edge and started to roll down off the ramp ivy screamed as the wiggles zapped thickly by the left side forcing her and hugo to the brink stanley took the plunge he scrambled off the ramp slip sliding down its sloping side he got to the right of the whorl braced himself and flapped his wings vigorously the whorl slowed in its descent paused and nudged back onto the ramp providing better cover for hugo and ivy but the little dragon off to the right side was now completely exposed fracto fired out a lightning jag of wrath he took another breath ready to blow out an adverse gale ivy saw that and pointed her finger in a perfect righteous fury hugode stroy she cried hugo knew better than to argue with that tone he conjured dragon on a pedestal a pineapple and hurled it with all his force into the hovering cloud the fruit exploded with a dull boom and fracto frag mented straggles of gray fog scudded away the king of clouds would need time to recuperate but the damage had been done stanley was in deep trouble zzapp zzapp holes appeared in the dragons wings he winced but kept flapping now that there was no further adverse wind stanleys breeze prevailed slowly the whorl defined by hugos renewed stream of cherries moved across and onto the far side of the crack zzapp a wiggle holed stanleys tail for the dragon re mained exposed he yiped but kept flapping stanley ivy screamed get back on the ramp behind the whorl the dragon scrambled up but as he did so his wings paused since he could not concentrate on two complex coor dinations at once the whorl slid back and teetered on the edge of the crack stanley saw the cherries falling and knew what that meant he stopped braced himself and flapped again vigorously the whorl resumed its forward motion despite the opposing slope zzapp stanleys neck was holed dark blood welled out and streamed down his scales his head dropped and his wing beat faltered the whorl began to backslide again keep going stanley ivy screamed desperately i know you can do it but water was welling in her eyes in much the way the blood was welling in the dragons neck with a great effort she compelled her own belief youre too tough to be stopped by worms perhaps in her maturity ivys magic would have been enough but she was only a child stanley tried to lift his head but could not still he flapped his wings as hard as he could the breeze was off since he could no longer see the guiding cherries and the whorl began to go astray blow left blow left ivy cried and the dragon aimed farther left and pumped desperately though there were more holes in his wings and his eyes were glazing the whorl drifted back on course dragon on a pedestal it wasnt sufficient stanley was halfway down in the crack straddling the mound of fruits while the whorl was beyond it his draft was losing effect climb out quickly ivy cried you can do it stanley you can do it but she could hardly see him through her tears hugo kept the cherries flying knowing there was nothing he could do stanley made his six legs move his head dragged on the ramp getting smeared with greatfruit refuse but his long low body moved he scrambled awkwardly up the slope and out leaving a trail of blood the whorl drifted back impelled by the slight slope beyond the crack the vectors never gave up the dragon made it to the edge just as the whorl did flap stanley flap ivy screamed horrified cherries were falling all around the dragon bouncing off his green hide stanley flapped but he was now in the middle of the whorl and wounded he had little strength remaining the breeze he blew was not enough to do more than hold the whorl in place hugos smart mind was still working and now he perceived a new strategy hold your wings out he called walk for ward the dragon heard him feebly stanley whomped forward wings out pelted by falling cherries the whorl moved with him the forget ivy exclaimed remembering itll make him forget hes in it hugo looked at her horrified even if he survives the holing his memory will be gone the nest loomed close stanley saw it and gathered his last remaining strength for a final effort all six legs heaved to gether and he leaped and sailed into the airand landed on top of the nest the whorl was dragged along with him settling around and into the nest the zapping of the wiggles faded at the center they still moved outward outside the nest but no new ones emerged the whorl had made them forget and so they had become dragon on a pedestal harmless the nest had been nullified thanks to stanleys he roic concluding jump the three of them were safe from the wigglesand so was xanth once the ring of people got rid of the remaining wiggles that was no easy task but it was at least possible to do stanley lay astride the huge nest as if he were mounted on a pedestal his blood dripping down around it to the ground oh stanley ivy cried rushing up to him hugo grabbed her arm whirling her around and holding her back no he cried dont go into the forgetwhorl ohthe forget she nodded i dont want to be for getted poor stanley one of the dragons ears twitched stanley had always had excellent hearing especially when he was mentioned that was the nature of his ears one eye opened ivy clapped her hands ooo he lives he remembers that doesnt necessarily follow hugo said cautiously his intelligence interfering with his emotion yes it does she insisted it has to make it reasonable hugo hugo put his mind to work again he could do some pretty impossible things when ivy told him to well since he is the gap dragon and he has lived for centuries in the middle of the forgetspell thats on the gap we conjectured that he could be partially immune but he could be completely immune in which case oh yes that must be it he cant be forgetted she stood and looked at the dragon but hes hurt awful bad hugo hes bleeding and everything weve got to help him hugo knew there was nothing they could do at the moment he looked aboutand spied the gap dragon the what hugo blinked then he saw beside the fullsized dragon the gorgon mother he cried waving violently from the distance the gorgon made a familiar signal cover your eyes hugo told ivy you too stanley do not look mother is on the way she will make everything right obediently ivy faced away and closed her eyes and stanley dragon on a pedestal relaxed into unconsciousness he was a tough little dragon but he was badly hurt they waited for some time then they heard something like pebbles dropping to the ground mothers glaring at wiggles hugo said figuring it out theyre turning to stone there was also a whompwhomp approaching how can the gap dragon be bigand small hugo asked then an swered his own question there must be another of the same species a lady dragon ivy said with female intuition the droppingpebbles sound stopped you may look now the gorgon said i am veiled ivy opened her eyes and looked the gorgon and the dra goness were crossing the greatfruit ramp the gorgon paused to turn and wave to the outer circle have cleared a channel she called another figure detached itself from the circle it was a centaur bearing a rider ivy knew who that would be the gorgon completed the distance and picked hugo up you get lost like this again she said severely and ill show you my face then she kissed him through the veil my arent you handsome whatever happened to you aw mom it was fun hugo protested but weve got to help stanley who stanley steamer ivy explained indicating the little dragon he saved xanthbut hes hurt oh yes of course but the gorgon stood aside while the big dragon whomped up sniffed stanley then opened her huge jaws and took him in her mouth she lifted him down off the nest and set him on the ground but the forget ivy protested shes immune too the gorgon reassured her a monstrous shape glided down from above the biggest bird ivy had ever imagined it banked and flew away a single feather drifted down thank you simurgh the gorgon called she picked up the feather paused and looked at ivy through her veil i think it is better if you do this ivy she said hes your friend dragon on a pedestal and it will work most effectively for you she handed her the feather ivy looked at the feather it had seemed small in the sky but it was as long as she was now that she held it but not heavy do what touch stanley oh ivy took the feather and touched the tip to the little dragons nose like this she asked perplexed wherever he hurts dear oh ivy stroked the feather across the wound in stanleys neckand it healed immediately oh she exclaimed thrilled she proceeded to touch the feather to every place stanley had been holed and soon the little dragon had mended completely once more he was able to hold his head up oh she cried a third time and hugged him joyously hugo how were you able to conjure good fruit the gor gon asked her son though her manner indicated she had an idea of the answer this was the way of mothers its ivys fault hugo replied when im near her i car do almost anything i can even think straight shes a sor ceress the gorgon studied ivy through her veil yes i believe she is just the way my father is a magician hugo continued happily then he sobered except he will be a magician again the gorgon said it will take some time of course for him to grow another figure approached seemingly careless of the re maining wiggles it was a fairly pretty young woman ivy didnt recognize may i help the woman inquired thank you no the gorgon said glancing at her in per plexity we seem to be in order here who is she ivy asked why dont the zap holes hurt her for the woman had several perforations i am zora zombie the woman said holes dont hurt zombies so i walked across in case there was anything i could do she spoke with a slight slurring as if her lips werent quite tight you dont look like a zombie hugo remarked dragon on a pedestal true love has almost restored me to life zora said and perhaps my spine was stiffened when i looked at your mothers face thats why i didnt recognize you the gorgon ex claimed you have changed so much i am what every zombie could be if conditions were right zora said now i can even do my magic again whats that ivy asked zora smiled depreciatingly its not very useful im afraid i can make creatures age faster age faster when i turn on my talent any animal will mature two years in only one year zora explained but since noone in his right mind cares to speed up his lifecertainly the man i loved when i was alive didnt she frowned then set that aside as dead history so i never had use for it but the gorgon perked up could you make a baby grow twice as fast as normal without harming him oh certainly zora agreed my talent never hurt anyone except that most people feel that aging is the same as hurting if you did it near ivy you could age a baby ten times as fast hugo said confidently ten times as fast the gorgon exclaimed zora you must come to babysit my husband certainly if you wish zora said i always like to help people especially older folk like my parents but isnt your husband already over a century old he is and he isnt the gorgon said believe me you will be welcome at our castle you and ivy together the centaur arrived ivy heard the beat of hooves and looked up her arms still around stanleys healed neck it was chem and on her was mother ivy cried with tears of joy and relief now she knew everything would be all right you must meet my friend stanley he saved xanth yes he did irene agreed dismounting and in the pro cess he helped show us how to move the forgetwhoris out of our way so no one else will be forgetted we shall make a statue of him dragon on a pedestal no ivy cried gazing wildly at the gorgon irene laughed patting stanley on the head not that way she reassured her daughter we shall carve it from genuine stone and set it beside the statue of night mare imbri exactly as i envisioned it will be on a pedestal with the words hero dragon in the base he will be famous she glanced across at the fullsized dragon his place in the gap will have to be filled by a substitute for a while until stanley is able to resume his duties there oh goody ivy said clapping her hands hell stay with me stanley is my friend that too irene agreed getting down to hug child and dragon together authors note the author wishes to thank a number of xanth fans for their contributions of punnish notions for this novel roughly in chronological order paul priu of the isle of illusionthe foot ball and the baseball diamond richard hoffmanthe torment pine bobby jt boglethe trance plant manuel enriquezbed bugs matt masonthe ladyfingers plant scan logan correctly pointed out that the time of no magic in the source of magic should have abolished the forgetspell on the gap chasm alee pontenbergthe bumble bee and the armordillo judylynn del reythe fountain of youth which just happens to occupy the same spot in mundania as it does in xanth and the gorgonzola cheese freeda scanlan the game of peopleshoes liz slaughterthe chocolate moose chris gardenthe mouth organ ben l geer who didnt exactly send a pun but pleaded for more xanth because it is his only link to reality bern pern eagan evidently a refugee from another serieswe do get all kinds here who introduced me to his friend the centaur of attention though that creature fled before i could capture him for this novel being shy and john caporale who sent me this plot summary dor and his friends use the centaur aisle of magic to cross over to the authors cluster science fiction frame work and explore for an ancient site sigh i regret to report that the gulf between different publishers can be greater than that between genres our heroes would never make it across unscathed but this does show how much more imagination my fans have than i do dragon on a pedestal and now it is done and i think this is punnishment enough please fans dont deluge me with another squintillion puns my mind may go up in smoke and wont dare sneak any more of these volumes out of xanth getting through parnassus is difficult enough as it is also please dont feel obliged to write me letters just because you feel i am neglected benign neglect is vital to a writer one month answered over sixty letters and got behind on my novel typing my publishers frown on that sort of thing and such frowns can be as petrifying as the gorgons stare just read and enjoy and keep your groans about the worst puns to yourself so people wont stare at you there will probably be another xanth novel along in a year or so i not much worse than this one in fact if you read this one carefully youll have a better notion than i do what that one is about but ill give you title and description anyway crewel lye a caustic yam about an unkind untruth till then piers anthony
