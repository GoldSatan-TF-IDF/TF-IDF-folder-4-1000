the quinns christmas by nora roberts hed never had christmas before not a real one with a tree and lights with presents not with family hed never had one in a house filled with music and the smell of fresh cookies and decorations hanging everywhere of course he wasnt a kid or anything sheesh he was in sixth grade it wasnt like he believed some fat guy in a red suit was going to pop down the chimney get real he was just getting into the whole business because everybody else was making such a production of it all that whispering and talking in code and giggling well the guys didnt giggle seth corrected but the women had let out a few and little aubrey was practically insane waiting for tomorrow morning but she was just a baby christmas was supposed to be special for kids for himself it was cool to be out of school and to figure a few presents were going to be tossed his way he wasnt a maniac about it he was only sneaking downstairs to scarf up some cookies how was a guy supposed to sleep when there were a million cookies in the house carrying the sketch hed framed in one hand seth tiptoed in the dark a boy of slight build with straw colored hair and cautious blue eyes to the dog following him he issued a stern warning to keep it down or theyd get busted there was music playing he stopped at the top of the stairs listening carefully to be sure it was the radio and not phillip at the piano after dinner his brothers he really like that phrase his brother after dinner theyd all played music until aubrey had finally passed out on graces lap then theyd kicked seth upstairs to bed and that was a gyp because it had barely been and it wasnt a school night or anything cam had made all those lame santa remarks razzing him remembering it seth tried to sneer but it came out as a wide delighted grin as he crept downstairs seth saw theyd left the tree on hed never seen anything like it anna had wanted a real one and in seths opinion anna ruled so theyd hauled in this big pine and the guys had grumbled about stringing lights but seth knew theyd liked it now it was loaded with what seemed like a thousand ornaments and presents with big bows and miles of ribbon were stacked under it some of them had his name on them probably dopey stuff like underwear and socks he told himself struggling against the sheer thrill of seeing those brightly wrapped boxes sparkle under the lights like they belonged there like he belonged there he started to walk over just to shake one but spotted anna sleeping on the couch seth cursed under his breath whipped what he had in his hands behind his back he flushed at the idea of getting caught doing a baby thing like poking at boxes that would be unwrapped in a matter of hours anyway he stood indecisive but the excuse of wanting cookies had become reality he grabbed the dogs collar before foolish could live up to his name and dash over to stick his wet nose in annas face seth hissed at the dog to sit then because anna had kicked off the throw he crept over to pull the cover back over her shed been square with him seth thought no more than square shed been everything good everything decent hed stopped expecting she and grace and the quinns had given him hope when hed come to believe hope was just on more fist in the face and seth wished there was something he could do to pay her back he hoped she liked the scarf hed gotten her it was really red and anna liked wearing red things but he wished it was like diamonds or something yeah right he thought to himself he backed away from the couch then snuck like a thief into the kitchen with foolish trailing behind him he had a smug grin on his face and his hand in the cookie jar when the back door swung open yelping he whipped the frame behind his back cam cursed and blocked the door seth he said it loud enough to warn his brothers to hide the bike theyd spent the last two hours assembling what are you doing nothing looks like petty thievery to me cam heard his brothers swearing whispers the commotion of getting the bike back down from the porch then stepped inside i thought you were cut off from the cookie supply that was yesterday needing to brazen it out seth plucked one out bit it its after midnight so its today good point ethan strolled in his big dog behind him took one look at the situation and shrugged out of his jacket wheres the coffee brandy phillip corrected and closed the back door that wind bites why arent you in bed dreaming of sugar plums since anna was asleep seths answer was short and crude he started to slide away but cam was quicker and dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder whats behind your back nothing youve been at the presents seth snorted eyed the distance to the doorway no shaking boxes is for girls and babies because hed been caught doing it twice this week he shrugged i only did it before because aubrey gets a band out of it uhhuh so whats behind your back nothing seth started to make his move but ethan ambled to the stove cutting off that route then philip strolled over to get a brandy snifter out of a cupboard boxed in seth hunched his shoulders its nothing its no big deal give it over kid cam crooked a finger then grunted when seth shoved the wooden picture frame into cams belly as cams eyes narrowed promising retribution seth tossed up his chin ever been hung by your toes over a yule log we dont have a yule log i can get one look at that ethan murmured sliding a hand over seths hair as the boy bristled its a picture of the house looks good phillip angled it to get a better view of the clever pencil sketch of the twostory house on the bay really good its no big deal i decide whats a big deal around here cam kept a hand on seths shoulder as he studied the sketch yes it was clever the boy had talent but more it meant home to all of them and this qualifies this is a very big deal whos it for seth shrugged he felt warm in the belly not creepy he realized but good good and warm the three men werent blocking him in they were standing with him as theyd stood with him before just us i was going to maybe leave it under the tree or something you can hang it someplace if you feel like it annas going to cry when she sees it seth looked up now nothing cam could have said would have pleased him more yeah oh yeah then shell give you all kinds of sloppy kisses and if you play your cards right enough cookies to keep you in a sugar coma till new years pretty good deal yeah cam rubbed a hand over seths shoulder then propped the sketch on the counter its a pretty good deal all together its snowing ethan said in his quiet voice seth bolted for the door phillip managed to snag him by the collar before the boy yanked open the door dashed out and tripped over his own christmas present no playing outside at he looked at his watch groaned man three in the morning i just want to see its white stuff phillip explained it falls out of the sky and makes the roads hazardous and ruins suede shoes its christmas snow seth said frantically and then immediately felt stupid well check it out from the front porch better cam dug into the cookie jar himself lets wake everybody up and get this party started seths eyes widened and even his own yelp of delight didnt embarrass him really now right now sure santas come by now hed want to avoid the snow cam sent a sneer towards phillip i hear he wears suede boots annas on the couch ill wake her up seth started out skidded to a halt and looked back his face was bright as a young boys should be on christmas morning this is really cool as he raced toward the living room seth laughed about cams santa in suede boots he had something a lot better than santa claus and a bunch of elves he had family
