shadow games by glen cook the fourth chronicle of the black company chapter one the crossroads we seven remained at the crossroads watching the dust from the eastern way even irrepressible oneeye and goblin were stricken by the finality of the hour ottos horse whickered he closed her nostrils with one hand patted her neck with the other quieting her it was a time for contemplation the final emotional milemark of an era then there was no more dust they were gone birds began to sing so still did we remain i took an old notebook from my saddlebag settled in the road in a shaky hand i wrote the end has come the parting is done silent darling and the torque brothers have taken the road to lords the black company is no more yet i will continue to keep the annals if only because a habit of twentyfive years is so hard to break and who knows those to whom i am obliged to carry them may find the account interesting the heart is stilled but the corpse stumbles on the company is dead in fact but not in name and we o merciless gods stand witness to the power of names i replaced the book in my saddlebag well thats that i swatted the dust off the back of my lap peered down our own road into tomorrow a low line of greening hills formed a fencerow over which sheeplike tufts began to bound the quest begins we have time to cover the first dozen miles that would leave only seven or eight thousand more i surveyed my companions oneeye was the oldest by a century a wizard wrinkled and black as a dusty prune he wore an eyepatch and a floppy battered black felt hat that hat seemed to suffer every conceivable misfortune yet survived every indignity likewise otto a very ordinary man he had been wounded a hundred times and had survived he almost believed himself favored of the gods ottos sidekick was hagop another man with no special color but another survivor my glance surprised a tear then there was goblin what is there to say of goblin the name says it all and yet nothing he was another wizard small feisty forever at odds with oneeye without whose enmity he would curl up and die he was the inventor of the frogfaced grin we five have been together twentysome years we have grown old together perhaps we know one another too well we form limbs of a dying organism last of a mighty magnificent storied line i fear we who look more like bandits than the best soldiers in the world denigrate the memory of the black company two more murgen whom oneeye sometimes calls pup was twentyeight the youngest he joined the company after our defection from the empire he was a quiet man of many sorrows unspoken with no one and nothing but the company to call his own yet an outsider and lonely man even here as are we all as are we all lastly there was lady who used to be the lady lost lady beautiful lady my fantasy my terror more silent than murgen but from a different cause despair once she had it all she gave it up now she has nothing nothing she knows to be of value that dust on the lords road was gone scattered by a chilly breeze some of my beloved had departed my life forever no sense staying around cinch them up i said and set an example i tested the ties on the pack animals mount up oneeye you take the point finally a hint of spirit as goblin carped i have to eat his dust if oneeye had point that meant goblin had rearguard as wizards they were no mountain movers but they were useful one fore and one aft left me feeling far more comfortable about his turn dont you think things like that dont deserve a turn goblin said he tried to giggle but only managed a smile that was a ghost of his usual toadlike grin oneeyes answering glower was not much pumpkin either he rode out without comment murgen followed fifty yards behind a twelvefoot lance rigidly upright once that lance had flaunted our standard now it trailed four feet of tattered black cloth the symbolism lay on several levels we knew who we were it was best that others did not the company had too many enemies hagop and otto followed murgen leading pack animals then came lady and i also with tethers behind goblin trailed us by seventy yards and thus we always traveled for we were at war with the world or maybe it was the other way around i might have wished for outriders and scouts but there was a limit to what seven could accomplish two wizards were the next best thing we bristled with weaponry i hoped we looked as easy as a hedgehog does to a fox the eastbound road dropped out of sight i was the only one to look back in hopes silent had found a vacancy in his heart but that was a vain fantasy and i knew it in emotional terms we had parted ways with silent and darling months ago on the bloodsodden hatedrenched battleground of the barrowland a world was saved there and so much else lost we will live out our lives wondering about the cost different hearts different roads looks like rain croaker lady said her remark startled me not that what she said was not true it did look like rain but it was the first observation she had volunteered since that dire day in the north maybe she was going to come around chapter two the road south the farther we come the more it looks like spring oneeye observed he was in a good mood i caught the occasional glint of mischief brewing in goblins eyes too lately before long those two would find some excuse to revive their ancient feud the magical sparks would fly if nothing else the rest of us would be entertained even ladys mood improved though she spoke little more than before breaks over i said otto kill the fire goblin youre point i stared down the road another two weeks and we would be near charm i had not yet revealed what we had to do there i noticed buzzards circling something dead ahead near the road i do not like omens they make me uncomfortable those birds made me uncomfortable i gestured goblin nodded ill go now he said stretch it out a bit right murgen gave him an extra fifty yards otto and hagop gave murgen additional room but oneeye kept pressing up behind lady and i rising in his stirrups trying to keep an eye on goblin got a bad feeling about that croaker he said a bad feeling though goblin raised no alarm oneeye was right those doombirds did mark a bad thing a fancy coach lay overturned beside the road two of its team of four had been killed in the traces probably because of injuries two animals were missing around the coach lay the bodies of six uniformed guards and the driver and that of one riding horse within the coach were a man a woman and two small children all murdered hagop i said see what you can read from the signs lady do you know these people do you recognize their crest i indicated fancywork on the coach door the falcon of rail proconsul of the empire but he isnt one of those hes older and fat they might be family hagop told us they were headed north the brigands overtook them he held up a scrap of dirty cloth they didnt get off easy themselves when i did not respond he drew my attention to the scrap grey boys i mused grey boys were imperial troops of the northern armies bit out of their territory deserters lady said the dissolution has begun likely i frowned i had hoped decay would hold off till we got a running start lady mused three months ago travelling the empire was safe for a virgin alone she exaggerated but not much before the struggle in the barrowland consumed them great powers called the taken watched over the provinces and requited unlicensed wickedness swiftly and ferociously still in any land or time there are those brave or fool enough to test the limits and others eager to follow their example that process was accelerating in an empire bereft of its cementing horrors i hoped their passing had not yet become a general suspicion my plans depended on the assumption of old guises shall we start digging otto asked in a minute i said how long ago did it happen hagop couple of hours and nobodys been along oh yeah but they just went around must be a nice bunch of bandits oneeye mused if they can get away with leaving bodies laying around maybe theyre supposed to be seen i said could be theyre trying to carve out their own barony likely lady said ride carefully croaker i raised an eyebrow i dont want to lose you oneeye cackled i reddened but it was good to see some life in her we buried the bodies but left the coach civilized obligation fulfilled we resumed our journey two hours later goblin came riding back murgen stationed himself where he could be seen on a curve we were in a forest now but the road was in good repair with the woods cleared back from its sides it was a road upgraded for military traffic goblin said theres an inn up ahead i dont like its feel night would be along soon we had spent the afternoon planting the dead it look alive the countryside had gotten strange after the burying we met no one on the road the farms near the woods were abandoned teeming twenty people in the inn five more in the stables thirty horses another twenty people out in the woods forty more horses penned there a lot of other livestock too the implications seemed obvious enough pass by or meet trouble headon the debate was brisk otto and hagop said straight in we had oneeye and goblin if it got hairy oneeye and goblin did not like being put on the spot i demanded an advisory vote murgen and lady abstained otto and hagop were for stopping oneeye and goblin eyeballed one another each waiting for the other to jump so he could come down on the opposite side we go straight at it then i said these clowns are going to split but still make a majority for whereupon the wizards ganged up and voted to jump in just to make a liar out of me three minutes later i caught my first glimpse of the ramshackle inn a hardcase stood in the doorway studying goblin another sat in a rickety chair tilted against the wall chewing a stick or piece of straw the man in the doorway withdrew grey boys hagop had called the bandits whose handiwork we encountered on the road but grey was the color of uniforms in the territories whence we came in forsberger the most common language in the northern forces i asked the man in the chair place open for business yeah chairsitters eyes narrowed he wondered oneeye otto hagop see to the animals softly i asked you catching anything goblin somebody just went out the back theyre on their feet inside but it dont look like trouble right away chairsitter did not like us whispering how long you reckon on staying he asked i noted a tatoo on one wrist another giveaway betraying him as an immigrant from the north just tonight were crowded but well fit you in somehow he was a cool one trapdoor spiders these deserters the inn was their base the place where they marked out their victims but they did their dirt on the road silence reigned inside the inn we examined the men there as we entered and a few women who looked badly used they did not ring true wayside inns usually are familyrun establishments infested with kids and old folks and all the oddities in between none of those were evident just hard men and bad women there was a large table available near the kitchen door i seated myself with my back to a wall lady plopped down beside me i sensed her anger she was not accustomed to being looked at the way these men were looking at her she remained beautiful despite road dirt and rags i rested a hand upon one of hers a gesture of restraint rather than of possession a plump girl of sixteen with haunted bovine eyes came to ask how many we were our needs in food and quarters whether bath water should be heated how long we meant to tarry what was the color of our coin she did it listlessly but right as though beyond hope filled only with dread of the cost of doing it wrong i intuited her as belonging to the family who rightfully operated the inn i tossed her a gold piece we had plenty having looted certain imperial treasures before departing the barrowland the flicker of the spinning coin sparked a sudden glitter in the eyes of men pretending not to be watching oneeye and the others clumped in dragged up chairs the little black man whispered theres a big stir out in the woods they have plans for us a froggish grin yanked at the left corner of his mouth i gathered he might have plans of his own he likes to let the bad guys ambush themselves theres plans and plans i said if they are bandits well let them hang themselves he wanted to know what i meant my schemes sometimes got more nasty than his that is because i lose my sense of humor and just go for maximum dirt we rose before dawn oneeye and goblin used a favorite spell to put everyone in the inn into a deep sleep then they slipped out to repeat their performance in the woods the rest of us readied our animals and gear i had a small skirmish with lady she wanted me to do something for the women kept captive by the brigands if i try to right every wrong i run into ill never get to khatovar she did not respond we rode out minutes later oneeye said we were near the end of the forest this looks as good a place as any i said murgen lady and i turned into the woods west of the road hagop otto and goblin turned east oneeye just turned around and waited he was doing nothing apparent goblin was busy too what if they dont come murgen asked then we guessed wrong theyre not bandits ill send them an apology on the wind nothing got said for a while when next i moved forward to check the road oneeye was no longer alone a halfdozen horsemen backed him my heart twisted his phantoms were all men i had known old comrades long dead i retreated more shaken than i had expected my emotional state did not improve sunlight dropped through the forest canopy to dapple the doubles of more dead friends they waited with shields and weapons ready silently as befit ghosts they were not ghosts really except in my mind they were illusions crafted by oneeye across the road goblin was raising his own shadow legion given time to work those two were quite the artists there was no doubt now even who lady was hoofbeats i said needlessly theyre coming my stomach turned over had i bet to an inside straight taken too long a shot if they chose to fight if goblin or oneeye faltered too late for debate croaker i looked at lady a glowing memory of what she had been she was smiling she knew my mind how many times had she been there herself albeit on a grander game board the brigands pounded down the aisle formed by the road and reined in in confusion when they saw oneeye awaiting them i started forward all through the woods ghost horses moved with me there was harness noise brush noise nice touch oneeye what you call verisimilitude there were twentyfive bandits they wore ghastly expressions their faces went paler still when they spied lady when they saw the specterbanner on murgens lance the black company was pretty well known two hundred ghost bows bent fifty hands tried to find some skybelly to grab i suggest you dismount and disarm i told their captain he gulped air a few times considered the odds did as directed now clear away from the horses you naughty boys they moved lady made a gesture the horses all turned and trotted toward goblin who was their real motivator he let the animals pass they would return to the inn to proclaim the terror ended slick oh slick not even a hangnail that was the way we did it in the old days maneuver and trickery why get yourself hurt if you can whip them with a shuffle and con we got the prisoners into a rope line where they could be adequately controlled then headed south the brigands were greatly exercised when goblin and oneeye relaxed they didnt think it was fair of us two days later we reached vest with oneeye and goblin again supporting her grand illusion lady remanded the deserters to the justice of the garrison commander we only had to kill two of them to get them there something of a distraction along the road now there was none and charm drew closer by the hour i had to face the fact that trouble beckoned the bulk of the annals which my companions believed to be in my possession remained in imperial hands they had been captured at queens bridge an old defeat that still stings i was promised their return shortly before the crisis in the barrowland but that crisis prevented their delivery afterward there was nothing to do but go fetch them myself chapter three a tavern in taglios willow scrunched a little more comfortably into his chair the girls giggled and dared one another to touch his cornsilk hair the one with the most promising eyes reached ran her fingers down its length willow looked across the room winked at cordy mather this was the life till their fathers and brothers got wise this was every mans dream with the same old lethal risks asneaking if it kept on and did not catch up hed soon weigh four hundred pounds and be the happiest slug in taglios who would have thought it a simple tavern in a straitlaced burg like this a hole in the wall like those that graced every other street corner back home here such a novelty they couldnt help getting rich if the priests didnt get over their inertia and shove a stick into the spokes of course it helped them being exotic outlanders that the whole city wanted to see even those priests and their little chickies especially their little brown daughters a long insane journey getting here but worth every dreadful step now he folded his hands upon his chest and let the girls take what liberties they wanted he could handle it he could put up with it he watched cordy tap another barrel of the bitter thirdrate green beer hed brewed these taglian fools paid three times what it was worth what kind of a place never ran into beer before hell the kind of place guys with no special talents and itchy feet dream of finding cordy brought a mug over he said swan this keeps on were going to have to hire somebody to help me brew were going to be tapped out in a couple days why worry how long can it last those priest characters are starting to smolder now theyre going to start looking for some excuse to shut us down worry about finding another racket as sweet not about making more beer faster what what do you mean what you got a grim look all of a sudden the blackbird of doom just walked in the front door willow twisted so he could see that end of the room sure enough blade had come home tall lean ebony head shaved to a polish muscles rippling with the slightest movement he looked like some kind of gleaming statue he looked around without approval then he strode to willows table took a seat the girls gave him the eye he was as exotic as willow swan come to collect your share and tell us how lousy we are corrupting these children willow asked blade shook his head that old spook smokes having dreams again the woman wants you shit swan dropped his feet to the floor here was the fly in the ointment the woman wouldnt leave them alone what is it this time whats he doing hemp hes a wizard he dont need to do nothing to get obnoxious shit swan said again what do you think we just do a fadeout here sell the rest of cordys rat piss and head back up the river a big slow grin spread across blades face too late boy you been chosen you cant run fast enough that smoke he might be a joke if he was to open shop up where you came from but around here hes the bad boss spook pusher you try to head out youre going to find your toes tied in knots that the official word they didnt say it that way thats what they meant so what did he dream this time why drag us in shadowmasters more shadowmasters been a big meet at shadowcatch he says theyre going to stop talking and start doing he says moonshadow got the call says well be seeing them in taglian territory real soon now big deal been trying to sell us that since the day we got here practically blades face lost all its humor it was different this time man theres scared and scared you know what i mean and smoke and the woman was the second kind this time and it aint just shadowmasters they got on the brain now said to tell you the black company is coming said youd know what that means swan grunted as if hit in the stomach he stood drained the beer cordy had brought looked around as if unable to believe what he saw damnedfoolest thing i ever heard blade the black company coming here said thats whats got the shadowmasters riled willow said theyre rattled good thiss the last free country north of them under the river and you know whats on the other side of shadowcatch i dont believe it you know how far theyd have to come about as far as you and cordy blade had joined willow and cordwood mather two thousand miles into their journey south yeah you tell me blade who in the hell besides you and me and cordy would be crazy enough to travel that far without any reason they got a reason according to smoke like what i dont know you go up there like the woman says maybe shell tell you ill go well all go just to stall and first chance we get were going to get the hell out of taglios if they got the shadowmasters stirred up down there and the black company coming in i dont want to be anywhere around blade leaned back so one of the girls could wiggle in closer his expression was questioning swan said i seen what those bastards could do back home i saw roses caught between them and hell just take my word for it blade big mojo and all bad if theyre coming for real and were still around when they show you might end up wishing wed let those crocs go ahead and snack on you blade never had been too clear on why he had been thrown to the crocodiles and willow was none too clear on why he had talked cordy into dragging him out and taking him along though blade had been a right enough guy since hed paid back the debt i think you ought to help them swan blade said i like this town i like the people only thing wrong with them is they dont have sense enough to burn all the temples down damnit blade i aint the guy can help you and cordy are the only ones around who know anything about soldiering i was in the army for two months i never even learned how to keep in step and cordy dont have the stomach for it anymore all he wants is to forget that part of his life cordy had overheard most of what had been said he came over im not that bad off willow i dont object to soldiering when the cause is right i just was with the wrong bunch up there im with blade i like taglios i like the people im willing to do what i can to see they dont get worked over by the shadowmasters you heard what he said the black company i heard i also heard him say they want to talk about it i think we ought to go find out whats going on before we run our mouths and say what were not going to do all right im going to change hold the fort and all that blade keep your mitts off the one in the red i got first dibs he stalked off cordy mather grinned youre catching on how to handle willow blade if thiss going down the way i think he dont need handling hell be the guy out front when they try to stop the shadowmasters you could roast him in coals and hed never admit it but hes got a thing for taglios cordy mather chuckled youre right hes finally found him a home and no one is going to move him out not the shadowmasters or the black company they as bad as he lets on worse lots worse you take all the legends you ever heard back home and everything you heard tell around here and anything you can imagine and double it and maybe youre getting close theyre mean and theyre tough and theyre good and maybe the worst thing about them is that theyre tricky like you cant imagine tricky theyve been around four five hundred years and no outfit lasts that long without being so damned nasty even the gods dont screw with them mothers hide your babies blade said smoke had him a dream cordys face darkened yeah ive heard tell wizards maybe make things come true by dreaming them first maybe we ought to cut smokes throat willow was back he said maybe we ought to find out whats going on before we do anything cordy chuckled blade grinned then they began shooing the marks out of the tavern each making sure an appointment was understood by one or more of the young ladies chapter four the dark tower i piddled around another five days before working myself up to a little afterbreakfast skull session i introduced the subject in a goldentongued blurt our next stopover will be the tower what are you crazy croaker knew we should have kept an eye on him after the sun went down knowing glances ladys way she stayed out of it i thought she was going with us not the other way around only murgen did not snap up a membership in the bitchoftheminute club good lad that murgen lady of course already knew a stopover was needed im serious guys i said if i wanted to be serious oneeye would be too why he asked i sort of shrank to pick up the annals i left behind at queens bridge we got caught good there only because we were the best and desperate and sneaky had we been able to crack the imperial encirclement at the cost of half the company there were more important concerns at the time than books i thought you already got them i asked for them and was told i could have them but we were busy at the time remember the dominator the limper toadkiller dog all that lot there wasnt any chance to actually lay hands on them lady supported me with a nod getting really into the spirit there goblin pasted on his most ferocious face made him look like a sabertoothed toad then you knew about this clean back before we ever left the barrowland i admitted that that was true you goatfulover i bet youve spent all this time concocting some halfassed offthewall plan thats guaranteed to get us all killed i confessed that that was mostly true too were going to ride up there like we own the tower youre going to make the garrison think lady is still number one oneeye snorted stomped off to the horses goblin got up and stared down at me and stared some more and sneered were just going to strut in and snatch them eh like the old man used to say audacity and more audacity he did not ask his real question lady answered it for him anyway i gave my word goblin did not mouth the next question either no one did and lady left it hanging it would be easy for her to job us she could keep her word and have us for breakfast afterward if she wanted my plan boiled down depended entirely on my trust in her it was a trust my comrades did not share but they do however foolishly trust me the tower at charm is the largest single construction in the world a featureless black cube five hundred feet to the dimension it was the first project undertaken by the lady and the taken after their return from the grave so many lifetimes ago from the tower the taken had marched forth and raised their armies and conquered half the world its shadow still fell upon half the earth for few knew that the heart and blood of the empire had been sacrificed to buy victory over a power older and darker still there is but one groundlevel entrance to the tower the road leading to it runs as straight as a geometricians dream it passes through parklike grounds that only someone who had been there could believe was the site of historys bloodiest battle i had been there i remembered goblin and oneeye and hagop and otto remembered too most of all oneeye remembered it was on this plain that he destroyed the monster that had murdered his brother i recalled the crash and tumult the screams and terrors the horrors wrought by wizards at war and not for the first time i wondered did they really all die here they went so easily who you talking about oneeye demanded he did not need to concentrate on keeping lady englamored the taken sometimes i think about how hard it was to get rid of the limper then i wonder how so many taken could have gone down so easy a whole bunch in a couple days almost never where i could see it so sometimes i get to suspecting there was maybe some faking and two or three are still around somewhere goblin squeaked but they had six different plots going croaker they was all backstabbing each other but i only saw a couple of them check out none of you guys saw the others go you heard about it maybe there was one more plot behind all the other plots maybe lady gave me an odd almost speculative look like maybe she had not thought much about it herself and did not like the ideas i stirred now they died dead enough for me croaker oneeye said i saw plenty of bodies look over there their graves are marked that dont mean theres anybody in them raven died on us twice turn around and there he was again on the hoof lady said you have my permission to dig them up if you like croaker a glance showed me she was chiding me gently maybe even teasing thats all right maybe someday when im good and bored and got nothing better to do than look at rotten corpses gah murgen said cant you guys talk about something else which was a mistake otto laughed hagop started humming to his tune otto sang the worms crawl in the worms crawl out the ants play the bagpipes on your snout goblin and oneeye joined in murgen threatened to ride over and puke on somebody we were distracting ourselves from the dark promise looming ahead oneeye stopped singing to say none of the taken were the sort who could lie low all these years croaker if any survived we would have seen the fireworks me and goblin would have heard something anyway i guess youre right but i did not feel reassured maybe some part of me just did not want the taken to be all dead we were approaching the incline that led up to the doorway into the tower for the first time the structure betrayed signs of life men clad as brightly as peacocks appeared on the high battlements a handful came out of the gateway hastily preparing a ceremonial in greeting to their mistress oneeye hooted derisively when he saw their apparel he would not have dared last time he was there i leaned over and whispered be careful she designed the uniforms on them guys i hoped they wanted to greet the lady hoped they had nothing more sinister in mind that depended on what news they had had from the north sometimes evil rumors travel swifter than the wind audacity guys i said always audacity be bold be arrogant keep them reeling i looked at that dark entrance and reflected aloud they know me here thats what scares me goblin squeaked then he cackled the tower filled more and more of the world murgen whod never seen it before surrendered to openmouthed awe otto and hagop pretended that that stone pile did not impress them goblin and oneeye became too busy to pay much attention lady could not be impressed she had built the place when she was someone both greater and smaller than the person she was now i became totally involved in creating the persona i wanted to project i recognized the colonel in charge of the welcoming party we had crossed paths when my fortunes had led me into the tower before our feelings toward one another were ambiguous at best he recognized me too and he was baffled the lady and i had left the tower together most of a year ago how you doing colonel i asked putting on a big friendly grin we finally made it back mission successful he glanced at lady i did the same from the edge of my eye now was her chance she had on her most arrogant face i could have sworn she was the devil who haunted this tower well she was once that person did not die when she lost her powers did she it looked like she would play my game i sighed closed my eyes momentarily while the tower guard welcomed their liege i trusted her but always there are reservations you cannot predict other people especially not the hopeless always there was the chance she might reassume the empire hiding in her secret part of the tower letting her minions believe she was unchanged there was nothing to stop her trying she could go that route even after keeping her promise to return the annals that my companions believed was what she would do and they dreaded her first order as empress of shadow restored chapter five chains of empire lady kept her promise i had the annals in hand within hours of entering the tower while its denizens were still overawed by her return but i want to go on with you croaker this while we watched the sun set from the towers battlements the second evening after our arrival i of course replied with the golden tongue of a horse seller uh uh but like that master of the glib and facile remark why the hell did she want to do that she had it all there in the tower a little careful faking and she could spend the rest of her natural life as the most powerful being in the world why go riding off with a band of tired old men who did not know where they were going or why only that they had to keep moving lest something their consciences maybe caught them up theres nothing here for me anymore she said as if that explained anything i want i just want to find out what its like to be ordinary people you wouldnt like it not near as much as you like being the lady but i never liked that very much not after i had it and found out what i really had you wont tell me i cant go will you was she kidding no i would not it had been the surface understanding anyway but it was an understanding i expected to perish once she reestablished herself in the tower i was disconcerted by the implications can i go if thats what you want theres a problem isnt there always if theres a woman involved i cant leave right now things have gotten confused here i need a few days to straighten them out so i can leave with a clear conscience we had not encountered any of the troubles i expected none of her people dared scrutinize her closely all the labors of oneeye and goblin were wasted effort with that audience the word was out the lady was at the helm again the black company was in the fold once more under her protection and that was enough for her people wonderful but opal was only a few weeks away from opal it was a short passage over the sea of torments to ports outside the empire i thought i wanted to get out while our luck was holding you understand dont you croaker itll only be a few days honest just long enough to shape things up the empire is a good machine that works smooth as long as the proconsuls are sure someone is in charge all right all right we can last a couple days as long as you keep people away and you keep out of the way yourself most of the time dont let them get too good a look at you i dont intend to croaker yeah go teach your grandmother to suck eggs startled i laughed she kept getting more human all the time and more able to laugh at herself she had good intentions but he or she who would rule an empire becomes slave to its administrative detail a few days came and went and a few more and a few more still i could entertain myself skulking around the towers libraries digging into rare texts from the domination or before unravelling the snarled threads of northern history but for the rest of the guys it was rough there was nothing for them to do but try to keep out of sight and worry and bait goblin and oneeye though they did not have much luck with that to those of us without talent the tower was just a big dark pile of rock but to those two it was a great throbbing engine of sorcery still peopled by numerous practitioners of the dark arts they lived every moment in dread oneeye handled it better than goblin he managed to escape occasionally going out to the old battlefield to prowl among his memories sometimes i joined him halfway tempted to take up ladys invitation to open a few old graves still not comfortable about what happened oneeye asked one afternoon as i stood leaning on a bowstave over a marker bearing the name and sigil of the taken who had been called the faceless man oneeyes tone was as serious as it ever gets not entirely i admitted i cant pin it down and it dont matter much now but when you reflect on what happened here it dont add up i mean it did at the time it all looked like it was inevitable a great killoff that rid the world of a skillion rebels and most of the taken leaving the lady a free hand and setting her up for the dominator at the same time but in the context of later events oneeye had started to stroll pulling me along in his wake he came to a place that was not marked at all except in his memory a thing called a forvalaka had perished there a thing that had slaughtered his brother maybe way back in the days when we first became involved with soulcatcher the ladys legate to beryl the forvalaka was a sort of vampirous wereleopard originally native to oneeyes own home jungle somewhere way down south it had taken oneeye a year to catch up with and have his revenge upon this one youre thinking about how hard it was to get rid of the limper he said his voice was thoughtful i knew he was recalling something i thought he had put out of mind we were never certain that the forvalaka which killed tomtom was the forvalaka that paid the price because in those days the taken soulcatcher worked closely with another taken called shapeshifter and there was evidence to suggest shifter might have been in beryl that night and using the forvalaka shape to assure the destruction of the ruling family so the empire could take over on the cheap if oneeye had not avenged tomtom on the right creature it was far too late for tears shifter was another of the victims of the battle at charm im thinking about limper i admitted i killed him at that inn oneeye i killed him good and if he hadnt turned up again id never have doubted that he was gone and no doubts about these some you want to sneak out after dark and dig one of them up whats the point therell be somebody in the grave and no way to prove it isnt who its supposed to be they were killed by other taken and by members of the circle thats a little different than getting worked on by a notalent like you he meant no talent for sorcery i know thats what keeps me from getting obsessed with the whole mess knowing that those who supposedly killed them really had the power to do them in oneeye stared at the ground where once a cross stood with the forvalaka nailed upon it after a while he shivered and came back to now well it doesnt matter now it was long ago if not very far away and far away is where well be if we ever get out of here he pulled his floppy black hat forward to keep the sun out of his eyes looked up at the tower we were being watched why does she want to go with us thats the one i keep coming back to whats in this for her oneeye looked at me with the oddest expression he pushed his hat back put his hands on his hips cocked his head a moment then shook it slowly croaker sometimes youre too much to be believed why are you hanging around here waiting for her instead of heading out putting miles behind it was a good question and one i shied off anytime i tried to examine it well i guess i kind of like her and think she deserves a shot at some kind of regular life shes all right really i caught a transient smirk as he turned to the unmarked grave life wouldnt be half fun without you in it croaker watching you bumble through is an education in itself how soon can we get moving i dont like this place i dont know a few more days therere things she has to wrap up first thats what you said i am afraid i got snappish ill let you know when when seemed never to come days passed lady remained ensnared in the web of the administrative spider then the messages began pouring in from the provinces in response to edicts from the tower each one demanded immediate attention we had been closed up in that dread place for two weeks get us the hell out of here croaker oneeye demanded my nerves cant take this place anymore look theres stuff shes got to do theres stuff weve got to do according to you who says what we got to do has to wait on what shes got to do and goblin jumped on me with both feet we put up with your infatuation for about twenty years croaker he exaggerated because it was amusing something to ride you about when times got boring but it aint nothing i mean to get killed over i absodamnlutely guarantee even if she makes us all field marshals i warded a flash of anger it was hard but goblin was right i had no business hanging around there keeping everyone at maximum risk the longer we waited the more certain it was that something would go sour we were having enough trouble getting along with the tower guards who resented our being so close to their mistress after haying fought against her for so many years we ride out in the morning i said my apologies i was elected to lead the company not just croaker forgive me for losing sight of that crafty old croaker oneeye and goblin looked properly abashed i grinned so go get packed were gone with the morning sun she wakened me in the night for a moment i thought i saw her face she had heard she begged me to stay just one more day or two at the most she did not want to be here any more than we did surrounded and taunted by all that she had lost she wanted to go away to go with us to remain with me the only friend shed ever had she broke my heart it sounds sappy when you write it down in words but a man has to do what a man has to do in a way i was proud of me i did not give an inch there is no end to it i told her therell always be just one more thing that has to be done khatovar gets no closer while i wait death does i value you too i dont want to leave death lurks in every shadow in this place it writhes in the heart of every man who resents my influence it was that kind of empire too and in the past few days a lot of old imperials were given cause to resent me deeply you promised me dinner at the gardens in opal i promised you a lot more than that my heart said aloud i replied so i did and the offer still stands but i have to get my men out of here i turned reflective while she turned uncharacteristically nervous i saw the fires of schemes flickering behind her eyes being rejected there were ways she could manipulate me we both knew that but she never used the personal to gain political ends not with me anyway i guess each of us at some time finds one person with whom we are compelled toward absolute honesty one person whose good opinion of us becomes a substitute for the broader opinion of the world and that opinion becomes more important than all our sneaky sleazy schemes of greed lust selfaggrandizement whatever we are up to while lying the world into believing we are just plain nice folks i was her truth object and she was mine there was only one thing we hid from one another and that was because we were afraid that if it came into the open it would reshape everything else and maybe shatter that broader honesty are lovers ever honest i figure itll take us three weeks to reach opal itll take another week to find a trustworthy shipmaster and to work oneeye up to crossing the sea of torments so twentyfive days from today ill go to the gardens ill have the camelia grotto reserved for the evening i patted the lump next to my heart that lump was a beautifully tooled leather wallet containing papers commissioning me a general in the imperial armed forces and naming me a diplomatic legate answerable only to the lady herself precious precious and one good reason some longtime imperials had a big hate on for me i am not sure just how that came about some banter during one of those rare hours when she was not issuing decrees or signing proclamations next thing i knew i had been brought to bay by a pack of tailors they fitted me out with a complete imperial wardrobe never will i unravel the significance of all the piping badges buttons medals doodads and gewgaws i felt silly wearing all that clutter i didnt need much time to see some possibilities though in what at first i interpreted as an elaborate practical joke she does have that kind of sense of humor not always taking this great dreadfully humorless empire of hers seriously i am sure she saw the possibilities long before i did anyway we were talking the gardens in opal and the camelia grotto there the acme of that citys society seeandbeseen ill take my evening meal there i told her youre welcome to join me hints of hidden things tugged at her face she said all right if im in town it was one of those moments in which i become very uncomfortable one of those times when nothing you say can be right and almost anything you do say is wrong i could see no answer but the classic croaker approach i began to back away that is how i handle my women duck for cover when they get distressed i almost made it to the door she could move when she wanted she crossed the gap and put her arms around me rested a cheek against my chest and that is how they handle me the sentimental fool the closet romantic i mean i dont even have to know them they can work that one on me when they really want to drill me they turn on the water i held her till she was ready to be let go we did not look at one another as i turned and went away so she hadnt gone for the heavy artillery she played fair mostly give her that even when she was the lady slick tricky but more or less fair the job of legate comes with all sorts of rights to subinfeudation and plunder of the treasury i had drafted that pack of tailors and turned them loose on the men i handed out commissions i waved my magic wand and oneeye and goblin became colonels hagop and otto turned into captains i even cast a glamor on murgen so that he looked like a lieutenant i drew us all three months pay in advance it all boggled the others i think one reason oneeye was anxious to get moving was an eagerness to get off somewhere where he could abuse his newfound privileges for the time being though he mostly bickered with goblin about whose commission carried the greater seniority those two never once questioned our shift in fortunes the weirdest part was when she called me in to present my commissions and insisted on a real name to enter into the record it took me a while to remember what my name was we rode out as threatened only we did not do it as the ragged band that rode in i travelled in a black iron coach drawn by six raging black stallions with murgen driving and otto and hagop riding as guards with a string of saddle horses trailing behind oneeye and goblin disdaining the coach rode before and behind upon mounts as fey and magnificent as the beasts which pulled the coach with twentysix horse guards as escort the horses she gave us were of a wild and wonderful breed hitherto given only to the greatest champions of her empire i had ridden one once long ago during the battle at charm when she and i had chased down soulcatcher they could run forever without tiring they were magical beasts they constituted a gift precious beyond belief how do these weird things happen to me a year earlier i was living in a hole in the ground under that boil on the butt of the world the plain of fear with fifty other men constantly afraid we would be discovered by the empire i had not had new or clean clothing in a decade and baths and shaves were as rare and dear as diamonds lying opposite me in that coach was a black bow the first gift she ever gave me so many years ago before the company deserted her it was precious in its own right how the wheel turns chapter six opal hagop stared as i finished primping gods you really look the part croaker otto said amazing what a bath and a shave will do i believe the word is distinguished looks like a supernatural miracle to me ott be sarcastic you guys i mean it otto said you do look good if you had a little rug to cover where your hairline is running back toward your butt he did mean it well then i mumbled uncomfortable i changed the subject i meant what i said keep those two in line in town only four days and already id bailed goblin and oneeye out of trouble twice there was a limit to what even a legate could cover hush and smooth over theres only three of us croaker hagop protested what do you want they dont want to be kept in line i know you guys youll think of something while youre at it get this junk packed up it has to go down to the ship yes sir your grand legateship sir i was about to deliver one of my fiery witty withering rejoinders when murgen stuck his head into the room and said the coach is ready croaker and hagop wondered aloud how do we keep them in line when we dont even know where they are nobodys seen them since lunchtime i went out to the coach hoping i would not get an ulcer before i got out of the empire we roared through opals streets my escort of horse guards my black stallions my ringing black iron coach and i sparks flew around the horses hooves and the coachs steel wheels dramatic but riding in that metal monster was like being locked inside a steel box that was being enthusiastically pounded by vandalistic giants we swept up to the gardens understated gate scattering gawkers i stepped down stood more stiffly erect than was my wont made an effete gesture of dismissal copied from some prince seen somewhere along lifes twisted way i strode through the gate thrown open in haste i marched back to the camelia grotto hoping ancient memory would not betray me gardens employees yapped at my heels i ignored them my way took me past a pond so smooth and silvery its surface formed a mirror i halted mouth dropping open i did indeed cut an imposing figure cleaned up and dressed up but were my eyes two eggs of fire and my open mouth a glowing furnace ill strangle those two in their sleep i murmured worse than the fire i had a shadow a barely perceptible specter behind me it hinted that the legate was but an illusion cast by something darker damn those two and their practical jokes when i resumed moving i noted that the gardens were packed but silent the guests all watched me i had heard that the gardens were not as popular as once they had been they were there to see me of course the new general the unknown legate out of the dark tower the wolves wanted a look at the tiger i should have expected it the escort they had had four days to tell tales around town i turned on all the outward arrogance i could muster and inside i echoed to the whimper of a kid with stage fright i settled in in the camelia grotto out of sight of the crowd shadows played about me the staff came to enquire after my needs they were revolting in their obsequiousness a disgusting little part of me gobbled it up a part just big enough to show why some men lust after power but not for me thank you i am too lazy and i am i fear the unfortunate victim of a sense of responsibility put me in charge and i try to accomplish the ends to which the office was allegedly created i guess i suffer from an impoverishment of the sociopathic spirit necessary to go big time how do you do the show with the multiplecourse meal when you are accustomed to patronizing places where you take whatever is in the pot or starve craft take advantage of the covey hovering about fearful i might devour them if not pleased ask this ask that use a physicians habitual intuition for the hinted and implied and i had it whipped i sent them to the kitchens with instructions to be in no haste for a companion might join me later not that i expected lady i was going through the motions i meant to keep my date without its other half other guests kept finding excuses to pass by and look at the new man i began to wish i had brought my escort along there was a rolling rumble like the sound of distant thunder then a hammerclap close at hand a wave of chatter ran through the gardens followed by gravedead silence then the silence gave way to the rhythm of steeltapped heels falling in unison i did not believe it even as i rose to greet her i did not believe it tower guards hove into view halted parted goblin came huptwothreeing between them strutting like a drum major looking like his namesake freshly scrounged from some especially fiery hell he glowed he trailed a fiery mist which evaporated a few yards behind him he stepped down into the grotto and gave the place the fisheye and me a wink he then marched up the far side steps and posted himself facing outward what the hell were they up to now expanding on their already overburdened practical joke then lady appeared as fell and as radiant as fantasy as beautiful as a dream i clicked my heels and bowed she descended to join me she was a vision she extended a hand my manners did not desert me despite all the hard years wouldnt this give opal fuel for gossip oneeye followed lady down wreathed in dark mists through which crawled shadows with eyes he inspected the grotto too as he turned to go back the way he had come i said im going to incinerate that hat tricked out like a lord he was but still wearing his ragpickers hat he grinned assumed his post have you ordered lady asked yes but only for one a small horde of staff tumbled past oneeye terrified the master of the gardens himself drove them if they had been fawning with me they were downright disgusting with lady i have never been that impressed with anyone in any position of power it was a long slow meal undertaken mostly in silence with me sending unanswered puzzled glances across the table a memorable dining experience for me though lady hinted that she had known better the problem was we were too much on stage to take any real enjoyment from it not only for the crowd but for one another along the way i admitted i had not expected her to appear and she said my storming out of the tower made her realize that if she did not just drop everything and go she would not shake the tentacles of imperial responsibility till someone freed her by murdering her so you just walked the place will be coming apart no i left certain safeguards in place i delegated powers to people whose judgment i trust in such fashion that the empire will acrete to them gradually and become theirs solidly before they realize that ive deserted i hope so i am a charter member of that philosophical school which believes that if anything can go sour it will it wont matter to us will it well be well out of range morally it matters if half a continent is thrown into civil war i think i have made sufficient moral sacrifice a cold wind overswept me why cant i keep my big damned mouth shut sorry i said youre right i didnt think apology accepted i must confess something ive taken a liberty with your plans eh one of my more intellectual moments i cancelled your passage aboard that merchantman what why it wouldnt be seemly for a legate of the empire to travel aboard a brokendown grain barge you are too cheap croaker the quinquireme soulcatcher built the dark wings is in port i ordered her readied for the crossing to beryl my gods the very doomship that brought us north we arent well loved in beryl beryl is an imperial province these days the frontier lies three hundred miles beyond the sea now have you forgotten your part in what made that possible i only wanted to no but my attention has been elsewhere the past few decades if the frontier had drifted that far then imperial boots tramped the asphalted avenues of my own home city it never occurred to me that the southern proconsuls might expand the borders beyond the maritime citystates only the jewel cities themselves were of any strategic value now whos being bitter who me youre right lets enjoy the civilized moment well have few enough of them our gazes locked for a moment there were sparks of challenge in hers i looked away how did you manage to enlist those two clowns in your charade a donative i laughed of course anything for money and how soon will the dark wings be ready to sail two days three at the most and no i wont be handling any imperial business while im here uhm good im stuffed to the gills and ripe for roasting we ought to go walk this off or something is there a reasonably safe place we could go you probably know opal better than i do croaker ive never been here before i suppose i looked surprised i cant be everywhere there was a time when i was preoccupied in the north and east a time when i was preoccupied with putting my husband down a time when i was preoccupied with catching you there never was a time when i was free for broadening travel thank the stars what meant to be a compliment on your youthful figure she gave me a calculating look i wont say anything to that youll stick it all in your annals i grinned threads of smoke snaked between my teeth i swore id get them chapter seven smoke and the woman willow figured you could pick smoke for what he was in any crowd he was a wrinkled skinny little geek that looked like somebody tried to do him in black walnut husk stain only they missed some spots there were spatters of pink on the backs of his hands one arm and one side of his face like maybe somebody threw acid at him and it killed the color where it hit him smoke had not done anything to willow not yet but willow did not like him blade did not care one way or another blade didnt care much about anybody cordy mather said he was reserving judgment willow kept his dislike back out of sight because smoke was what he was and because he hung out with the woman the woman was waiting for them too she was browner than smoke and most anyone else in town as far as willow knew she had a mean face that made it hard to look at her she was about average size for taglian women which was not very big by swans standards except for her attitude of i am the boss she would not have stood out much she did not dress better than old women willow saw in the streets black crows cordy called them always wrapped up in black like old peasant women they saw when they were headed down through the territories of the jewel cities they had not been able to find out who the woman was but they knew she was somebody she had connections in the prahbrindrahs palace right up at the top smoke worked for her fishwives didnt have wizards on the payroll anyway both of them acted like officials trying not to look official like they did not know how to be regular people the place they met was somebodys house somebody important but willow had not yet figured who the class lines and heirarchies did not make sense in taglios everything was always screwed up by religious affiliation he entered the room where they waited helped himself to a chair had to show them he wasnt some boy to run and fetch at their beck cordy and blade were more circumspect cordy winced as willow said blade says you guys want to kick it up bout smokes nightmares maybe pipe dreams you have a very good idea why you interest us mr swan taglios and its dependencies have been pacifistic for centuries war is a forgotten art its been unnecessary our neighbors were equally traumatized by the passage willow asked smoke she talking taglian as you wish mr swan willow caught a hint of mischief in the womans eye when the free companies came through they kicked ass so damned bad that for three hundred years anybody who even looked at a sword got so scared he puked his guts up yeah swan chuckled thats right we can talk tell us we want help mr swan willow mused lets see the way i hear around seventyfive a hundred years ago people finally started playing games archery shoots whatnot but never anything man to man then here come the shadowmasters to take over tragevec and kiaulune and change the names to shadowlight and shadowcatch kiaulune means shadow gate smoke said his voice was like his skin splotched with oddities squeaks sort of they made willow bristle not much change yes they came and like kina in the legend they set free the wicked knowledge in this case how to make war and right away they started carving them an empire and if they hadnt had that trouble at shadowcatch and hadnt got so busy fighting each other they wouldve been here fifteen years ago i know i been asking around ever since you guys started hustling us and so for fifteen years you knew they was coming someday and for fifteen years you aint done squat about it now when you all of a sudden know the day you want to grab three guys off the street and con them into thinking they can work some kind of miracle sorry sister willow swan aint buying theres your conjure man get old smoke to pull pigeons out of his hat we arent looking for miracles mr swan the miracle has happened smoke dreamed it were looking for time for the miracle to take effect willow snorted we have a realistic appreciation of how desperate our situation is mr swan we have had since the shadowmasters appeared we have not been playing ostrich we have been doing what seems most practical given the cultural context we have encouraged the masses to accept the notion that it would be a great and glorious thing to repel the onslaught when it comes you sold them that much blade said they ready to go die and thats all they would do swan said die why the woman asked no organization said cordy the thoughtful one but organization wouldnt be possible no one from any of the major cult families would take orders from somebody from another one exactly religious conflicts make it impossible to raise an army three armies maybe but then the high priests might be tempted to use them to settle scores here at home blade snorted they ought to burn the temples and strangle the priests sentiments my brother often expresses the woman said smoke and i feel they might follow outsiders of proven skill who arent beholden to any faction what you going to make me a general cordy laughed willow if the gods thought half as much of you as you think of yourself youd be king of the world you figure youre the miracle smoke saw in his dream theyre not going to make you a general not really unless maybe for show while they stall what whos the guy keeps saying he only spent two months in the army and never even learned to keep step oh willow thought for a minute i think i see actually you will be generals the woman said and well have to rely heavily on mr mathers practical experience but smoke will have the final say we have to buy time the wizard echoed a lot of time someday soon moonshadow will send a combined force of five thousand to invade taglios we have to keep from being beaten if theres any way possible we have to beat the force sent against us nothing like wishing are you willing to pay the price cordy asked like he thought it could be done the price will be paid the woman said whatever it may be willow looked at her till he could no longer keep his teeth clamped on the big question just who the hell are you lady making your promises and plans i am the radisha drah mr swan holy shit swan muttered the princes big sister the one some people said was the real boss bull in those parts i knew you was somebody but he was rattled right down to his toenails but he would not have been willow swan if he had not leaned back folded his hands on his belly put on a big grin and asked whats in it for us chapter eight opal crows though the empire retained a surface appearance of cohesion a failure of the old discipline snaked through the deeps beneath when you wandered the streets of opal you sensed the laxness there was flip talk about the new crop of overlords oneeye spoke of an increase in black marketeering a subject on which he had been expert for a century i overheard talk of crimes committed that were not officially sanctioned lady seemed unconcerned the empire is seeking normalcy the wars are over theres no need for the strictures of the past you saying its time to relax why not youd be the first to scream about what a price we paid for peace yeah but the comparative order the enforcement of public safety laws i admired that part you sweetheart croaker youre saying we werent all bad she knew damned well id claimed that all along you know i dont believe theres any such thing as pure evil yes there is its festering up north in a silver spike your friends drove into the trunk of a sapling thats the son of a god even the dominator may have had some redeeming quality sometime maybe he was good to his mother he probably ripped her heart out and ate it raw i wanted to say something like you married him but did not need to give her further excuses to change her mind she was pressed enough but i digress i was remarking on the changes in the ladys world what brought the whole thing home was having a dozen men drop in and ask if they could sign on with the black company they were all veterans which meant there were men of military age at loose ends these days during the war years there had been no extra bodies anywhere if they were not with the grey boys or that lot they were with the white rose i rejected six guys right away and accepted one a man with his front teeth done up in gold inlays goblin and oneeye selfappointed name givers dubbed him sparkle of the other five there were three i liked and two i did not and could find no sound reasons for going either way with any of them i lied and told them they were all in and should report aboard the dark wings in time for our departure then i conferred with goblin he said he would make sure that the two i did not like would miss our departure i first noticed the crows then consciously i attached no special significance just wondered why everywhere we went there seemed to be crows oneeye wanted a private chat you nosed around that place where your girlfriend is staying not to speak of i had given up arguing about whether or not lady was my girlfriend you ought to its a little late i take it you have whats your beef it isnt something you can pin down like sticking a nail through a frog croaker kind of hard to get a good look around there anyway what with she brought a whole damned army along an army that i think she figures on dragging along wherever we go she wont maybe she rules this end of the world but she dont run the black company nobody runs with this outfit who dont answer to me and only to me oneeye clapped that was good croaker i could almost hear the captain talking you even got to standing the way he did like a big old bear about to jump on something i was not original but i didnt think i was that transparent a borrower either so whats your point oneeye why has she got you spooked not spooked croaker just feeling cautious its her baggage shes dragging along enough stuff to fill a wagon women get that way aint womens stuff not unless she wears magical lacies youd know that better than me magical whatever that stuff is its got a charge on it a pretty hefty one what am i supposed to do about it he shrugged i dont know i just thought you ought to know if its magical its your department keep an eye out i snickered and let me know if you find anything useful your sense of humor has gone to hell croaker i know must be the company i keep my mother warned me about guys like you scat go help goblin give those two guys the runs or something and stay out of trouble or ill take you across the water in a nice bouncy rowboat well pull along behind the ship it takes some doing for a black man to get green around the gills oneeye managed it the threat worked he even kept goblin from getting into mischief though not in keeping with the time sequence i hereby make notation of four new members of the company they are sparkle big bucket red rudy and candles candles came with his name too there is a long story to tell how he got it it does not make sense and is not especially interesting being the new guys they mostly stayed quiet stayed out of the way did the scut work and worked on learning what we were all about lieutenant murgen was happy to have somebody around he outranked chapter nine across the screaming sea our black iron coaches roared through opals streets flooding the dawn with fear and thunder goblin outdid himself this time the black stallions breathed smoke and fire and flames sprang up where their hooves struck fading only after we were long gone citizens stayed under cover oneeye lolled beside me restrained by protective cords lady sat opposite us hands folded in her lap the lurching of the coach bothered her not at all her coach and mine parted ways hers headed for the north gate bound toward the tower all the city we hoped would believe her to be in that coach it would disappear somewhere in uninhabited country the coachmen handsomely bribed should head west to make new lives in the distant cities on the ocean coast the trail we hoped would be a dead one before anyone became concerned lady wore clothing that made her look like a doxy the legates momentary fancy she travelled like a courtesan the coach was jammed with her stuff and oneeye reported that a load had been delivered to the dark wings already with a wagon to carry it oneeye was limp because he had been drugged faced by a sea voyage he became balky he always does old in knowing oneeyes ways goblin had been prepared knockout drops in his morning brandy did the trick through wakening streets we thundered down to the waterfront amidst the confusion of arriving stevedores onto the massive naval dock we rolled to its very end and up a broad gangway hooves drummed on deck timbers finally we halted i stepped down from the coach the ships captain met me with all the appropriate honors and dignities and a furious scowl on behalf of his savaged deck i looked around the four new men were there i nodded the captain shouted hands began casting off others began helping my men unharness and unsaddle horses i noticed a crow perched on the masthead small tugs manned by convict oarsmen pulled the dark wings off the pier her own sweeps came out drums pounded the beat she turned her bows seaward in an hour we were well down the channel running with the tide the ships great black sail bellied with an offshore breeze the device thereon was unchanged since our northward journey though soulcatcher had been destroyed by the lady herself soon after the battle at charm the crow kept its perch it was the best season for crossing the sea of torments even oneeye admitted it was a swift and easy passage we raised the beryl light on the third morning and entered the harbor with the afternoon tide the advent of the dark wings had all the impact i expected and feared the last time that monster put in at beryl the citys last free homegrown tyrant had died his successor chosen by soulcatcher became an imperial puppet and his successors were imperial governors local imperial functionaries swarmed onto the pier as the quinquireme warped in termites goblin called them tax farmers and penpushers little things that live under rocks and shy from the light of honest employment somewhere in his background was a cause for a big hatred of tax collectors i understand in an intellectual sort of way i mean there is no lower human lifeform with the possible exception of pimps than that which revels in its statederived power to humiliate extort and generate misery i am left with a disgust for my species but with goblin it can become a flaming passion with him trying to work everybody up to go out and treat a few tax people to grotesque excruciations and deaths the termites were shaken and distressed they did not know what to make of this sudden obviously portentous arrival the advent of an imperial legate could mean a hundred things but nothing good for the entrenched bureaucracy elsewhere all work came to a halt even cursing gang leaders paused to stare at the harbinger ship oneeye eyeballed the situation better get us out of town fast croaker else it will turn into the tower all over again this time with too many people asking too damned many questions the coach was ready lady was inside the mounts both great and normal were saddled a small light closed wagon was brought up and assembled by the horse guards and filled with ladys plunder we were ready to roll when the ships captain was ready to let us mount up i ordered oneeye when that gangway goes down you make like the horns of hell otto take this coach off here like the limper himself is after you i turned to the commander of the horse guards you break trail dont give those people down there a chance to slow us down i boarded the coach wise thinking lady said get away fast or risk falling into the trap i barely escaped at the tower thats what im afraid of i can fake this legate business only if nobody looks at me too close far better to roar through town and leave them thinking me a foultempered contemptuous arrogant taken legate southward bound on a mission that was no business of the procurators of beryl the gangway slammed down oneeye let loose the hellhorn howl i wanted my mob surged forward gawkers and the privileged alike scattered before our fireanddarkness apparition we thundered through beryl as we had thundered through opal our passage spreading terror behind us the dark wings put out with the evening tide under orders to proceed to the garnet roads and begin an extended patrol against pirates and smugglers we exited the rubbish gate though the normal animals were exhausted we carried on till darkness lent us its mask despite our haste to get away from the city we did not camp far enough out to escape its attention entirely when i wakened in the morning i found murgen waiting on me with three brothers who wanted to join up their names were cletus longinus and loftus they had been kids when we were in beryl before how they recognized us during our wild ride i do not know they claimed to have deserted the urban cohorts in order to join us i did not feel much like dealing with an extensive interrogation so took murgens word that they seemed all right theyre fools enough to want to jump in with us without knowing whats going on let them give them to hagop i now had two feeble squads otto and the four from opal and hagop and the three from beryl such was the companys history pick up a man here enlist two there keep on keeping on southward and southward through rebosa where the company had seen service briefly and where otto and hagop had enlisted they found their city changed immensely and yet not at all they had no trouble leaving it behind they brought in another man there a nephew who quickly earned the name smiley because of his consistent sullenness and sarcastic turn of phrase then padora and on to that great crossroads of trade routes where i was born and where i enlisted just before the company ended its service there i was young and foolish when i did yes but i did get to see the far reaches of the world i ordered a day of rest at the vast caravan camp outside the city wall along the westward road while i went into town and indulged myself walking streets i had run as a kid like otto said about rebosa the same and yet dramatically changed the difference of course was inside me i stalked through the old neighborhood past the old tenement i saw no one i knew unless a woman glimpsed briefly who looked like my grandmother was my sister i did not confront her nor ask to those people i am dead a return as imperial legate would not change that we stood before the last imperial mile marker lady was trying to convince the lieutenant commanding our guards that his mission was complete that imperial soldiers crossing the frontier might be construed as an unacceptable provocation sometimes her people are too loyal a halfdozen border militiamen equally divided between sides clad identically and obviously old friends stood around a short distance away discussing us in murmurs of awe the rest of us fidgeted it seemed ages since i had been beyond imperial frontiers i found the prospect vaguely unsettling you know what were doing croaker goblin asked whats that were travelling backward in time backward in time backward into our own history a simple enough statement but an important thought yeah maybe youre right let me go stir the pot else well never get moving i joined lady who gave me a nasty look i pasted on my sweetest smile and said look here im over on the other side of the line you got a problem lieutenant he bobbed his head he was more in awe of my rank and title unearned though they were than he was of the woman who was supposed to be his boss and that was because he believed he owed her certain duties even she could not overrule the company has openings for a few good men with military experience i said now that were out of the empire and dont have to have the imperial permission were actively recruiting he caught on real fast skipped across beside me gave lady a big grin there is one thing i said you come over here and do it youre going to have to take the oath to the company same as anybody else meaning you cant pledge yourself to any higher loyalty lady gave him a nastysweet smile he stepped back across figuring hed better do some serious thinking before he committed himself i told lady that goes for everybody i would not presume before but if you come out of the empire and continue to ride with us it will be under the same conditions accepted by everyone else such a look she gave me but im just a woman not a precedent friend it didnt happen often the world dont have much room for female adventurers but women have marched with the company turning to the lieutenant i said and if you sign on your oath will be taken as genuine first time you get an order and look to her for advice on yes or no out you go alone in a foreign land it was one of my more assertive days lady muttered some very unladylike sniggen snaggen riddly rodden racklesnatzes under her breath then told the lieutenant go talk it over with your men the moment he was out of hearing she demanded does this mean we stop being friends if i take your damned oath do you reckon i stopped being friends with the others when they elected me captain i admit i dont hear a lot of yes sir no sir your worship sir but you do see them do what theyre told when they know i mean what i say most of the time goblin and oneeye need a little extra convincing once in a while whats it going to be you going to be a soldier do i have a choice croaker you can be a bastard of course you have a choice you can go back with your men and be the lady the lieutenant was talking to his troops and the idea of going on south was proving less popular than he or i had thought it would most of the bunch started getting their horses together facing north before he finished talking he finally came over and presented us with six men who wanted to go on with us he did not include himself with the group evidently his conscience had shown him a way around doing what he considered to be his duty minutes before i questioned the men briefly and they did seem interested in going on so i brought them over the line and swore them all in making a production of it for ladys sake i do not recall doing anything particularly formal for anyone else before i gave the six to otto and hagop for dividing between them and kept the one for me and later entered their names into the annals when we learned how they wanted to be known lady remained content to be called lady it sounded like a name when heard by speakers of any language but one anyway crows watched the whole show from a nearby tree chapter ten shadowmasters though the sun stared in through a dozen vaulted windows there was darkness in that place where darkness met a pool of molten stone simmered in the center of the vast floor it cast bloody light upon four seated figures floating a few feet in the air they faced one another over the pool forming an equilateral triangle with a couple at its apex those two were leagued more often than not they were allied now there had been war among the four for a long time with nothing gained one in relation to another but at the moment there was an armistice shadows slithered and swirled and pranced around them nothing could be seen of any of them except vague shapes all four chose to conceal themselves within robes of black behind black masks the smallest one of the couple broke a silence that had reigned an hour she has begun moving south those who served her and still bear her indelible mark are moving also they have crossed the sea and they come bearing mighty talismans and their road is strewn with those who would join their destinies to that black standard including some whose power we would be foolish not to beware one angle of the triangle made a sound of contempt the other asked and what of the one in the north the great one remains secure the lesser one who lay in the shade of the prisoning tree does so no longer it has been resurrected and given new form it comes south too but it is so insane and vengeancestarved that it is not to be feared a child could dispose of it have we cause to fear that our presence here is known none even in trogo taglios only a few are convinced that we exist beyond the first cataract we are but a rumor and not that above the second but he who has made himself master in the great swamps may have sensed us stirring it is possible he suspects there is more afoot than he knew the reporters companion added they come she comes but harnessed to the pace of man and animal we still have a year or more the one snorted again then spoke the swamps would be a very good place for them to die take care of it you may impress the one who rules them with the majesty and terror of my name he began to drift away the others stared hard the anger in the place became palpable the other ceased his drift you know what sleeps so restlessly upon my southern border i dare not relax my vigilance unless to stab another of us in the back i note that the threat becomes secondary whenever you care to try you have my pledge upon my name the peace will not be broken by me while those who bring danger from the north survive you may speak of me as one with you when you extend your hands beyond the shadows i cannot i dare not give you more he resumed his drift so be it then said the woman the triangle rearranged itself so as to exclude him he spoke one truth certainly the swamps would be a very good place for them to die if fate does not take them in hand sooner one of the others began to chuckle the shadows scurried about frantic as growing laughter tormented them a very good place for them to die chapter eleven a march into yesteryear at first the names were echoes from my childhood kale fratter grey weeks some the company had served some had been its foes the world changed and became warmer and the cities became more scattered their names faded to legend and memories from the annals tire raxle slight nab and nod we passed beyond any map i had ever seen to cities known to me only through the annals and visited only by oneeye previously boros teries viege hajah and still we headed south still making the first long leg of our journey crows followed we gathered another four recruits professional caravan guards from a nomad tribe called the roi who deserted to join us i started a squad for murgen he was not thrilled he was content being standard bearer and had developed hopes of taking over the annalists chores from me because i had so much to do as captain and medic i dared not discourage him the only alternative substitute was oneeye he was not reliable and south some more and still we were not back to oneeyes origin the jungles of dloc aloc oneeye swore that never in his life outside the company had he heard the name khatovar it had to lie far beyond the waist of the world there are limits to what frail flesh can endure those long leagues were not easy the black iron coach and ladys wagon drew the eye of bandits and princes and princes who were bandits most times goblin and oneeye bluffed us through the rest of the time we forced them to back down with a little applied terror there was one long stretch where the magic had gone away if those two had learned anything during their years with the company it was showmanship when they conjured an illusion you could smell its bad breath from seventy feet away i wished they would refrain from wasting that flash upon one another i decided it was time we laid up for a few days we needed to regain our youthful bounce oneeye suggested theres a place down the road called the temple of travellers repose they take in wanderers they have for two thousand years it would be a good place to lay up and do some research research two thousand years of travellers tales makes a hell of a library croaker and a tale is the only donative they ever require he had me he grinned cockily the old scoundrel knew me too well nothing else could have stilled my determination to reach khatovar so thoroughly i passed the word and gave oneeye the fisheye that means youre going to do some honest work what who do you think is going to translate he groaned and rolled his eye when am i going to learn to keep my big damned mouth shut the temple was a lightly fortified monastery sprawled atop a low hill it looked golden in the light of a late afternoon sun the forest beyond and the fields before were as intense a dark green as ever i have seen the place looked restful as we entered a wave of wellbeing cleansed us a feeling of i have come home washed over us i looked at lady the things i felt glowed in her face and touched my heart i could retire here i told lady two days into our stay clean for the first time in months we stalked a garden never disturbed by conflicts more weighty than the squabbles of sparrows she gave me a thin smile and did me the courtesy of saying nothing about the delusive nature of dreams the place had everything i thought i wanted comfort quiet isolation from the ills of the earth purpose challenging historical studies to soothe my lust to know what had gone on before most of all it provided a respite from responsibility each man added to the company seemed to double my burden as i worried about keeping them fed keeping them healthy and out of trouble crows i muttered what everywhere we go therere crows maybe i only started noticing them the past couple months but everywhere we go i see crows and i cant shake the feeling theyre watching us lady gave me a puzzled look look right over there in that acacia tree two of them squatting there like black omens she glanced at the tree gave me another look i see a couple of doves but one of the crows launched itself flapped away over the monastery wall that wasnt any croaker oneeye charged through the garden scattering the birds and squirrels ignoring all propriety hey croaker guess what i found copies of the annals from when we came past here headed north well and well this tired old mind cannot find words adequate excitement certainly ecstasy youd better believe the moment was almost sexually intense my mind focused the way ones does when an especially desirable woman suddenly seems attainable several older volumes of the annals had become lost or damaged during the years there were some id never seen and never had known a hope of seeing where i breathed in the library one of the monks thought you might be interested when we were here heading north i dont remember leaving them but i wasnt much interested in that kind of thing then me and tomtom was too busy looking over our shoulders i might be interested i said i might my manners deserted me i deserted lady without so much as an excuse me maybe that obsession was not as powerful as id worked it up to be i felt like an ass when i realized what i had done reading those copies required teamwork they had been recorded in a language no longer used by anyone but the temple monks none of them spoke any language i understood so our reader translated into oneeyes native tongue then oneeye translated for me what filtered through was damned interesting they had the book of choe which had been destroyed fifty years before i enlisted and only poorly reconstructed and the book of telare known to me only through a cryptic reference in a later volume the book of skete previously unknown they had a half dozen more equally precious but no book of the company no first or second book of odrick those were the legendary first three volumes of the annals containing our origin myths referenced in later works but not mentioned as having been seen after the first century of the companys existence the book of telare tells why there was a battle always there was a battle in any explanation movement a clash of arms another punctuation mark in the long tale of the black company in this one the people who had hired our forebrethren had bolted at the first shock of the enemys charge they had broken so fast they were gone before the company realized what was happening the outfit beat a fighting retreat into its fortified encampment during the ensuing siege the enemy penetrated the camp several times during one such penetration the volumes in question vanished both the annalist and his understudy were slain the books could not be reconstructed from memory oh well i was ahead of the game books available charted our future almost to the edge of the maps owned by the monks and those ran all the way to here there be dragons another century and a half of a journey into our yesterdays by the time we retraced our route that far i hoped we would stand at the heart of a map that encompassed our destination as soon as it was clear that we had struck gold i obtained writing materials and a virgin volume of the annals i could write as fast as oneeye and the monk could translate time fled a monk brought candles then a hand settled on my shoulder lady said do you want to take a break i could do that for a while for half a minute i just sat there turning red that after i practically ditched her outside after i never even thought of her all day she told me i understand maybe she did she had read the various books of croaker or as posterity might recall them the books of the north several times with murgen and lady spelling me the translation went quickly the only practical limit was oneeyes endurance it was not all one way i had to trade my later annals for their older ones lady sweetened the deal with a few hundred anecdotes about the dark empire of the north but the monks never connected my lady with the queen of darkness oneeye is a tough old buzzard he held up four days after he made his great discovery the job was done i let murgen into the game but he did all right and i had to beg buy four blank journals in order to get everything transcribed lady and i resumed our stroll about where we had broken it but with me a little down whats the matter she chided and to my astonishment wanted to know if it was a postcoital depression just the faintest of digs there i think no ive just found out a ton about the companys history but i didnt learn anything thats really new she understood but she kept quiet and let me articulate my dissatisfaction its told a hundred ways poorly and well according to the skill of the particular annalist but except for the occasional interesting detail it was the same old march countermarch fight celebrate or run away record the dead and sooner or later get even with the sponsor for betraying us even at that place with the unpronounceable name where the company was in service for fiftysix years geaxle she got her mouth around it like she had had practice yeah there where the contract lasted so long the company almost lost its identity intermarrying with the population and all that becoming a sort of hereditary bodyguard with arms handed down from father to son but as it always will the essential moral destitution of those wouldbe princes made itself evident and somebody decided to cheat us he got his throat cut and the company moved on you certainly read selectively croaker i looked at her she was laughing at me quietly yeah well id stated it pretty baldly a prince did try to cheat our forebrethren and did get his throat cut but the company installed a new friendly beholden dynasty and did hang around a few years before that captain got a wild hair and decided to go treasure hunting you have no reservations about commanding a band of hired killers she asked sometimes i admitted sliding past the trap nimbly but we never cheated a sponsor not exactly sooner or later every sponsor cheated us including yours truly one of your satraps beat you to it but given time we would have become less than indispensable and you would have started looking around for a way to shaft us instead of doing the honorable thing and paying us off and simply terminating our commission thats what i love about you croaker your unflagging faith in humanity absolutely every ounce of my cynicism is supported by historical precedent i grumped you really know how to melt a woman you know that croaker huh i come armed with a whole arsenal of such brilliant repartee i came out here with some feebleminded notion of seducing you for some reason im not in the mood to try anymore well some of them you screw up royal there was an observation catwalk along some parts of the monastery wall i went up into the northeast corner leaned on the adobe and stared back the way we had come busy feeling sorry for myself every couple hundred years that sort of thing leads to a productive insight the damned crows were thicker than ever must have been twenty of them now i cursed them and i swear they mocked me when i threw a loose piece of adobe they all jumped up and fled toward goblin i think he was out keeping an eye on me in case i got suicidal yeah get oneeye and lady and come up here fast i turned and stared up the slope at the thing that had caught my eye it stopped moving but was unmistakably a human figure in robes so black looking at them was like looking at a rent in the fabric of existence it carried something under its right arm about the size of a hatbox held in place by the natural fall of the limb the crows swarmed around it twenty or thirty of them squabbling over the right to perch upon its shoulders it was a good quarter mile from where i stood but i felt the gaze from its hooded unseen face beating upon me like the heat from a furnace the crowd turned up with goblin and oneeye as quarrelsome as ever lady asked what is it take a look out there they looked goblin squeaked so so what do you mean so whats so interesting about an old tree stump and a flock of birds i looked damn a stump but as i stared there was an instants shimmer and i saw the black figure again i shuddered croaker lady asked she was still mad at me but concerned even so nothing my eyes were playing tricks on me i thought i saw the damned thing moving forget it they took me at my word stomped off to whatever they had been doing i watched them go and for another moment doubted my own senses but then i looked again the crows were flying off in a crowd except for two headed straight toward me and the stump was hiking off across the hillside as though intent on circling the monastery i mumbled a little to myself but it did not do any good i tried giving the temple a few more days to work its magic but the next one hundred fifty years of our journey drummed on in my mind there was no repose now i was too itchy to sit i announced my intention and i got no kickbacks just acquiescent nods maybe even relieved nods what was this i sat up and came out of myself where i had been spending a lot of time reexamining the familiar old furniture i had not been paying attention to the others they were restless too there was something in the air something that told us all it was time to hit the road even the monks seemed eager to see us move out curious them that stays alive in the soldiering business are them that listens to such feelings even when they make no sense you feel like you got to move you move you stay put and get stomped it is too late to whine about all that work for nothing chapter twelve the shaggy hills to reach oneeyes jungle we had to pass through several miles of woods then climb over a range of decidedly odd hills the hills were very round very steep and completely treeless though not especially high they were covered with a short brown grass that caught fire easily so that many bore black scars from a distance they looked like a herd of giant tawny humped beasts sleeping i was in a state of high nerves that sleepingbeast image haunted me i kept half expecting those hills to waken and shrug us off i caught up with oneeye is there something weird about these hills that you accidentally forgot to tell me about on purpose he gave me a funny look no though the ignorant believe them to be burial mounds from a time when giants walked the earth but they arent theyre just hills all dirt and rock inside then why do they make me feel funny he glanced back the way we had come puzzled its not the hills croaker its something back there i feel it too like we just dodged an arrow i did not ask him what it was he would have told me if he had known as the day wore on i realized the others were as jumpy as i was worrying about it did as much good as worrying ever does next morning we ran into two wizened little men of oneeyes race they both looked a hundred years old one of them kept hacking and coughing like he was about to croak goblin cackled must be old lizard lipss illegitimate grandchildren there was a resemblance i suppose that was to be expected we were just accustomed to oneeye being unique oneeye scowled at goblin keep it up barf bag youll be grocery shopping with the turtles what the hell did that mean some kind of obscure shop talk but goblin was as croggled as the rest of us grinning oneeye resumed gabbling with his relatives lady said i presume these are the guides the monks sent for they had done us that favor on learning our intentions we would need guides we were near the end of any road we could call familiar once past oneeyes jungle we would need somebody to translate for oneeye too goblin let out a sudden aggrieved squawk whats your problem i demanded hes feeding them a pack of lies so what was new about that how do you know you dont talk that lingo i dont have to ive known him since before your dad was whelped look at him hes doing his classic mightysorcererfromafarawayland act in about twenty seconds hes going to a wicked grin spread his mouth around his face he muttered something under his breath oneeye raised a hand a ball of light formed within his curled fingers there was a pop like that of a cork coming out of a wine bottle oneeye held a hand full of swamp bottom it oozed between his fingers and ran down his arm he lowered his hand and stared in disbelief he let out a shriek and whirled innocent goblin was faking a conversation with murgen but murgen was not up to the deceit his shifty eyes gave goblin away oneeye puffed up like a toady frog ready to explode then a miracle occurred he invented selfrestraint a nasty little smile pranced across his lips and he turned back to the guides that was the second time in my experience that he had controlled himself when provoked but then it was one of those rare times when goblin had initiated the process of provocation i told otto this could get interesting otto grunted an affirmative he was not thrilled of oneeye i asked have you finished telling them youre the necromancer voice of the north wind come to ease the pain in their hearts brought on by worry about their wealth hed actually tried to sell that once to a tribe of savages coincidentally in possession of an eyepopping cache of emeralds he found out the hard way that primitive does not mean stupid they were fixing to burn him at the stake when goblin decided to bail him out against his better judgment he always insisted afterward it aint like that this time croaker i wouldnt do it to my own people oneeye does not have an ounce of shame nor even the sense not to lie to those who know him well of course he would do it to his own people he would do it to anybody if he thought he could get away with it and he has so little trouble conning himself on that see that you dont were too few and too far from safety to let you indulge yourself in your usual line of shit i got enough menace into my voice to make him gulp his tone was markedly different when he resumed gobbling at our prospective guides even so i decided i would pick up a smatter of the language just to keep an ear on him his often misplaced selfconfidence has a way of asserting itself at the most unpropitious moments straight for a time oneeye negotiated a deal that pleased everyone we had ourselves guides for the passage through the jungle and intermediary interpreters for the land that lay beyond relying on his usual moronic sense of humor goblin dubbed them baldo and wheezer for reasons that were selfevident to my embarrassment the names stuck those two old boys probably deserved better but then again we wended our way belween the shaggy humpbacked hills the rest of that day and as darkness approached we topped the cleavage between the pair that flanked the summit of our passage from there we could see the sunset reflecting bloody wounds of a broad river and the rich green of the jungle beyond behind us lay the tawny humps and beyond them a hazy sprawl of indigo my mood was reflective flat almost down it seemed we might have reached a watershed in more than a geographical sense much later unable to sleep for thoughts that questioned what i was doing here in an alien land thoughts that replied that i had nothing else to do and nowhere else to go i left my bedroll and the remaining warmth of our campfire i headed for one of the flanking hills moved by some vague notion of going up where i could get a better view of the stars wheezer who had the watch gave me a gaptoothed leer before spitting a wad of brown juice into the coals i heard him start wheezing before i was halfway up the hill a lunger i got yet the moon threatened to rise soon it would be fat and bright i picked me a spot and stood looking at the horizon waiting for that fat orange globe to roll over the lip of the world the faintest of cool moist breezes stirred my hair it was so damned peaceful it hurt you couldnt sleep either i jerked around she was a dark glob on the hillside just ten feet away if i had noted her at all it was as a rock i stepped closer she was seated her arms wrapped around her knees her gaze was fixed on the north sit down i sat what are you looking at so hard the reaper the archer vargos ship and yesterdays no doubt those were constellations i considered them too they were very low seen from here this time of year they would be quite high in the sky up north what she meant began to sink in we had come a far piece indeed with many a mile to go she said its intimidating when you think about it its a lot of walking it was the moon clambered over the horizon monstrous in size and almost red she whispered wow and slipped her hand into mine she was shivering so after a minute i slid over and put my arm around her she leaned her head against my shoulder that old moon was working its magic that sucker can do it to anybody now i knew what made wheezer grin the moment seemed right i turned my headand her lips were rising to meet mine when they touched mine i forgot who and what she had been her arms surrounded me pulled me down she shivered in my grasp like a captive mouse what is it i whispered shh she said and that was the best thing she could have said but she could not leave it there she had to add i never i never did this well shit she sure knew how to distract a man and put a thousand reservations into his mind that moon climbed the sky we began to relax with each other somehow there were fewer rags separating us she stiffened the mist went out of her eyes she lifted her head and stared past me face slack if one of those clowns had sneaked up to watch i was going to break his kneecaps i turned we did not have company she was watching the flash of a distant storm heat lightning i said you think so it doesnt seem much farther off than the temple and we never saw a storm the whole time we were crossing that country jagged lightning bolts ripped down like a fall of javelins that feeling i had discussed with oneeye redoubled i dont know croaker she began gathering her clothing the pattern seems familiar i followed her lead relieved i am not sure i would have been able to finish what we started i was distracted now another time will be better i think she said still staring at that lightning that is too distracting we returned to camp to find everyone awake yet totally uninterested in the fact that we had been away together the view was not as good from below but flashes could be seen they did not let up theres sorcery out there croaker oneeye said goblin nodded the heavy stuff you can feel the screaming edges of it from here how far away i asked about two days close to that place we stopped i shivered can you tell what its about goblin said nothing oneeye shook his head all i can tell you is im glad im here and not there i agreed even in my ignorance of what was happening murgen blanched he pointed over the book he was studying which he held out like a protective fetish did you see that i was looking at lady and brooding about my luck the others could sweat the little stuff like some bloody sorcerers duel fifty miles away i had troubles of my own what i grumbled knowing he wanted a response it looked like a giant bird i mean like one with a twentymile wingspan that you could see through i looked up goblin nodded he had seen it too i looked to the north the lightning ended but some pretty fierce fires had to be burning up there oneeye your new buddies there got any idea whats going on the little black man shook his head he had the brim of his hat pulled forward cutting his line of sight that business up there whatever it was had him rattled by his own admission he is the greatest wizard ever produced by his part of the world with the possible exception of his dead brother tomtom whatever that was out there it was alien it did not belong times change i suggested not around here they dont and if they did these guys would know about it wheezer nodded vigorous agreement although he could not have understood a word he hawked and spat a brown glob into the fire i had a feeling i was going to have as much fun with him as i did with oneeye what is that crap hes all the time chewing its disgusting qat oneeye said a mild narcotic doesnt do his lungs any good but when hes chewing it he doesnt care how much they hurt him he said it lightly but he meant it i nodded uncomfortably looked away quieting down up there no one had anything to say to that were all awake i said so get packing i want to move out as soon as we can see to walk i did not get a bit of argument wheezer nodded and spat goblin grunted and started getting his things together the others followed his example murgen putting the book away with a care that i approved the boy might make an annalist after all we all kept sneaking looks at the north when we thought our uneasiness would go unnoticed when i was not looking that way or tormenting myself with glances at lady i tried to get an estimate of the reactions of the newer men we had encountered no sorcery directly yet but the company has a way of stumbling into its path they seemed no more uncomfortable than the old hands glances at lady i wondered if what seemed inevitable on the one hand and foredoomed on the other would ever cease crackling between us so long as it did it would distort everything else in our relationship hell i liked her fine as a friend there is nothing so unreasonable and irrational and blind and just plain sillylooking as a man who works himself into an obsessive passion women do not look as foolish they are expected to be weak but they are also expected to become savage bitches when they are frustrated chapter thirteen willows last night little willow cordy mather and blade still had their tavern mainly because they had the countenance of the prahbrindrah drah business wasnt good now the priests found out they couldnt control the foreigners so they put them off limits a lot of taglians did what the priests told them shows you how much sense people have blade said they had any they would take the priests to the river and hold them under an hour to remind them they drone like termites willow said man you got to be the sourest son of a bitch i ever seen i bet if we hadnt dragged you out those crocs would of thrown you back too rancid to eat blade just grinned as he went through the door to the back room willow asked cordy you reckon it was priests that throwed him in yeah good house tonight for once yeah tomorrows the day willow took a long drink cordys brew was getting better then he stood up and hammered the bar with his empty mug in taglian he said we who are about to die salute you drink and be merry children for tomorrow and so forth on the house he sat down cordy said you know how to cheer a place up dont you you figure we got anything to be cheerful about theyll screw it up you know they will all those priests mucking about in it i tell you right out i get my chance theres a couple accidentally aint going to come back from out there cordy nodded and kept his mouth shut willow swan was a lot more bark than bite swan grumbled up the river if this works out ill tell you something cordy these feet get to moving that direction theyre just going to keep on shuffling sure willow sure you dont believe me do you i believe everything you tell me willow if i didnt would i be here up to my neck wallowing in rubies and pearls and gold doubloons man what do you expect of someplace nobody ever heard of six thousand miles past the edge of any map anybody ever seen blade came back nerves getting you guys nerves what nerves they didnt put no nerves in when they made willow swan chapter fourteen through dloc aloc we moved out as soon as there was a ghost of light it was an easy downhill trail with only a few places where we had trouble with the coach and ladys wagon by noon we reached the first trees an hour later the first contingent were aboard a ferry raft before sundown we were inside the jungle of dloc aloc where only ten thousand kinds of bugs tormented our bodies worse on our nerves than their buzzing though was oneeyes suddenly inexhaustible store of praises and tales of his homeland from my first day in the company i had been trying to get a fix on him and his country every lousy detail had had to be pried out now it was everything anyone ever wanted to know and more except specifics of why he and his brother had run away from such a paradise from where i sat swatting myself the answer to that seemed selfevident only madmen and fools would subject themselves to such continuous torment so which was i for all there was a route through we spent almost two months in that jungle the jungle itself was the biggest problem it was huge and getting the coach through was shall we say politely a chore but the people were a problem too not that they were unfriendly too much the opposite their ways were much easier than ours in the north those sleek delectable little brown beauties had never seen anything like murgen and otto and hagop and their boys they all wanted a taste of novelty the guys were cooperative even goblin got lucky often enough to keep an eartoear grin on his ugly clock poor hapless inhibited old croaker planted himself firmly among the spectators and longed his heart out i do not have the hair it takes to pursue a little casual funtime bouncybouncy while a more serious proposition is watching from the wings my attitude caused no direct verbal comment those guys have some tact sometimes but i caught enough snide sidelongs to know what they were thinking and them thinking made me think when i get introspective i can become broody and unfit company for man or beast and when i know i am being watched a natural shyness or reluctance sets in and i do not do anything no matter how auspicious the omens so i sat around on my hands getting depressed because i feared something important might be slipping away and i was constitutionally incapable of doing anything about it life sure was less complicated in the old days my temper improved after we scaled a last excessively vegetated and overly buginfested mountain range and broke out of the jungle onto high plateau savannah from there one of the more interesting aspects of dloc aloc seemed to be the fact that we had not attracted a single volunteer soldier it said something about the peace the people had with their environment and something about oneeye and his longgone brother what the hell had they done i noticed he made a point of avoiding any talk about his past his age or his earlier identity while in the jungle with baldo and wheezer like anybody would remember something a couple of teenagers had done that long ago baldo and wheezer planted us as soon as they had us outside the country of their own people they claimed they had reached the limit of territory they knew baldo announced that he was going to turn back despite his earlier contract something had happened to disenchant baldo i did not argue with him his mind was made up i just did not pay him the full fee he had been promised i was thrilled that wheezer was going to stay that guy was a secondrate soul son of oneeye full of ridiculous mischief maybe there is something in the water in the jungle of dloc aloc except that baldo and everyone else we met was almost normal i guess my magnetic personality draws the oneeye wheezer types for sure there was fun in the offing oneeye had been taking it from goblin for two months with never a spark in response when the blowup came it was sure to be a beauty the whole thing is backwards i said as lady and i mulled things over oneeye is supposed to pick at scabs while goblin lays in the weeds waiting like a snake maybe its because weve crossed the equator the seasons are reversed i did not understand that remark until i had given it hours of thought then i realized that it had no meaning it was one of her droll deadpan jokes chapter fifteen the savannah we waited six days at the edge of the savannah twice bands of darkskinned warriors came to look us over the first time wheezer told us dont let them lure you off the road he said it to oneeye not knowing that i had picked up enough of the chatter to follow what they said i have a fair gift for tongues most of us old hands do we have to learn so many what road oneeye demanded that cow path he indicated a track that meandered into the distance whatever is between the white stones is the road the road is holy as long as you stay on it youll be safe on first pitching camp we were warned not to leave a circle circumscribed by white stones i guessed the significance of the lines of white stones running southward trade would demand sheltered routes though little trade seemed to be moving these days seldom had we encountered any sizable caravan heading north since leaving the empire we saw no one headed south except perhaps a walking stump wheezer continued beware the plains peoples anyway they are treacherous they will employ every blandishment and deceit imaginable to draw you outside their women are especially notorious remember they are always watching to leave the road is death lady was intensely interested in the discussion she understood too and goblin cracked youre dead maggot lips what oneeye squeaked the first set of sweet hips that shakes your way will lead you right off to the cannibals cookpots they arent cannibals sudden panic tautened oneeyes face it took him that long to realize that goblin had understood him while he was talking with wheezer he looked at the rest of us some of us gave ourselves away he looked that much more distraught he whispered to wheezer with great animation wheezer cackled his laugh seemed half chicken cluck half peacock call it cost him a coughing fit it was a bad one oneeye beckoned me youre sure you cant do something for this guy croaker he busts a lung and dies were hurting nothing he shouldnt be traipsing around to begin with no point singing that song wheezer refused to hear it you or goblin ought to be able to do him more good than i can you cant help a guy who wont let you aint it the truth i said looking him straight in the eye how long before we get us some guides all i hear is soon when i ask soon indeed a pair of tall black men came up the road at a steady hardy trot they were the sleakest healthiest specimens i had seen in a long time each carried a sheaf of javelins across his back a shorthafted longbladed spear in his right hand and a shield of some white and black striped hide upon his left arm their limbs moved in perfect cadence as though each man was half of some marvelous rhythmic machine i glanced at lady no thoughts were evident on her face they would make grand soldiers she said the two trotted straight to wheezer feigning a vast indifference to the rest of us but i felt them studying us sidelong white people had to be rare this side of the jungle they barked at wheezer in an arrogant tongue filled with clicks and stops wheezer did some heavy kowtowing he responded in the same language whining like a slave addressing an illtempered master trouble lady prophesied righto this contempt for the outsider was not a new experience i had to get busy and establish who said jump and who asked how high i talked to goblin using the finger speech of the deaf oneeye caught it he cackled that stirred our new guides indignation it would be touchy they had to give me what they themselves knew was provocation only then would they accept being put in their place oneeye was getting big ideas i signed him to restrain himself to prepare some impressive illusion aloud i demanded whats all the babble get into the middle of that he started nagging wheezer wheezer carried on like a man caught between a rock and a hard place he told oneeye that the khlata did not bargain he said they would go through our things and pick out what they thought was worth their trouble they try that and theyll get their fingers bitten off at the elbow tell them that politely it was too late for polite those guys understood the language but oneeyes growling threw them they did not know what to do next croaker murgen called company company indeed some of the boys who had given us the fisheye earlier they were just the specific for the bruised egos of our new friends the boys jumped up and down and howled and banged their spears against their shields they hurled taunts they pranced along the stonemarked boundary oneeye trotted after them the fish were not biting but they had a little bait of their own something got said the two warriors howled and attacked that caught everyone off guard three outsiders went down the others subdued our guides quickly though not without further mishap wheezer poised on the boundary wringing his hands and carping at oneeye while crows circled high above goblin i snapped oneeye get with it oneeye cackled reached up grabbed his hair and yanked he peeled himself from under that silly hat and the fanged and fiery thing behind the peeling was ugly enough to turn a buzzards stomach which was all show all distraction while goblin got on with the meat of it goblin seemed to be surrounded by giant worms it took me a moment to realize all those squirms were lengths of rope i shrieked when i saw the state of our gear goblin howled with laughter as a hundred chunks of rope went slithering through grass and air to pester climb bind garrote wheezer pranced around in an absolute apoplectic fit stop stop youre destroying the whole concord oneeye ignored him he put the mask back over the horror while punishing goblin with ferocious looks he resented goblins ingenuity goblin was not finished having strangled everyone not already carved up or nominally friendly he had his ropes drag the corpses across the boundary no outside witnesses oneeye assured me blind to those damned crows he glared at goblin what might the little toad have been up to say what those ropes that was no spurofthemoment piece of work croaker it would take months to charm that much line i know who he had in mind too no bloody more nice polite longsuffering oneeye the gloves are off now im going to get my revenge before that little bastard catches me with my back turned preemptive vengeance there was a oneeye concept for you i told you hes up to something im not going to stand around and wait ask wheezer what to do about the bodies wheezer said bury them deep and do a prime job of camouflaging trouble lady said any way you look at it the animals are rested well outrun it i hope so i wish there was something in her voice that i could not decipher i did not get it till later nostalgia homesickness longing for something irrevocably lost goblin dubbed our new guides the geek and the freak despite my displeasure the names clung we crossed the savannah in fourteen days without mishap though wheezer and the guides panicked each time they heard distant drums the message they dreaded did not come till we had left the savannah for the mountainous desert bounding it on the south both guides immediately begged to be allowed to stay with the company an extra spear is an extra spear oneeye told me the drums said theyve been declared outlaws what they said about us you dont want to hear you decide to go back north again youd better think about another way to get there four days later we made camp on some heights overlooking a large city and a broad river that flowed southeast we had come to geaxle eight hundred miles below the equator the mouth of that river sixteen hundred miles farther south lay at the edge of the world on the map i had made at the temple of travellers repose the last place name marked with great uncertainty was troko tallio a ways upriver from the coast once camp was set to my satisfaction i went looking for lady i located her among some high rocks but instead of studying the view she was staring into a tin teacup for an instant the cup appeared to contain a pinprick spark then she sensed my approach she looked up smiled there was no spark in the cup when i looked again must have been my imagination the company is growing she said youve accumulated twenty men since leaving the tower uhm i sat down stared at the city geaxle where the black company was in service but where wasnt the company in service i chuckled youre right were wading around in our own past we put the present dynasty in power down there when we left it was without the usual hard feelings what would happen if we rode in with murgen showing our true colors theres only one way to find out lets try it our gazes met and locked the multiple meaning sparked between us it had been a long time since that lost moment we had been evading moments like this a sort of delayed adolescent shyness and guilt the sun settled in a glorious conflagration the only fire there was that evening i just could not get past who she used to be she was angry with me but she hid it well and joined me in watching the city put on its night face that was a cosmetic job worthy of an aging princess she did not need to waste energy getting mad at me i was doing a fine job being mad at myself strange stars strange skies i observed the constellations are completely out of whack now much more and ill start feeling like im in the wrong world she made a snorting sound more than i do already hell id better rummage the annals to see what they say about geaxle i dont know why but the place bothers me which was true though id only just realized it that was unusual people intimidate me not places why dont you do that i could almost hear her thinking go hide in your books and your yesterdays ill sit here staring today and tomorrow in the eye it was one of those times when no matter what you say it will be the wrong thing so i did the second worst thing and went away without saying anything at all i almost tripped over goblin going back to camp though i was making a racket stumbling through the dark he was so intent he did not hear me he was peeping over a rock eyeballing the slump of oneeyes back he was so obviously up to no good i could not resist i bent and whispered boo he let put a squawk and jumped about ten feet stood there giving me the evil eye i tramped on into camp and started digging for the book i wanted to read why dont you mind your own business croaker oneeye demanded what mind your own business i was laying for the little toad if you hadnt stuck your nose in id have had him strung up like an antelope ready for gutting a rope slithered out of the darkness and curled up in his lap i wont let it happen again the annals did nothing to relieve my apprehension i got really paranoid getting that nervous itch between the shoulder blades i began studying the darkness trying to see who was watching both goblin and oneeye had a big sullen on i asked can you guys come up for a little serious business well yes they could but they could not admit that their pouting was not of earthshaking significance so they just stared at me and waited for me to get on with it ive got a bad feeling not exactly a premonition but the same family and it keeps getting worse they stared stonefaced refusing comment but murgen volunteered i know what you mean croaker ive had the heebiejeebies since we got here i gave the rest a scan they stopped yakking the tonk games came to a halt otto and hagop had small nods to admit that they felt unsettled too the rest were too macho to admit anything so maybe my collywobbles were not imaginary i get a feeling going down there could become a watershed of company history can one of you geniuses tell me why goblin and oneeye looked at each other neither spoke the only thing the annals say thats weird is that geaxle was one of those rare places the company walked away from what does that mean that murgen was a natural shill it means our forebrethren didnt have to fight their way out they could have renewed their commission but the captain heard about a treasure mountain up north where the silver nuggets were supposed to weigh a pound there was more to the tale but they did not want to hear it we were not really the black company anymore just rootless men from nowhere headed the same direction how much was that my fault how much the fault of bitter circumstance no comment they both looked thoughtful though so murgen break out the real colors tomorrow with all the honors that jacked up some eyebrows finish the tea guys and tell your bellies to get ready for some real brew they make the genuine elixir down there that sparked some interest you see the annals are good for something after all i set about doing some writing in the latest of my own volumes occasionally peeking at one or another of the wizards they had forgotten their feud were using their heads for something more than the creation of mischief during one of my upward glances i caught a silvery yellow flash it seemed to come from the rocks where i had been a while back watching the city lights lady i barked my shins a dozen times getting there then felt like a fool when i found her seated on a rock arms around her legs chin on her knees contemplating the night the light of a newly risen moon fell upon her from behind she was astonished by my wild stumble to the rescue what happened i demanded what i saw some weird flashes up here her expression in that light seemed honestly baffled must have been a trick of the moonlight better turn in pretty soon i want to get an early start all right she said in a small troubled voice is something wrong no im just lost i knew what she meant without her having to explain going back i ran into goblin and oneeye moving up carefully fireflies of magic danced in their hands and dread smoldered in their eyes chapter sixteen willows war willow was amazed it actually went pretty much the way it was supposed to the taglians gave up their territories below the main without a finger raised to resist the army of the shadowmasters came over the river and still met no resistance it dissolved into its four elements still meeting no opposition those forces broke up into companies the better to plunder the looting was so good all discipline collapsed taglian marauders began picking off foragers and small raiding parties suddenly everywhere the invaders suffered a thousand casualties before they understood cordy mather engineered that phase claiming to emulate his military idols the black company when the invaders responded with larger foraging parties he countered by leading them into traps and ambushes at his peak he twice suckered entire companies into densely built and specially prepared towns that he burned down around them the third time he tried that though the invaders did not take the bait his overconfident taglians got whipped wounded he went back to taglios to contemplate the fickleness of fate willow meantime was marching around the eastern taglian territories with smoke and twentyfive hundred volunteers keeping close to the enemy commander trying to look like a menace that would become nemesis the moment the invaders made a mistake smoke had no intention of fighting and was so stubborn even willow was tempted to grumble smoke claimed he was waiting for something to happen he wouldnt say what blade got stuck down south in the territories yielded without a fight along the main river he was supposed to get the locals together and keep any messengers from going back and forth it was an easy job there were no bridges across the river and only four places where it could be forded the shadowmasters must have been preoccupied their suspicions were not aroused or maybe they just assumed no news was good news what smoke was waiting for happened like blade said taglios was hagridden by its priests three major religions existed there not in harmony each had its splinters factions and subcults that feuded among themselves when they werent feuding with the others taglian culture centered upon religious differences and the efforts of the priests to get ahead of each other a lot of lowerclass people werent signed up with anybody especially out in the country likewise the ruling family who did not dare get religion if they wanted to stay in charge old smoke was waiting for one of the boss priests to get the idea he could make a name for himself and his tribe by getting out and busting the heads of the invaders nobody else would fight purely a cynical political maneuver smoke told willow the prahbrindrahs waited a long time to show someone what can happen if they dont do things his way he showed them one of the priests got the bright idea he conned about fifteen thousand guys into thinking they could handle experienced professionals heads up he led the mob out to look for the invaders they didnt have any trouble finding them the shadowmasters commander thought this was what he was waiting for too the shadowmasters other conquests had all been settled by one big brawl willow and smoke and a few others stood on top of a hill where both sides could see them and spent an afternoon watching two thousand men massacre fifteen thousand the taglians that got away did so mostly because the invaders were too tired to chase them now well fight smoke said so willow moved his force up and poked till the invaders got aggravated and came after him he ran till they stopped then he poked again and ran again and so forth he got the notion from a poorly remembered version of a time when the black company ran for a thousand miles and led their enemies into a trap where they died almost to a man thinking they had it won almost to the end maybe these guys heard the same story anyway they didnt want to be led first time they balked they just camped and wouldnt move so willow talked it over with smoke and smoke rounded up some volunteers from the countryside and started building a wall around the invaders next time the invaders just turned and marched off toward taglios which is what they should have done at the start instead of trying to get rich so willow jumped on them from behind and kept making a nuisance of himself till he convinced the enemy commander that he had to be gotten rid of or there just wouldnt be any rest he told smoke i dont know squat about strategy or tactics or anything but i figure i only got to work on one guy really the head guy over there i get him to do what i want he brings everybody else with him and i know how to aggravate a guy till hell fight me which is what he did the shadowmasters general finally chased him into a town that had been getting ready all along it was a bigger version of cordys game only this time there wasnt going to be a fire all the people had been got out and about twelve thousand volunteers put in their place while willow and smoke were running the invaders around those guys were building a wall willow ran into the town and thumbed his nose he did everything he could to get the enemy chief mad the man did not get mad fast though he surrounded the town then got every man he had in taglian territory that could still walk then he attacked it was a nasty brawl the invaders had it bad because in the tight streets they could not take advantage of better discipline they always had guys shooting arrows at them off the rooftops they always had guys with spears jumping out of doors and alleys but they were better soldiers they killed a lot of taglians before they realized they were in a box with about six times as many taglians after them as they expected by then it was too late for them to get out but they took a lot of taglians with them when it was over willow went back to taglios blade came home too and they opened the tavern back up and celebrated for a couple weeks meantime the shadowmasters figured out what happened and got thoroughly pissed they made all kinds of threats the prince the prahbrindrah drah basically thumbed his nose and told them to put it where the sun dont shine willow cordy and blade got a month off then it was time for the next part which was to take a long trip north with the radisha drah and smoke willow didnt figure this part was going to be a lot of fun but nobody could figure a better way to work it chapter seventeen geaxle i got them all up and decked out in their second best murgen had the standard out there was a nice breeze to stretch it those great black horses stamped and champed eager to get on down the road their passion communicated itself to their lesser cousins the gear was packed and loaded there was no reason to hold movement except that rattling conviction that the event would be something more than a ride into a city you in a dramatic mood croaker goblin asked feel like showing off i did and he knew it i wanted to spit defiance in the face of my premonition what have you got in mind instead of answering directly he told oneeye when we get down there and come over that saddleback where they can get their first good look at us you do a couple of thunders and a trumpet of doom ill do a riding through the fire that ought to let them know the black company is back in town i glanced at lady she seemed partly amused partly patronizing for a moment oneeye looked like he wanted to squabble he swallowed it and nodded curtly lets do it if were going to do it croaker move out i ordered i did not know what they had in mind but they could get flashy when they wanted they took the point together murgen a dozen yards behind with the standard the rest fell into the usual file with me and lady side by side leading our share of pack animals i recall eyeing the gleaming bare backs or the geek and the freak and reflecting that we had us some real infantry now the beginning of it was tight twists and turns on a steep narrow path but after a mile the way widened till it was almost a road we passed several cottages evidently belonging to herdsmen not nearly as poor and primitive as one would suspect up we went into the backside of the saddle goblin mentioned and the show started it was almost exactly what he prescribed oneeye clapped his hands a couple of times and the results were skyshaking crashes then he set them to his cheeks and let fly a trumpet call just as loud meantime goblin did something that filled the saddleback with a dense black smoke that turned into ferociouslooking but harmless flames we rode through i fought down a temptation to order a gallop and tell the wizards to have the horses breathe fire and kick up lightnings i wanted a showy announcement of the companys return but not the appearance of a declaration of war that ought to impress somebody i said looking back at the men riding out of the flames the ordinary horses prancing and shying if it doesnt scare hell out of them you should be more careful how much you give away croaker i feel daring and incautious this morning which was maybe the wrong thing to say after my failure of daring and lack of incaution the night before but she let it pass theyre talking about us up there she indicated the pair of stocky watchtowers flanking the road three hundred yards ahead there was no way to avoid riding between them through a narrow passage filled with the shadow of death up top heliographs chatted tower to tower and presumably with the city as well hope theyre saying something nice like hurray the boys are back in town we were close enough so i could make out the men up there they did not look like guys getting ready for a fight a couple sat on the merlons with their legs dangling outside one that i took to be an officer stood in a crenel with one foot up on a merlon leaning on his knee watching casually about the way id do it if i had me a really sneaky trap set i grumped not everyone in the world has the serpentine sort of mind you do croaker oh yeah im plain simple compared to some i could name she gave me one of her sharp oldtime ladyonfire withering looks oneeye was not there to say it himself so i said it for him that snakes probably got more smarts than you do croaker the only trouble he goes hunting is breakfast we were close to the one tower now with goblin and oneeye and murgen already past i raised my hat in a friendly salute the officer reached down beside him picked up something tossed it down it came tumbling toward me i snatched it out of the air what an athlete maybe ill go for two out of three i looked at what i caught it was a black stick about an inch and a quarter in diameter and fifteen inches long carved from some heavy wood decorated all over with ugly whatisits ill be damned no doubt what is it an officers baton ive never seen one before but theyre mentioned all through the annals up through the fall of sham which was some sort of mysterious lost city up on the plateau we just crossed i lifted the baton in a second salute to the man above the company was there its where it ended up after it left geaxle the captain didnt find his silver mountain he did find sham the annals are pretty confused the people of sham are supposed to have been a lost race of whites it seems that about three days after the company found sham so did the ancestors of the geek and the freak they got themselves worked up into some kind of religious frenzy and jumped all over the city the first horde to get there killed damned near everybody including most of the company officers before the company finished killing them the guys who survived headed north because there was another mob closing in from the south keeping them from heading back this way these batons arent mentioned after that to which her only response was they knew you were coming croaker yeah it was a mystery i do not like mysteries but it was only one of a herd and the bellies of most of them would never come floating up where i could give them the eyeball there were two guys waiting down the road from the watchtowers a third of a mile from the city wall the surrounding countryside was pretty barren for so close to a city i guess the ground was poor farther north and south there was plenty of green one of the two guys gave goblin an old company standard there was no doubt what it was though i did not recognize any of the honors it was damned ragged as you would expect of something as old as it had to be what the hell was going on here oneeye tried talking to those guys but it was like starting a conversation with a stone they faced their mounts around and got out front i gave oneeye a nod when he looked back to see if we should follow a twelveman honor guard presented arms as we passed through the gate but nobody else greeted us silence ran with us as we moved through the streets people stopping to stare at the palefaced strangers lady got half the attention she deserved it she looked damned good very damned good black and tight both became her she had the body to pull it off our guides led us to a barracks and stable the barracks part had been maintained but not used for a long time it seemed we were supposed to make ourselves at home all right our guides did a fade while we were checking the place out well goblin said bring on the dancing girls there were no dancing girls there was not a lot of anything else either unless you count apparent indifference i had everybody stick tight the rest of the day but nothing happened we had been shelved and forgotten next morning i turned loose our two most recent recruits along with oneeye and wheezer on a mission meant to find a barge that would take us down the river you just sent the fox to get a new latch for the chicken coop goblin protested you shouldve sent me along to keep him honest otto busted out laughing i grinned but kept the rest inside you arent brown enough to get by out there little buddy oh horse hockey you bothered to look outside since we got here theres white folks around fearless leader hagop said hes right croaker aint a lot of them but i seen a few where the hell did they come from i muttered going to the door sparkle and candles got out of my way they were there to ambush any surprise unwanted guests i went outside and leaned against the whitewashed wall chewed a piece of horse sorrel i plucked from the edge of the street yeah the boys were right there were a pair of whites an old man and a twentyfivish woman skulking down the way they made a production of being indifferent to me while everyone else gawked goblin get your tail out here he stumped outside sulky yeah take a discreet look down there you see an old man and a younger woman white yes i see them so what ever seen them before at my age everybody looks like somebody ive seen before but weve never been in this part of the world so maybe they look like somebody we seen somewhere else she does anyway hunh other way around for me something about the way he moves rings alarms goblin plucked his own horse sorrel i watched when i looked back the odd couple were gone headed our way were three black guys who looked like trouble on the hoof gods i didnt know they made them that big goblin muttered stared past them he wore a puzzled frown he cocked his head like he was having trouble hearing the three big guys marched up stopped one started talking i did not understand a word no spikee pal try another lingo he did i did not get any of that either he shrugged and checked his buddies one of them tried a clicky tongue you lose again guys the biggest broke into a ferocious dance of frustration his buddies gabbled and goblin wandered away on me without a faretheewell croaker i caught a glimpse of his back as he scooted into a passage between buildings meantime my new friends decided i was deaf or stupid they yelled at me slowly which brought sparkle and candles outside followed by the others the three big guys cussed each other some more and decided to go away what was that all about hagop asked you got me goblin came trooping back wearing a big smug frog grin im amazed i said i figured i was going to lose a week while i hunted down the local hoosegow and sold my soul to dig you out he put on a show of being hurt he squeaked i thought i saw your girlfriend sneaking off i just went to check judging by your smugness you did see her sure did and i saw her meet up with your old man and his fluff yeah lets go inside and give it a think i checked around in there just to make sure goblin was not seeing things lady was gone sure enough what the hell oneeye and his crew came strutting in late that afternoon oneeye smirked like a cat with feathers in his whiskers geek and freak lugged a big closed basket between them wheezer hacked and chewed and smiled like there was big mischief afoot and he maybe had a big hand in it goblin jumped up from a nap with a squawk of protest before oneeye got started you get right on back out that door with that whateveritis buzzard breath before i turn that spiders nest you call a brain into toys for tumblebugs oneeye did not give him a look check this out croaker you aint going to believe what i found the boys set the basket down and popped the lid i probably wont i agreed i snuck up on that basket expecting a gross of cobras or something such what i saw was a pintsized ringer for goblin better say demitassesized since goblin is not much more than a halfpint himself what the hell is it whered it come from oneeye stared at goblin i been asking myself that for years he had the biggest gottcha grin i ever saw goblin howled like a leopardess in heat started making mystical passes his fingers raked furrows of fire out of the air even i ignored him what is it its an imp croaker an honesttogod imp dont you know an imp when you see one no whered it come from i was not sure i wanted to know knowing oneeye heading down to the river we come on this little bunch of shops around an outdoor bazaar where they got all kinds of neat stuff for wizards fortunetellers spirit talkers ouija workers and such and right there in the window of this dinky holeinthewall shop just begging for a new home was this little guy i couldnt resist say hello to the captain frogface the imp piped hello to the captain frogface it giggled just like goblin in a higher voice jump on out of there bitty buddy oneeye said the imp popped into the air as if shot up oneeye chortled he caught it by a foot and stood there with it dangling head down like a toddler with a doll he eyeballed goblin who was positively apoplectic so fussed he could not go on with the magical funny business he had started oneeye dropped the imp it flipped and landed on its feet sped across and stared up at goblin like a young bastard having a sudden epiphany about the identity of its sire it did cartwheels back to oneeye said im going to like it here with you guys i snagged oneeye by the collar and lifted him off the floor what about the damned boat i shook him a little i sent you out to hire a goddamned boat not to buy talking knickknacks it was one of those flashes of rage that last about three seconds rare for me but usually strong enough to let me make an ass of myself my father had them a lot when i was little i would hide under the table for the minute or so they took to pass i set oneeye down looking amazed he told me i found one all right pulls out day after tomorrow at first light i couldnt get an exclusive charter because we couldnt afford anything big enough to haul us and the animals and coaches if that was all the barge would be carrying i ended up making a deal the imp frogface was behind wheezer clinging to and peeking around his leg like a frightened child though i got the feeling it was laughing at us all right i apologize for blowing up tell me about the deal this is only good to what they call the third cataract understand thats a place eight hundred sixty miles down that a boat cant get past theres about an eightmile portage then you have to hire passage again to the second cataract no doubt sure anyway we can get the long first leg free with food and fodder provided if we serve as guards on this commercial barge ah guards what do they need guards for and why so many pirates i see meaning wed end up fighting even if we did pay for our passage probably did you get a good look at the boat is it defensible yeah we could turn it into a floating fort in a couple days its the biggest damned barge i ever seen a tinkle of alarm began nagging in the back of my thoughts well give it another look in the morning all of us the deal sounds too good to be true which probably means it is i figured that was one of the reasons i bought frogface i can send him sneaking around to check things out he grinned and glanced at goblin who had gone into a corner to plot and pout also with frogface along we dont have to waste no coin on guides and interpreters he can do all that for us that sent my eyebrows up really thats right see i do do something useful once in a while youre threatening to you say the imp is ready to use as ready as he can be come on outside where its private i got about ten jobs for it chapter eighteen the barge i took the outfit to the waterfront before the sun got its rump over the hills beyond the river the city remained somnolent except for traffic headed the way we were the nearer the river the worse it got and the waterfront was a frenzied hive there were crows looks like theyve been at it all night i said which one is it oneeye that big one over there i headed the direction he pointed the barge was a monster all right it was a giant wooden shoe of a thing meant mainly to drift with the current travel would be slow on a fat sluggish river like this it looks new we moved in an island of silence and stares i tried to read the faces of the laborers we passed i saw little but a slight wariness i noted a few armed men as big as my visitors of yesterday boarding some of the lesser barges i eyed the stevedores marching aboard our craft why the lumber do you suppose my idea oneeye said its to build mantlets the only protection from missile fire they had was wicker screens im surprised they listened and went to the bother and expense maybe they took me up on all my suggestions were set if they did im not surprised i was now sure that not only had our arrival been foreseen it had been calculated into the schemes of an entire city that pirate infestation was more than a nuisance these folks meant to hammer it down using a band of expendable adventurers i did not understand why they thought they had to run a game on us that was our trade and we had to go down that river anyway maybe it was the way the society worked maybe they could not believe the truth with frogfaces help it took about six minutes to straighten out the bargemaster and the committee of bigwigs waiting with him i wrangled the promise of a huge fee on top of our passage we go to work as soon as we see the money i told them lo it appeared almost magically oneeye told me you could have held them up theyre desperate i agreed must be something they have to get through lets get to work dont you want to know what it doesnt matter were going anyway maybe but ill have frogface look around whatever i toured the main deck otto and hagop tagged along we talked upgraded defensibility we need a better idea of what were up against we want to be prepared for pirate tactics for example we might set up engines behind the mantlets if they attack from small boats i paused along the wharf side rail it was obvious a convoy would follow our barge which as obviously had been constructed to lead the way never would they get it back upriver it had only enough oars to keep it pointed the right direction there were crows over the chaos i ignored them i had begun to suspect i was obsessed then i spied an island of emptiness against a warehouse wall people avoided it without noting what they were doing a vague shape stood in shadow crows fluttered up and down i felt like someone was staring at me was it my imagination no one else saw the damned crows time i found out what the hell is going on oneeye i need to borrow your new pet i told frogface to go over and take a gander he went and in a minute he was back giving me a funny look what was i supposed to see captain what did you see nothing i looked over there nothing was what i saw now but then i spotted the three big guys who had tried to talk to me yesterday they had a bunch of cousins with them getting in the way they were watching our barge i presumed they were interested in us still got a translating job for you runt the biggest guys name was mogaba him and his buddies wanted to sign on with the company he said there were more at home like them if i would have them then he claimed a right he told me that all the big men i saw wandering around with sharp steel were descendants of the black company men who had served geaxle in olden times they were the nar the military caste of the city i got the impression that to them i was something holy the real captain a demigod what do you think i asked oneeye we could use guys like them look at them monsters take all you can get if theyre for real can frogface find out you bet he instructed the imp sent him scooting croaker i jumped i had not heard oneeye coming what those nar are the real thing tell him frogface the imp piped away in that high goblin voice the nar were indeed descendants of our forebrethren they did form a separate caste a warrior cult built around the myths the company left behind they kept their own set of annals and observed the ancient traditions better than we did then frogface hit me with the kicker somebody called eldon the seer a famous local wizard foretold our coming months ago about the time we were crossing those shaggybacked hills headed for dloc aloc the nar had initiated a series of contests and trials to select the best man of each hundred to rejoin the father standard and make the pilgrimage to khatovar if we would have them eldon the seer had deciphered our mission from afar too i do not like it when things are going on that i do not understand understand mogaba was chosen commander of the delegation by virtue of being the champion of the caste while the nar prepared for a holy hadj the lords and merchants of geaxle began setting up to use us to break through a pirate blockade that had become impenetrable in recent years the great hope from the north that was us i dont know what to say i told oneeye ill tell you one thing croaker you arent going to be able to tell those nar guys no i did not have that inclination these pirates about whom nobody would say much sounded increasingly nasty somewhere down the line without it having been stated explicitly i had come on the notion that they had big magic they could call out when the going got hairy why not those guys are serious croaker religious serious theyd do something crazy like throw themselves on their swords because the captain found them inadequate to march with the company come on really i mean it its a religious thing with them youre always telling about old ways when the standard was a tutelary deity and whatnot theyve gone the other direction from what we did the company that went north turned into your basic gang of cutthroats the kids they left behind turned them into gods thats scary better believe theyre going to be disappointed in us im the only one left who takes the traditions seriously horseapples croaker spit and polish and beating the drum for the olden days aint all there is to it i got to go find that little geek goblin and see if he can stop pouting long enough for us to do a layout on how we work this scow if it gets hit hell the pirates know everything thats going on up here maybe our reputation will scare them into letting us slide through think so it sounded like a nice idea no frogface get over here acts like a damned kid getting into things frogface i want you to stick with croaker you do what he tells you just like if he was me got it you dont and ill paddle your butt for all its talents the imp had the mind of a fiveyearold with an attention span to match it told oneeye it would behave and help me but i did not expect that to be easy i went down to the wharf and accepted thirtytwo recruits into our brotherhood of arms mogaba was so pleased i thought he might hug me they were a damned impressive thirtytwo men every one a monster and quick and lithe as a cat if they were the mongrel children of the men who had served in geaxle what must those oldtimers have been like first thing after i swore them in mogaba asked if it was all right if his caste brothers did guard duty aboard the other boats so they could tell their sons that they had followed the hadj as far as the third cataract sure why not mogaba and his boys had my head spinning for the first time since i got stiffed with the job i really felt like i was the captain the gang dispersed to get their gear and to spread the good news i noted the master of the barge watching from up forward he was wearing a big pooeating grin things were going just dandy for his crowd they thought they had us by the short hairs and broken to the bridle hey croaker here comes your prodigal girlfriend you too pup i ought to toss you in the river if i could run the imp down he had the energy of a fiveyearold too i spotted her by the commotion she caused or the lack of it where she passed men paused to look and sigh and shake their heads wistfully it did not occur to them to whistle catcall or make crude remarks i looked around and picked a victim murgen murgen ambled over what do you need when lady gets here show her her quarters the attached room is for her guests i thought dont think just do i made myself scarce i was not yet ready for the inevitable battle chapter nineteen the river night on the river a moon splattering the dark mirror of water a stillness at times almost supernatural then the cacophony of a festival in hell crocodiles grunting fifty kinds of frogs singing birds hooting and squawking hippos snorting the gods only knew what all and bugs buzzing the bugs were almost as bad as they had been in the jungle they would get worse once we entered the wetlands farther south the river was said to flow imperceptibly through a swamp ten to eighty miles wide and three hundred miles long here the west bank was still tame the east was threequarters wild the people we saw watching from boats in the mouths of sloughs and creeks were as poorly tamed as their land i was assured that they living in the shadow of the city were harmless when they came whooping out it was to hawk crocodile hides and parrotfeather cloaks on impulse i bought one of the cloaks the biggest and most outrageously colorful one available it must have weighed sixty pounds wearing it i became the very image of a savage chieftain mogaba examined the cloak and pronounced it a wise buy he told me it would shed darts and arrows better than armor of steel some of the nar bought croc hides to toughen their shields goblin got a wild hair and bought him a couple of preserved croc heads one was so big it looked like it had been lopped off a dragon while i was seated up top contemplating the nighttime river wondering about crows he was up forward mounting his monster purchase as a figurehead i supposed he had some drama up his sleeve he came to me with the smaller head i want to fit you out to wear this you what i want to fit you out to wear this so when the pirates come you can strut around up here in your feather coat breathing fire like some mythological beast thats a great gimmick i really like it in fact i love it why dont we see if we cant get some dope like big bucket to try it but you dont think im going to stand up there and let people snipe at me do you youll have plenty of protection from me and oneeye yeah then my prayers are answered at last for years ive wanted nothing more than protection from you and oneeye preserve me o sainted fathers of the company ive cried a thousand times yea ten thousand times have i called sputtering he cut me off and changed the subject he squeaked those people your girlfriend brought aboard next fool who calls lady my girlfriend gets to throw a saddle on a croc and see if they can be broken you get my drift yeah you got your feelings hurt on account of reality is catching up with you i kept my mouth shut but just barely bad news those two are croaker he whispered in the nobreath whisper we use when we are creeping past enemy sentries theres big mojo brewing down in their cabin he was trying to make himself useful he had been overshadowed since the appearance of frogface so i did not tell him i was on to that already and had had me a thought or two about what could be done a fish jumped up and skipped across the water to get away from some predator for his effort he got his reward some night bird snagged him on the bounce i grunted should i let goblin know how much i knew and suspected or should i just go on looking dumb while setting the moment up building a mystique had become important now that the company was on the grow it should work for a while the old hands should not suspect me of taking as cynical and pragmatic an approach to command as i planned i listened to goblins outpouring of fact suspicion and speculation little that he said was new what was new only more thoroughly framed the picture i had i told him i think its time you came up with the masterpiece of your life goblin something plain direct and powerful that you can cut loose in a second he turned on the famous goblin grin im way ahead of you croaker ive got a couple of things in the works that are going to amaze people when i use them good i had a feeling oneeye was in for a shock somewhere down the line the journey to the third cataract takes a minimum two weeks because the current does not exceed a slow walk adding pirate trouble could make the trip last forever by the end of our fourth day the barge was as defensible as possible timber shields protected the main deck their lower ends projected over the water to make boarding from boats difficult none of the embrasures in that shielding were big enough for a man to weasel through the guys had put together four ballistae for each side thanks to oneeyes foresight we had the makings for firebombs by the score and ready bombs in wellprotected nests atop the deckhouse the three brothers from beryl built us a dolphin which is a fishshaped weight attached to a long chain it is swung out on a boom and dropped through the bottoms of boats my favorite engine though was thought up by patience a former caravan guard a springboard would slap the base of a cartridge filled with poisonous darts throwing a hail of missiles the poison needed only the tiniest cut to cause quick paralysis the engines one shortcoming was that it was immobile you had to wait for your target to cross your aim once construction was finished i treated everyone to a rich diet of my own pet peeves from my days as a follower instead of chieftain drills and exercises and intense language study i kept oneeye and his pet in a sweat trying to establish at least one common tongue among the men there was plenty of grumbling only the nar were impressed favorably lady did not appear she might not have existed for all we could tell we entered the wetlands mostly cypress swamp early the sixth morning everyone became more alert there was no sign of pirates for another two days when they did come we had plenty of warning from oneeye and goblin we were passing through a place where the cypress crowded the channel the attackers in twenty boats came at us headon around a bend i could bring only two ballistae to bear those stopped just one boat arrows from those of us atop the deckhouse which ran most of the length and width of the barge did no good the boats had canopies of crocodile hide they rushed in alongside grapnels on chains not easily cut caught on the top of the shielding pirates began clambering up i had them where i wanted them the shields were perforated with small holes mogabas nar stabbed through those at legs the few pirates reaching the top had to balance on a fourinch width of timber before leaping to the deckhouse roof it was a turkey shoot none survived to make the jump goblin and oneeye did not lift a sorcerous finger they amused themselves throwing firebombs the pirates had not encountered those before they fled sooner than they would have had the boys not gotten into the game my guess is the pirates lost fifty to sixty men not a small hurt but smaller than it could have been and the good merchants of geaxle hoped we would break the pirates the bargemaster appeared out of nowhere like a ghost as the pirates hauled ass neither he nor his crew had been visible during the skirmish we had been drifting free at the whim of the river frogface appeared coincidentally i used him to give the man nine kinds of hell my rage took the edge off the complaining he did about us letting so many pirates get away youll have to fight them again now next time theyll know what to expect the way i heard the first attack is just a probe what the hell is going on out there the river had begun to foam with underwater excitement something began thumping against the barges hull needleteeth the bargemaster shuddered even frogface seemed unsettled a fish as long as your arm heads for blood in the water when theres a lot they go mad and attack everything they can devour a hippo bones and all in a minute is that so the river grew wilder the dead pirates and the wounded who had not gotten aboard boats and away vanished broken and burning boats and driftwood went down piscine gullets at least the needleteeth gave it the heroic try once i was convinced the crew would participate in wreaking their own salvation next time i went and had me a powwow with my tame wizards the second attack came at night this time those guys were serious their earlier asskicking had them feeling noprisoners mean we had plenty of warning of course goblin and oneeye were on the job it was in another narrow place and this time they had a boom across to catch and hold us i screwed them up by having anchors dropped when goblin detected the boom we stopped two hundred yards above the heart of the trap we waited goblin oneeye you guys set we had our surprises ready mom cletus you on the dolphin yes sir we had not used that before otto i dont hear that goddamned pump what the hell is going on back there im looking for the crew guys now croaker all right they wanted to chicken out again eh hoped they could buy off the pirates by not resisting murgen dig that barge boss out of his hiding hole i knew where he was i want him up here oneeye i need your pet soon as he gets back from scouting frogface showed first he was telling me that every adult male in the swamp was out there when murgen brought the bargemaster to me whimpering in a hammerlock as the first pirate arrows fell i said tell him he goes over the side if his people arent on the job in two minutes and that ill keep throwing guys out till i get what i want i meant what i said the message got through i heard the pumps begin squeaking and clinking when murgen and i were getting set to see how far we could throw a man the arrow fall picked up it was illdirected and did no harm but its only purpose was to keep our heads down there was a big outbreak of cussing and caterwauling yonder when goblin tested a favorite gimmick from his white rose days a spell that started every insect in a small area noshing on the nearest human flesh the whoop and holler died quickly test fulfilled question answered they had somebody capable of undoing trivial witcheries oneeye was supposed to sneak along to spot the guy responsible if one turned up so he and goblin could gang up and nail his hide to the nearest cypress the arrow fall stopped and speak of the devil here came oneeye big trouble croaker that guy over there is a heavyweight i dont know what we can do about him do what you can blindside him did you notice the arrows stopped there was a lot of carrying on in the swamp to cover the sounds of oars right oneeye ran to his place a point of pink light soared upward i donned the crocodile head goblin had fixed it was time for the show half of winning a battle is showmanship the pink point grew up fast and shed light on the river there must have been forty boats sneaking toward us they had extended their crochide protection in hopes of shedding firebombs i was glowing and breathing fire bet i made a hell of a sight from over there the nearest boats were ten feet away i saw the ladder boxes and grinned behind my croc teeth i had guessed right i threw my hands up then down a single firebomb arced out to shatter upon a boat stop pumping you goddamned idiots i yelled the bomb was a dud i did my act again second time had the charm fire splattered in seconds the river was aflame except for a narrow strip around the barge the trap was almost too good the fire sucked most of the air away and heated what was left till it was almost unbearable but the burning did not last long thanks to the lack of enthusiasm of the oil pumpers fewer than half the attack wave succumbed but the survivors had no stomach left for combat especially after the dolphin and ballistae started knocking their boats apart they headed for cover slowly painfully the ballistae and dart throwers left their sting a big big howl went up over there it took them a while to get the anger worked out a rattle clank and slap of oars against water announced a second wave i was laying for these guys too it was the third wave that would be the bitch if they did not get it out of their systems right away the third wave and that unknown quantity that oneeye had discovered were what worried me the pirate boats were a hundred feet from the barge when goblin gave me the high sign he had the needleteeth gathering in baffled thousands the lead boats got close enough i went into my dance the dolphin went down shattering a large wooden swamp boat every engine cut loose fire bombs and javelins flew the idea was to get some wounded pirates into the water with the needleteeth some got the river went mad half the pirate boats were hides stretched on wooden frames those did not last at all wooden boats fared better but only the heaviest withstood repeated strikes and even they were at the mercy of the panic of the men aboard the smartest and quickest pirates charged the barge if they could get aboard and take control but that was the chance i wanted them to see they had come prepared with ladders that had planks fixed to their backs thrown up on our mantlets and nailed into place the ladder backing would protect pirate arms and legs from the stabbing nar except that i had had the nar driving spikes and sharpened wooden slats through the cracks between the mantlet timbers those made it hard to put the ladders up cletus and his brothers smashed several boats before the pirates discovered what wonderful hand and foot holds the spikes made the nar had instructions to leave them alone as long as they did nothing but hang there their presence would discourage sniping by their brothers and fathers and cousins it took a while but silence came to the night and stillness to the river the wreckage drifted off to pile up against the boom my men sat down to rest oneeye pulled his pink lights out of the sky he goblin frogface my squad leaders mogaba and lo the barges master joined me for a powwow the latter suggested we up anchor and roll how long have we been here i asked two hours goblin said well let it rest a while the convoy was supposed to have fallen back till it was an estimated eight hours behind the theory being that if they overtook us because we were in action they would arrive with the pirates in a state of exhaustion and would be able to overcome them if we had been wiped out oneeye whats the situation with the sorcerer over there he did not sound well when he replied we could be in big trouble croaker hes even more potent than we guessed at first you tried getting him twice i dont think he even noticed if hes that bad whys he laying off instead of stomping us we dont know should we take the initiative should we bait him and try to draw him out murgen asked why dont we just break the boom and go we got enough of them to keep the swamp in mourning for a year they wont let us thats why they cant oneeye can you find that wizard yeah why should i i agree with the kid break the boom they might surprise us theyd surprise us all right what the hell do you think the boom is there for dummy why do you think i stopped us up here can you put one of your little pink balls in his hair if i have to for maybe half a minute you have to when i tell you i had been trying to find unusual parameters to the situation and thought i had one i was set for an interesting if potentially fatal experiment hagop you and otto get all the ballistae around to the east side take forty percent of the tension off them so they can throw firebombs without breaking them in the trough with frogfaces help i told mogaba i wanted his archers on the deckhouse roof when oneeye spots our target i want half highangle plunging fire half flat trajectory and i want firebombs flying like were trying to burn the swamp down a pirate let out a cry of despair as he lost his grip and fell from the shielding a riot in the water told us the needleteeth knew a good thing and had hung around lets get at it goblin hung on till the others had gone i think i know what youre trying to do croaker i hope you dont regret it you hope i blow it and were all dead i gave the command oneeyes rangefinder squirted across the water the moment it blossomed everyone cut loose for a minute i thought we had the sucker suddenly lady materialized on the deckhouse roof i removed my crocodile head heck of a show there eh cypress and moss will burn liberally primed what do you think youre doing you finally deign to report for duty soldier her left cheek twitched my tactic had not been deployed against the pirate sorcerer at all an arrow burred between us not six inches from either of our noses lady jumped then the pirates clinging to the shielding finally tried coming on up and over to the deckhouse roof the half dozen not swept away by the archers just threw themselves into a hedgehog of spears set to receive them i think ive fixed it so theres only one way they can take us i gave her a moment to think they have a sorcerer whos a heavy hitter so far hes laid low ive just told him i know hes there and im going to get him if i can you dont know what youre doing croaker wrong i know exactly what im doing she spat an epithet of disbelief stamped away frogface i called he materialized better put that croc hat back on chief the spell wont keep the arrows off if you dont one whimpered past as he spoke i grabbed the head you do the job on her stuff all taken care of chief i rolled it over into a place that isnt this place youll hear them howling in a minute the fires among the cypress winked out like snuffed candles several of oneeyes pink fireflies sailed across and simply vanished the night began to fill with an oppressive and dreadful sense of presence the only light left flickered around me and around the mouth of the croc head mounted on the bow lady came at a run croaker what did you do i told you i knew what i was doing but all gone all your little toys from the tower call it intuition love reaching a conclusion from inadequate and scattered information though i think it helped being familiar with the people im playing with the darkness grew deeper the stars vanished but the night had a gleam on like a polished piece of coal you could see glimmers though there was no light at all not even from the figurehead youre going to get us killed that possibility has existed since i was elected captain it existed when we left the barrowland it existed when we walked away from the tower it existed when we sailed from opal it existed when you swore your oath to the black company it became highly probable when i accepted this hasty and misrepresented commission from the merchants of geaxle nothing new there friend something like a large flat black stone came skipping across the water throwing up sprays of silver goblin and oneeye scuttled it what do you want croaker her voice was taut maybe even edged with fear i want to know who runs the black company i want to know who makes the decisions about who travels with us and who doesnt i want to know who gives members of the company permission to wander off for days at a time and who gives out the right to hide out for a week shirking all duties most of all i want to know who decides which adventures and intrigues will involve the company the skipping stones kept coming leaving their sprays and ripples of silver each came nearer the barge whos going to run things lady you or me whose game are we going to play yours or mine if not mine all your treasures stay where you cant get at them and we go to the needleteeth now youre not bluffing are you you dont bluff when youre sitting across the table from somebody like you you bet everything youve got and wait to see if youre called she knew me she had had her looks inside me she knew i could do it if i had to she said youve changed gone hard to be the captain you have to be the captain not the annalist or the company physician though the romantic is still alive back in there somewhere you might have pulled it off if youd gone through with it that night on that hill one of the skipping stones nudged the barge i said you had me going for a while you idiot that night didnt have anything to do with this back then i didnt think there was a chance this would work that was a woman on that hill with a man she cared about and wanted croaker and she thought that was a man who the next stone whammd home the barge shuddered goblin yelled croaker are we going to make a move i asked or should i shuck down so i can try to outswim the needleteeth damn you you win your promise good this time for them too yes damnit i took a chance frogface roll it over bring the stuff back a stone hit the barge timbers groaned i staggered and goblin yelled again i said your stuff is back lady get shifter and his girlfriend up here you knew i told you i figured it out move the old man called eldron the seer appeared but now he wore his true guise he was the supposedly slain taken called shapeshifter half as tall as a house and half as wide a monster of a man in scarlet wild stringy hair whipped around his head his jungle of a beard was matted and filthy he leaned upon a glowing staff that was an elongated improbably thin female body perfect in its detail it had been among ladys things and had been the final clue that had convinced me when frogface reported its presence he pointed that staff across the river a hundredfoot splash of oily fire boiled up amidst the cypress the barge reeled at the kiss of another flat stone timbers flew below the horses shrieked in panic some of the crew sang with them my companions looked grim in the light of the fires shapeshifter kept laying down splash after splash till the swamp was immersed in a holocaust that beggared both of mine put together the screams of the pirates became lost in the roar of the flames i won my bet and shifter kept laying it down a great howling rose within the fire it faded into the distance goblin looked at me i looked at him two of them in ten days i muttered we had heard that howling last during the battle at charm and not friends anymore lady what would i have found if i had opened those graves i dont know croaker anymore i dont i never expected to see the howler again thats for sure she sounded like a frightened troubled child i believed her a shadow passed the light a nightflying crow what next shifters companion saw it too her eyes were tight and intense i took ladys hand i liked her a lot better now that she had her vulnerability back chapter twenty willow up the creek willow scowled at the boat im so thrilled i could shit whats wrong cordy asked i dont like boats why dont you walk me and blade will cheer you on whenever we see you puffing along the riverbank if i had your sense of humor id kill myself and save the world the pain cordy hell we got to do it lets do it he headed out the wharf you seen the woman and her pup smoke was around earlier i think theyre on already low profile on the sneak they dont want anybody knowing the radisha is leaving town what about us blade grinned going to cry because the girls didnt come down to drag him back going to cry a lot blade cordy said old willow cant go anywhere without bitching to keep his feet moving the boat wasnt that bad it was sixty feet long and comfortable for its cargo which consisted only of the five passengers willow got in his gripe about that too as soon as he discovered that the radisha hadnt brought a platoon of servants i was sort of counting on having somebody take care of me getting soft man blade said next thing you be wanting to hire somebody to fight in your place when you get trouble sounds good to me we done enough of that for somebody else havent we cordy some the crew poled the boat into the current which was almost nonexistent that far down the river they upped a linen sail and swung the bow north there was a good breeze they gained on the current about as fast as a man moving at a lazy stroll not fast but no one was in a big hurry i dont see why we got to start now willow said we aint going where she wants i bet you the rivers still blockaded above the third cataract there wont be no way we can get past thresh thats far enough to suit me anyway thought you was going to keep on hiking cordy said he remembered they laying for him in geaxle blade said moneylenders got no sense of humor it took two weeks to reach catorce below the first cataract they hardly saw smoke or the radisha the whole time they got damned tired of the crew as humorless a bunch of river rats as ever lived all of them fathers and sons and brothers and uncles of each other so nobody ever dared loosen up the radisha would not let them put in at night she figured somebody would shoot his mouth off and the whole world would find out who was on the river without benefit of armed guards that hurt willows feelings from a couple different directions the first cataract was an obstacle to navigation only to traffic coming up the river the current was too swift for sail or oars and the banks too far and boggy for a towpath the radisha had them leave the boat at catorce with the crew to wait there for their return and they made the eighteenmile journey to dadiz above the cataract on foot willow looked out at river barges coming down riding the current and griped blade and cordy just grinned at him the radisha hired another boat for the passage to the second cataract she and smoke stopped trying to stay out of sight she figured they were too far from taglios for anybody to recognize them the first cataract was four hundred eighty miles north of taglios half a day out of dadiz willow joined cordy and blade in the bows he said you guys notice some little brown guys back in town kind of watching us cordy nodded blade grunted an affirmative willow said i was afraid it was my imagination maybe ill wish it was i didnt recognize the type you guys cordy shook his head blade said no you guys dont break a jaw chinning how would they know to be watching us willow whoever they are only one who knows where were headed is the prahbrindrah drah and even he dont know why willow started to say something decided he should shut his mouth and think after a minute he grunted the shadowmasters they might know somehow yeah they might you think they might give us some trouble what would you do if you was them right i better go nag on smoke smoke could be the hole card smoke claimed the shadowmasters didnt know about him or if they did they had no good estimate of his competence smoke and the radisha had made themselves comfortable in the shade of the sail and were watching the river go by the river was something worth seeing willow would admit even here it was half a mile wide smoke old buddy we maybe got us a problem the wizard stopped chewing on something he had had in his mouth all morning he peered at willow with narrowed eyes willows style was getting to him back in dadiz there was these little brown guys about so high skinny and wrinkly that was watching us i asked cordy and blade they seen them too smoke looked at the woman she looked at willow not someone you made an enemy of coming south willow laughed hey i dont have no enemies no theres nobody like these guys anywhere between roses and taglios i never saw anybody like them before i figure that means its not me theyre interested in she looked at smoke did you notice anyone no but i wasnt watching it seemed unnecessary hey smoke you always watch willow said this heres your basic unfriendly old world you better always be on the lookout when youre travelling theres bad guys out here believe it or not not everybodys as polite as you taglians swan returned to the bow that dolt wizard never even noticed the brownies the guys got lard for brains blade took out a knife and whetstone and went to work better sharpen up edge might dull down before the old boy wakes up and sees were under attack it was a threehundredmile passage to the second cataract where the river scampered nervously between dark and brooding hills as though too wary to stay in one place long on the right bank the haunted ruins of chon delor stared down on the flood reminding willow of a heap of old skulls no traffic had passed along the right bank since the fall of the paingod even animals shunned the area on the hilltops beyond the left bank were the ruins of the triplet cities odd the first odd the second and odd the third stories cordy had heard coming south said they had sacrificed themselves to bring the paingod down now people lived only along a narrow strip beside the cataract in a walled city one street wide and ten miles long perpetually nervous about ghosts from the wars that were they called their bizarre city idon and had the weirdest bunch of quirks anyone ever saw travellers stayed in idon only as long as absolutely necessary likewise many of the people of idon themselves passing through keeping his eyes open while pretending to be gawking at the weirdos willow noticed little brown guys skulking everywhere hey smoke you eagleeyed bastard you see them now what he dont blade said better sharpen me a couple more knives pay attention old man theyre all over like roaches actually willow had seen only eight or nine but that was plenty enough especially if they had the shadowmasters behind them they had somebody behind them they made that clear soon after the radisha found a boat for the trip to thresh and the third cataract they got around a bend in the river where it flowed through country that looked like it was left over from the war between the triplet cities and chon delor and here came two fast boats loaded down with little brown guys rowing like the winner of the race got to become immortal the crew the radisha had hired took maybe twenty seconds to decide it wasnt their squabble they dived overboard and headed for the bank you see them now smoke willow asked starting to ready his weapons i hope youre half the wizard you think you are there were at least twenty brown men in each boat smokes jaw went high speed as he chomped whatever he chewed all the time he did nothing till the boats began creeping up to either side then he stuck out both hands toward one closed his eyes and wriggled his fingers all the nails and pegs holding the boat together flew around like swarming swallows pattered into the water brown men hollered and gurgled it didnt look like many of them knew how to swim smoke took a moment to catch his breath then turned on the other boat the brown men there were turning already heading for shore smoke took that boat apart too then he gave willow one dark look and went back to his seat in the shadow of the sail he smirked forever afterward whenever he heard willow bitching about having to work ship at least we know hes the real thing now willow grumbled to himself the situation in thresh was exactly what willow had predicted the river was closed to the north pirates the radisha could find no one willing to hazard the long run north to geaxle which is where she was determined to go to wait nothing she offered would get anybody to risk the journey not even her companions whom she urged to steal a boat she was furious you would have thought the hinges of the world would lock up if she didnt get to geaxle she did not get for months they hung around thresh staying out of the way of little brown guys hearing rumors that the merchants of geaxle had gotten desperate enough to try doing something about the river pirates thresh was a snakes nest of gloom without trade upriver it would wither any hope that the northerners would break through seemed absurd everyone who tried died one morning smoke came to breakfast looking thoughtful i had a dream he announced oh wonderful willow snapped i been sitting around here for months now just praying youd have another one of your nightmares what do we do this time storm the shadowlands smoke ignored him he had been doing that a lot communicating through the radisha it was the only way he could deal with swan without getting violent he told the woman theyve departed geaxle a whole convoy can they break through smoke shrugged theres a power as mighty and cruel as the shadowmasters in the swamps maybe greater than the shadowmasters i havent been able to find it in my dreams willow muttered i hope the brownies arent smoking something too they figure were going to connect up they might get more ambitious they dont know why were here swan i poked around i found out that much they just want you and me and cordy would have done it to us in taglios if they caught us there comes to the same thing how long before that convoy gets here the radisha said smoke how long the wizard responded with all the steely certitude of his breed he shrugged the lead boat was spotted by somebody fishing upriver the news reached thresh a few hours before the barge willow and his group went down to the piers with half the city to wait for it people howled and cheered until those aboard began disembarking then a deep dread silence fell the radisha grabbed smokes shoulder in a grip obviously painful these are your saviors old man im about out of patience with you chapter twentyone thresh we broke the boom we headed for the trading city thresh which lies above the third cataract it was a quiet river going down there might have been no other human beings in the world outside of us on the barge but the wreckage that kept pace was a screaming reminder that we were not alone that we belonged to a bleak and bloodyminded species i was not fit company for man or beast as they say oneeye joined me where i stood under the battered croc head goblin had mounted in the bows be there in a little bit croaker i dipped into my trick bag of repartee and countered with an unenthusiastic grunt me and the runt been trying to get a feel for the place up ahead i cracked him up with another grunt that was his job dont got a good feel to it we watched another small fishing boat hoist anchor and raise sail and skitter south with the news of our coming not a real danger feel not an allbad feel just not a right feel like theres something going on he sounded puzzled around the edges you figure its something that might concern us send your pet to find out what thats what you bought him for isnt it he smirked the current in a lazy turn of the river held us close to the right bank two solemn crows watched our progress from a lone dead tree gnarled and ugly the tree made me think of nooses and hanged men now why didnt i think of that croaker here i just sent him into town to check on the quiff situation teach your grandmother to suck eggs croaker the imp came back with a disturbing report there were people in thresh waiting for us specifically us the black company how the hell did everybody know we were coming the waterfront was mobbed when we warped in though nobody really believed we had come from geaxle i guess they figured we spontaneously generated on the river up around the bend i kept everyone aboard and mostly out of sight till the rest of the convoy arrived it came through untouched its guards and crews were simmering with stories of the devastation they had found in our wake rejoicing spread through thresh the blockade had been strangling the city i watched the good citizens from behind a mantlet here and there i noted hardeyed little brown men who seemed less than enchanted with our advent those the guys you were talking about i asked oneeye he gave them the fisheye then shook his head ours should be over that way there they are weird i saw what he meant a man with long blond hair what the hell was he doing down here keep an eye on them i collected mogaba and goblin and a couple of the guys who looked like they ate babies for breakfast and went into conference with the bosses of the convoy they surprised me they not only did not argue about paying the balance of our fee they tossed in a bonus on account of every barge got through then i got my key people together and told them lets get offloaded and hit the road this place gives me the creeps goblin and oneeye complained naturally they wanted to stay and party they came around when the iron coach and the great black horses and the company standard hit the wharfside road the joy went out of the grand celebration almost immediately id figured it would blank faces watched the unforgotten standard pass thresh had been on the other side when the company was in service in goes our forebrethren had kicked their butts good so good they recalled the company this long after the fact though goes itself no longer existed we paused in an open market toward the south edge of thresh mogaba had a couple of his lieutenants dicker for supplies goblin went stomping around in a squeaking rage because oneeye had set frogface to following him aping his every word and move the imp was trudging behind him at the moment looking deep in thought otto and hagop and candles were trying to thrash out the details of a pool that would pay off big to the guy who guessed closest to when goblin would come up with a definitive counterstroke the trouble was a definition of what could be considered definitive oneeye observed proceedings with a benign smug smile certain he had attained ascendancy at last the nar stood around looking grimly military and still a little baffled because the rest of us had less rigid absolute standards they had not been disappointed in us on the river oneeye ambled over them people are giving us the eye again got them all picked out now four men and a woman round them up and bring them over well see whats on their minds wheres wheezer oneeye pointed then did a fade as i approached wheezer i noted that a dozen of my men had disappeared oneeye wasnt going to take any chances i told wheezer to tell mogaba we werent stocking up for a sixmonth campaign we just wanted enough stuff for a meal or two getting past the cataract we yakked it back and forth mogaba struggling with the jewel cities dialect he had begun to pick up already he was a sharp smart man i liked him he was flexible enough to understand that our two versions of the company could have arisen easily over two hundred years he worked at being nonjudgmental so did i hey croaker here you go here came oneeye grinning like a possum bringing in his catch the three younger men two of whom were whites seemed baffled the woman looked angry the old man looked like he was daydreaming i eyeballed the white men again wondering how the hell they had gotten here they got anything to say for themselves mogaba drifted over he looked at the black man thoughtfully about then the woman had plenty to say the darker haired white man wilted slightly but the other just grinned i said lets check them on languages between us weve got most of them they speak up north frogface popped up try them out on rosean chief i got a hunch then he rattled something at the old man the guy jumped about a foot off the ground frogface chortled the old man stared like he was seeing a ghost before i could ask what verbal stunt hed pulled the blond man asked you the captain of this outfit he spoke rosean i understood him but my rosean was rusty i hadnt used it in a long time yeah you got any other languages you use he had he tried a couple his forsberger was not good but my rosean was worse he asked what the hell happened to you guys he regretted saying it immediately i looked at oneeye he shrugged i asked what do you mean uh coming down the river you done the impossible aint nobody gotten through in a couple years me and cordy and blade we were about the last ones just lucky he frowned he had heard the stories spread by the boatmen mogaba said something to one of his lieutenants they looked the black man blade over good the geek and the freak who had confessed to being brothers and having the real names clawofthelion and heartofthelion also moved in to look him over he wasnt pleased i asked heart is there something special about that guy maybe captain maybe tell you later right back to forsberger youve been watching us we want to know why he had an answer all ready my buddies and me we been hired to take the broad and the old boy down the river we was kind of hoping we could hook on with you guys as far as taglios for the extra protection you know what i mean he looked at murgen and the standard i seen that somewhere before roses who are you how stupid did i look maybe i needed to check a mirror oh yeah sorry im swan willow swan he stuck out a hand i didnt take it this heres my buddy cordy mather cordwood dont ask even he dont know why and thiss blade we been doing what you might call freelancing up and down the river taking advantage of being exotic you know how it is you guys been about everywhere he was rattled you couldnt have tortured it out of him maybe but he was scared half to death he kept looking at the standard and the coach and the horses and the nar and shuddering he was a lot of things maybe that he was not going to admit a liar was the biggest i thought it might be interesting even entertaining to have him and his bunch along so i gave him what he wanted all right tag along as long as you pull your weight and remember whos in charge he broke out in smiles great you got it chief he started chattering at his pals the old man said something sharp that shut him up i asked frogface he give anything away there nah he just said i did it chief and went to bragging on his golden tongue swan where the hell is this taglios i dont have a taglios on my maps let me see half an hour later i knew his taglios was a place my best map named troko tallios trogo taglios swan told me theres this monster city taglios that surrounds an older one that was called trogo the official name is trogo taglios but nobody ever calls it anything but taglios anymore its a nice place youll like it i hope so oneeye said hes going to try to sell you something croaker i grinned well have some fun with him while he tries watch them be friendly with them find out whatever you can wheres lady gotten off to now i was too fussed she wasnt far off she was standing aside inspecting our new acquisitions from another angle i beckoned her what do you think i asked when she joined me swans eyes popped when he got a good look at her he was in love not much watch the woman shes in charge and shes used to getting her own way arent you all cynic thats me to the bone and youre the one made me that way love she gave me a funny look forced a smile i wondered if wed ever recover that moment on that hillside so many miles to the north we were just coming back to the river after having walked past the third cataract when willow joined me as i walked my horse he eyed the big black nervously and got around where i would be between it and him he asked are you guys really the black company the one and only the evil mean rude crude nasty and sometimes even unpleasant black company you never spent any time in the military did you as little as i could man last i heard there was a thousand of you guys what happened times got hard up north a year ago we were down to seven men how long ago did you leave the empire way back me and cordy bugged out of roses maybe a year after you guys were in there after that rebel general raker i wasnt much more than a kid we sort of drifted from one thing to another headed south first thing you know we was across the sea of torments then we got into some trouble with the imperials so we had to get out of the empire then we just kept drifting a little bit this year a little bit that we hooked up with blade next thing you know here we are down here whatre you guys doing here going home that was all i needed to tell him he knew plenty about us if he had come to us knowing taglios was on our itinerary but not our final destination i said in a military outfit its not acceptable behavior for just anybody to walk up and start shooting the shit with the commander any time they feel like it i try to keep this outfit looking military it intimidates the yokels yeah gotcha channels and all that right he went away his taglios was a long way off i figured we had time to sort his bunch out so why press chapter twentytwo taglios we returned to the river and sailed down to the second cataract faster traffic had carried the word that the boys were back idon a bizarre strip of a town was a ghost city we saw not a dozen souls there once again we had come to a place where the black company was remembered that made me uncomfortable what had our forebrethren done down here the annals went on about the pastel wars but did not recall the sort of excesses that would terrify the descendants of the survivors forever below idon while we waited to find a bargemaster with guts enough to take us south i had murgen plant the standard mogaba as serious as ever got a ditch dug and our encampment lightly fortified i swiped a boat and crossed the river and climbed the hills to the ruins of chon delor i spent a day roaming that haunted memorial to a dead god alone except for crows always wondering about the sort of men who had gone before me i suspected and feared that they had been men very much like me men caught in the rhythm and motion and pace unable to wriggle free the annalist who recorded the epic struggle that took place while the company was in service to the paingod had written a lot of words sometimes going into too great a detail about daily minutiae but he had had very little to say about the men with whom he had served most had left their mark only when he recorded their passing i have been accused of the same it has been said that too often when i bother to mention someone in particular it is only as a name of the slain and maybe theres truth in that or maybe thats getting it backward there is always pain in writing about those who have perished before me even when i mention them only in passing these are my brethren my family now almost my children these annals are their memorial and my catharsis but even as a child i was a master at damping and concealing my emotions but i was speaking of ruins the spoor of battle the pastel wars must have been a struggle as bitter as that we had endured in the north confined to a smaller territory the scars were still grim they might take a thousand years to heal twice during that outing i thought i glimpsed the mobile stump i had seen from the wall of the temple of travellers repose i tried getting closer for a better look but it always disappeared on me it was never more than a glimpse from the corner of my eye anyway maybe i was imagining it i did not get to explore as thoroughly as i wanted i was tempted to hang around but the old animal down inside told me i did not want to be stranded in those ruins after dark it told me wicked things stalked chon delors night i listened i went back over the river mogaba met me at the shore he wanted to know what i had found he was as interested in the companys past as i was i liked and respected the big black man more with every hour that evening i formalized his hitherto de facto status as commander of the company infantry and i resolved to take murgens annalist training more seriously maybe it was just a hunch whatever i decided that it was time i got the companys internal workings whipped into order all these natives lately were afraid of us they carried old grudges maybe farther down the river there was somebody with less fear and a bigger grudge we were on the brink of lands where the companys adventures were recalled in the early lost volumes of the annals the earliest extant picked up our tale in cities north of trogo taglios cities that no longer exist i wished there was some way i could dig details of the past out of the locals but they were not talking to us while i moped around chon delor oneeye found a southern bargemaster willing to carry us all the way to trogo taglios the mans fee was exorbitant but willow swan assured me i was unlikely to get a better offer we were haunted by our historical legacy i got no help from swan or his companions unearthing that my notion for unmasking swan and his gang gradually made very little headway the woman forced them to stay to themselves which did not please cordy mather he was hungry for news from the empire i did find out that the old man was called smoke but never got a hint of the womans name even with frogface on the job they were cautious people meantime they watched us so closely i felt they were taking notes whenever i bellied up to the rail to increase the flow in the river other concerns plagued me too crows always crows and lady who hardly spoke these days she pulled her turns at duty with the rest of the company but stayed out of the way otherwise shifter and his girlfriend were not to be seen they had disappeared while we unloaded at thresh though i held the disturbing certainty that they were still around close enough to be watching what with the crows and all our arrivals anticipated i had the feeling i was being watched all the time it was not hard to get a little paranoid we rode the rapids of the first cataract and swept on down the great river into the dawn of company history my maps called it troko tallios locally they called it trogo taglios though those who lived there used the shorter taglios mostly as swan said the trogo part refers to an older city that has been enveloped by the younger more energetic taglios it was the biggest city i had ever seen a vast sprawl without a protective wall still growing rapidly horizontally instead of vertically northern cities grow upward because no one wants to build outside the wall taglios lay on the southeast bank of the great river actually inland a little straddling a tributary that snakes between a halfdozen low hills we debarked in a place that was really a satellite of the greater city a riverport town called maheranga soon maheranga would share the fate of trogo trogo retained its identity only because it was the seat of the lords of the greater principiate its governmental and religious center the taglian people seemed friendly peaceable and overly godridden much as swan and mather had described in brief exchanges during our journey but underneath that they seemed to be frightened and swan had told us nothing about that and it was not the company that was their terror they treated us with respect and courtesy swan and party vanished as soon as we tied up i did not have to tell oneeye to keep an eye on them the maps showed the sea only forty miles from taglios but that was along a straight line to the nearest coast west across the river down the rivers meander and delta it was two hundred miles to salt water on the map the delta looked like a manyfingered spidery hand clawing at the belly of the sea it is useful to know a little about taglios because the company ended up spending a lot more time there than any of us planned maybe even more than the taglians themselves hoped once i was convinced we would be secure doing so i ordered a break at taglios the rest was overdue and i needed to do some heavy research we were near the edge of the maps in my possession i discovered that i had come to count on swan and mather to show me around without them i was forced to rely on oneeyes pet devil and that i did not like for no reason i could finger i did not entirely trust the imp maybe it was because his sense of humor so closely reflected his owners the only time you trusted oneeye was when your life was at stake i hoped we were now far enough south that i could chart the rest of our course to khatovar before we resumed travelling lady had been the perfect soldier since the encounter on the river though not much of a companion otherwise she was shaken badly by the howlers return and enmity he had been a staunch supporter in the old days she was still caught in the purgatory zone between the old lady and the new that had to be and the heart was not bound in the same direction as the head she could not find her way out and much as i ached for her i did not know how to take her hand and show her i figured she deserved a distraction i had frogface shop for a local equivalent of opals gardens and he astonished me by finding one i asked lady if she would be interested in a real social evening out she was amenable if not excited after so many months of neglect not thrilled just i dont have anything better to do so why not she never was the social sort and both my maneuver on the river and my evasions through attention to duty had not left her pleased with me we did it decked out with drama though without as much uproar as we had raised in opal i did not want the local lords taking offense oneeye and goblin behaved frogface was the only clear evidence of sorcery none of that nastiness we had shown in opal frogface went along in his capacity as universal translator oneeye decked his pet out in a costume as flamboyant as his own one that mocked goblins dress subtly it seemed to state that this was how nice goblin could look if he would get over being a slob taglioss elite went to see and be seen in an olive grove past its prime bearing years the grove bestrode a hill near old trogo a hot spring fed a score of private baths it cost a bundle to get in when you were not known most of that in bribes even so it was two days after i asked before room could be found for us we went in the coach with goblin and oneeye up top and squads of four nar each marching before and behind murgen drove he took the coach away after he delivered us the others accompanied us into the grove i wore my legates costume lady was dressed for the kill but in black all the time with the black it looked good on her but times were i wished she would try another color she said our presence has stirred more interest than you expected our advent had caused very little stir in the streets of taglios she was right unless the grove was a major in place to spend an evening a lot of class folks had come out just to give us the eye it looked like everyone who might be anyone was there wonder why theres something going on here croaker i am not blind i knew i knew after a few minutes with willow swan way back upriver but i could not find out what even frogface was no help if they did any scheming they did it when he was not around except for the nar who had lived with ceremony in geaxle we were all uncomfortable under the pressure of so many eyes i admitted this might not have been one of my brighter ideas on the contrary it confirms our suspicions that theres a greater interest in us than should be for simple travellers they mean to use us she was disturbed welcome to life in the black company sweetheart i said now you know why im cynical about lords and such now you know one of the feelings ive been trying to get across maybe i get it a little i feel demeaned like im not human at all but an object that might be useful like i said welcome to the black company that was not all her problem i barken back to the rogue taken howler the dead unexpectedly alive and inimical no amount of tall talking would convince me his appearance on the river was chance he had been there to do us hurt moreover there had been an odd and unusual interest in us at least since opal i looked for crows there were crows in the olive trees quiet and still watching always watching shapeshifters presence in geaxle the dead again living waiting for lady there were hidden schemes brewing too much had happened to let me believe otherwise i had not pressed her yet she was being a good soldier maybe waiting for what i had learned long ago that i can find out more around her sort by watching and listening and thinking than i ever do by asking they lie and mislead even when there is no need more except in her own case i did not think she had any better idea what was stirring than i did the grove staff showed us to a private bower with its own hot mineral bath the nar spread out goblin and oneeye found themselves inconspicuous posts frogface stayed close to interpret we settled how is your research coming lady asked she toyed with some plump purple grapes strangely is the only way to describe it i think were right up next to the place where you come to the end of the earth and fall off the edge what oh your sense of humor taglios is infested with chartmakers they do good work but i cant find one map that will get me where i want to go maybe you havent been able to make them understand what you need it wasnt that they understood thats the problem you tell them what you need and they go deaf new maps only run to the southern borders of taglian territory when you can find an old one it fades to blank eight hundred miles southeast of the city its the same even with maps so good they show damned near every tree and cottage theyre hiding something a whole city dont seem likely but it does look like theres no other explanation you asked the appropriate questions with the silvertongued cunning of a snake when the blank space comes up translation problems develop what will you do dusk had come lamplighters were at work i watched a moment maybe use frogface somehow im not sure were far enough back that the annals are almost useless but the indicators are that we head straight for that blank space you have any thoughts about it me you things are happening around the company i dont think thats because i strut so pretty phooey i havent pressed lady for all theres reason and i wont unless i have to but it would be nice to know why weve got one dead taken hanging around watching us out of the bushes and another one that used to be your buddy trying to kill us back in those swamps might be interesting to know if he knew you were aboard that barge or if he was working on a grudge against shifter or if he just wanted to keep traffic from moving down the river might be interesting to know if were likely to run into him again or somebody else who didnt die on time i tried to keep my tone gentle and neutral but some of my anger got through the first food arrived bits of iced melon soaked in brandy while we nibbled some thoughtful soul gave our guardians food as well less elegant fare perhaps but food nevertheless lady sucked a melon ball and looked thoughtful then her whole stance changed she shouted dont eat that stuff she used the tongue of the jewel cities which by now even the most thickwitted of the nar understood silence grabbed the grove the nar dropped their platters i rose what is it someone has tampered with their food poison drugged id guess id have to check more closely i went and got the nearests platter he looked grim behind his nar mask of indifference he wanted to hurt somebody he got his chance when i turned back with my plunder a quick shuffle of feet a thwack of wood against flesh a cry of pain that was little more than a whimper i turned the nar had his spearpoint resting on the throat of a man sprawled before him i recognized one of the lamplighters a long knife lay not far from his outflung hand i surveyed our surroundings bland faces watched from every direction oneeye frogface come here they came i want something lowkey something that wont disturb anybodys dinner but something that will have him in a mood to talk when im ready can do oneeye snickered i know just the thing he rubbed his hands in wicked glee while goblin left out pouted i know just the thing go enjoy your dinner and sweet nothings old oneeye will take care of everything ill have him ready to sing like a canary he gestured an invisible force snagged the lamplighters heels up he went wriggling like a fish on a line mouth stretched to scream but nothing coming out i settled opposite lady a jerk of my head oneeyes idea of lowkey dont let the victim scream i popped a melon ball into my mouth oneeye stopped lifting the lamplighter when his nose was twenty feet off the ground lady began poking through the nars food the expedient of turning my back on oneeye did not let me attain the mood id had in mind when arranging the evening and lady remained troubled i glanced over my shoulder occasionally the captive shed bits of clothing like dead leaves peeling away the flesh beneath betrayed crawled with tiny lime and lemon glowing worms when two of different hues butted heads they sparked and the failed assassin tried to shriek when the mood took him oneeye let the man fall till his nose was a foot off the ground frogface whispered into his ear till oneeye hoisted him up again real lowkey what the hell would he have done if id asked for a show goblin caught my eye i raised an eyebrow he used deaf sign to tell me company coming looks like big stuff i pretended no greater interest than my meal while watching lady intently she seemed possessed of no special awareness there were two of them well dressed and courteous one was a native walnut brown but not of negroid stock the people of taglios were dark but not negroid the negroid peoples we had seen there were all visitors from up the river the other one we knew already willow swan with the hair as yellow as maize swan spoke to the nar nearest him while his companion appraised oneeyes efforts i nodded to goblin who went to see if he could get any sense from swan he came back looking thoughtful swan says the guy with him is the boss wog around here his choice of words not mine i guess it was bound to come i exchanged glances with lady she had on her empresss face readable as a rock i wanted to shake her to hug her to do something to free up the passion that had appeared so briefly before going underground she shrugged i said invite them to join us and tell oneeye to send the imp over i want him to check on swans translations the serving staff got down on their faces as our guests approached it was the first time i had seen that kind of behavior in taglios swans prince was the real thing swan got right to it this heres the prahbrindrah drah the head guy around here and you work for him he smiled in a lefthand sort of way drafted he wants to know if youre looking for a commission you know were not i told him but he wanted to check it out personal were on a quest i thought that sounded dramatic enough a mission from the gods a what these taglians are superstitious you ought to know that by now that would be the way to get the quest idea across mission from the gods sure you couldnt stick around for a while take a break from the road i know how rough it is travelling and travelling and my man needs somebody to do his dirty work you guys got a rep for handling that stuff what do you really know about us swan he shrugged stories stories hunh the prahbrindrah drah said something he wants to know why that guy is hanging up in the air because he tried to stab me in the back after somebody tried to poison my guards after a while im going to ask him why swan and the prahbrindrah chattered the prahbrindrah looked irked he glanced at oneeyes pet chattered some more he wants to know about your quest you heard it all coming down the river you told him already man hes trying to be polite i shrugged how come so much interest in a few people just passing through swan started looking nervous we were starting to move in toward it the prahbrindrah said several sentences swan said the prahbrindrah says youve talked about where youve been and he would like to hear more about your adventures because far peoples and places intrigue him and your quest but you havent really said where youre going he sounded like he was trying to translate very accurately frogface gave me a shallow nod we had told swans bunch little during the passage south from the third cataract we had hidden from them as much as they from us i decided to pronounce the name maybe better kept to myself khatovar willow did not bother translating the prahbrindrah chattered he says you shouldnt do that too late to stop swan then you got troubles you cant even imagine captain swan translated the prince replied he got excited boss says its your neck and you can shave with an axe if you want but no sane man says that name death could strike you down before you finished he shrugged and smirked as he spoke though its likely more mundane forces will slaughter you if you insist on chasing that chimera theres bad territory between here and there swan looked at the prince and rolled his eyes we hear tales of monsters and sorcery hey really i plucked a morsel from a small bird chewed swallowed swan i brought this outfit here all the way from the barrowland you remember the barrowland monsters and sorcery seven thousand miles i never lost a man you remember the river folks who got in my way didnt live to be sorry listen close im trying to say a couple of things here im eight hundred miles from the edge of the map i wont stop now i cant it was one of the longest speeches ive ever made outside reading to the men from the annals your problem is those eight hundred miles cap the other seven thousand were a stroll in the country the prahbrindrah said something short swan nodded but did not translate i looked at frogface he told me glittering stone what thats what he said chief glittering stone i dont know what he meant swan its a local expression the walking dead is the closest way to say it in rosean it has something to do with old times and something called the free companies of khatovar which was bad medicine back when i raised an eyebrow the black company is the last of the free companies of khatovar swan he gave me a sharp look then he translated the prince chattered back he stared at oneeyes victim as he did cap he says he supposes anything is possible but a returning company aint been spotted since his granddaddys granddaddy was a pup he wonders though says maybe youre real your coming was foretold quick glance at frogface with a scowl like the imp was a traitor and the shadowmasters have warned him against dealing with you though that would be the natural inclination considering the devastation and despair spread by the fanatics of old i glanced at frogface he nodded swan was striving for exactitude lady said hes playing games croaker he wants something tell him to get to the point that would be nice swan he continued translating but yesterdays terror means nothing today you are not those fanatics that was seen on the river and trogo taglios will bow the neck to no one if the pestilence in the south fears a band of freebooters he is willing to forget the ancient scores and tend to those of his own time if you too can forget i didnt have the foggiest what the hell he was talking about croaker lady snapped catching the scent of what was in the back of my mind almost before i did we dont have time for you to indulge your curiosity about the past theres something going on here tend to it before we get our butts in a sling she was turning into one of the guys for sure you getting the idea where we stand swan you dont really figure we think running into you and the woman up there was by chance do you talk me some plain talk some not so very plain talk took a while darkness came and the moon rose it climbed the sky the operators of the grove became exasperated but were too polite to ask their ruling prince to bug off and while we stayed so did the scores who had come out to look at us definitely something going on i whispered to lady but how do i dig it out of him the prahbrindrah played down everything he said but the presence of the city fathers shrieked that taglios was approaching a perilous crossroads an undercurrent in what i heard told me the prince wanted to spit in the face of calamity willow tried to explain a while back and nobodys sure exactly when because nobody was looking for it what you might call a darkness turned up in a place called pityus which is like four hundred miles southeast of taglios nobody worried about it then it spread to tragevec and kiaulune which are pretty important and six and fred and all of a sudden everybody was worried but it was too late you had this huge chunk of country ruled by these four sorcerers that refugees called shadowmasters they had a thing about shadows changed tragevecs name to shadowlight and kiaulune to shadowcatch and nowadays most everybody calls their empire the shadowlands youre going to get around to telling me what thiss got to do with us arent you within a year after the shadowmasters took over they had those cities which hadnt practiced war since the terror of khatovar armed and playing imperial games in the years since the shadowmasters have conquered most of the territories between taglioss southern frontiers and the edge of the map im starting to smell it croaker lady said she had grown grim as she listened i am too go on swan well before they got to us before they went to work on taglios they had some kind of falling out down there started feuding the refugees talk about the whole big show intrigues betrayals subversions assassinations alliances shifting all over whenever it looked like one of them was starting to get ahead the others would gang up was like that for fifteen eighteen years so taglios wasnt threatened but now they are now theyre all looking this way they made a move last year but it didnt work out for them he looked smug what they got here in this berg is all the guts anybody could ask and not a bat in broad daylights notion what the hell to do with them me and cordy and blade we kind of got drafted last year but i wasnt never much of a soldier and neither was they as generals were like tits on a boar hog so this isnt about bodyguarding and dirtytricking for your prince at all is it he wants to drag us into his fight did he think he could get us on the cheap or something didnt you make a report about our trip down here hes the kind of guy whos got to check things for himself maybe he figured to see if you rated yourself cheap i told him all the stories i ever heard about you guys he still wanted to see for himself hes a pretty good old boy first prince i ever seen that tries to do what a prince is supposed to do rarer than frog hair then im sure but you said it swan were on a mission from the gods we dont have time to mess in local disputes maybe when were on our way back swan laughed whats so funny you really dont got no choice no i tried to read him i couldnt lady shrugged when i looked at her well why not to get where you want to go you got to head right through the shadowlands seven eight hundred miles of them i dont think even you guys can make it neither does he you said they were four hundred miles away four hundred miles to pityus cap where it started they got everything from the border south now seven eight hundred to shadowcatch and like i said they started on us last year took everything south of the main i knew the main to be a broad river south of taglios a natural frontier and barrier swan continued their troops are only eighty miles from taglios some places and we know theyre planning a push as soon as the rivers go down and we dont figure theyre gonna be polite all four shadowmasters said they would get mean if the prahbrindrah had anything to do with you guys i looked at lady damned awful lot of folks know more about what im doing and where im going than i do she ignored me she asked why didnt he run us off swan why did he send you to meet us oh he never sent us he didnt know about that part till we got back he just figures if the shadowmasters are scared of you guys then he ought to be friends with you it wasnt me who frightened them but why give that away swan and his buddies and boss didnt need to know who lady had been hes got guts they all got guts out the yangyang pity is they dont know what to do with them and i cant show them like he says the shadowmasters would come sooner or later anyway so why appease them why let them pick their time whats in this for willow swan you come on pretty strong for a guy just passing through cordy aint here to hear me so ill tell it straight im not on the run no more ive found my place i dont want to lose it good enough maybe i couldnt give him an answer here now you know that if you know anything about the black company at all i dont think theres much chance it isnt what we want to do but ill give the situation a fair look tell him i want a week and the cooperation of his people i planned to spend another eleven days resting and refitting i was out nothing making that promise nothing but some of my share of the rest thats it swan asked what else is there you expect me to jump in just because youre a sweet guy swan im headed for khatovar ill do what i have to do to get there you made your pitch nows the time to back off and let the customer think he babbled to his prince the more the evening went on the more i was tempted to issue a flat rejection croaker was getting old and cranky and not thrilled with the idea of learning yet another language the prahbrindrah drah nodded to swan he agreed with me they rose i did likewise and gave the prince a shallow bow he and swan walked away pausing here and there to speak to other midnight diners no telling what he said maybe what they wanted to hear the faces i could see were smiling i got myself comfortable leaned back to watch oneeye at play he had a swarm of bugs zipping around his victims head i asked lady what do you think its not my place to think where would you be inclined to stand im a soldier of the black company as youre inclined to remind me so was raven so long as it suited his convenience dont play games with me talk to me straight do you know these shadowmasters are they taken you sent down here to start building you a new empire no i salvaged shifter and sent him south just in case when the fury of the war and stormbringers enmity were enough to explain his disappearance thats all but howler had his own escape planned knows of my condition and nurtures ambitions of his own obviously but the shadowmasters i know nothing nothing you shouldve asked more about them i will if theyre not taken they sound close enough as makes no difference so i want to know where do you stand im a soldier of the black company theyve already declared themselves my enemies thats not a definitive answer its the best youre going to get i figured what about shifter and his sidekick i hadnt seen them since thresh but had the feeling they were just around the corner if its as bad as it looks well need all the resources we can muster shifter will do what i tell him not the most reassuring answer but i did not press again it was the best i was going to get eat your dinner and stop pestering me croaker i looked down at food now so old it was no longer palatable smirking frogface ambled off to help his master soften the will of an assassin oneeye overdid it he has that way when he has an audience he gets too exuberant our prisoner expired from sheer terror we gained nothing from him but notoriety as though we needed that chapter twentythree willow bats and things it was late willow yawned as he tumbled into his chair blade cordy and the woman looked at him expectantly like the prahbrindrah couldnt talk for himself we talked and the radisha demanded you maybe expected him to jump up and down and yell oh goodie what did he say he said hed check it out which is about the best you could expect i should have gone myself the prahbrindrah said sister the man wouldnt have listened at all had not someone just tried to kill him she was astonished willow said those guys arent stupid they knew we was up to something way back when they let us hook up with them at the third cataract they been watching us as close as we been watching them smoke drifted in with all the racket of his namesake it was a big room in the cellar of a friend of the radisha near the olive grove it smelled moldy although it was open to the night in places smoke came a few steps into the light cast by three oil lamps his face puckered into a frown he looked around whats the matter cordy asked he shivered visibly swan got a creepy feeling too im not sure for a moment like something was staring at me the radisha exchanged looks with her brother then with willow willow those two odd little men oneeye and goblin fact or fraud six of one and half a dozen of the other right blade cordy cordy nodded blade said the little one like a child frogface thats dangerous what is it the woman asked the oddest child ive ever seen there were times when it acted a hundred years old maybe ten thousand smoke said an imp i dared not investigate lest it recognize me as more than a silly old man i dont know its capacities but definitely a supernatural entity of great efficacy my question is how an adept of a capacity as limited as the oneeye creature obtained control im superior to him in talent skill and training but i can neither summon nor control such a thing sudden squeaks and flutters came from the darkness startled everyone turned bats hurtled into the light peeping diving dodging a sudden larger shape flashed through dark as a chunk of night it ripped a bat on the fly another shape flung through a second later dropping another bat the others got away through a barred but otherwise unclosed groundlevel window what the hell willow squawked whats going on blade said couple of crows killing bats he sounded perfectly calm as if crows killing bats in a basement at midnight around his head was something that happened all the time the crows did not reappear i dont like it willow cordy said crows dont fly at night somethings going on everyone looked at everyone else and waited for somebody to say something nobody noticed the pantherine shadow settle outside the window one eye peeking inside nor did anybody realize that a childsized figure lounged atop an old crate beyond the light grinning but smoke began to shiver and turn in slow circles again with that feeling of being watched the prahbrindrah said i recall saying it wouldnt be a good idea to meet this close to the grove i recall suggesting we get together in the palace in a room that smoke has sealed against prying i dont know what just happened but it wasnt natural and i dont want to talk here lets go the delay cant hurt can it smoke the old man shuddered violently said it might be most wise my prince most wise there is more here than meets the eye henceforth we must assume we are under surveillance the radisha was irked by who old man i dont know does it matter radisha there are those who are interested the high priests these soldiers you wish to use the shadowmasters perhaps forces of which we are unaware they all looked at him explain that the woman ordered i cannot except to remind you that those men successfully fought their way through river pirates who have held the river closed for some time none of them would say much about it but a word here and a word there added together suggested that there was sorcery of the highest order involved on both sides and theirs was sufficient to force the blockade but except for the imp there was nothing of that sort evident when we joined them if they had it where did it go could it be that well hidden maybe but i doubt it maybe it travels with them without being with them if you see what i mean no youre up to your old tricks being deliberately vague im vague because i have no answers radisha only questions i wonder more and more if the band we see isnt an illusion cast for our benefit a handful of men hard and tough and skilled in their murderous ways to be sure but nothing that should terrify the shadowmasters there arent enough of them to make a difference so why are the shadowmasters concerned either they know more than we do or they see better than we do remember the history of the free companies they werent just bands of killers and these men are determined to reach khatovar their captain has tried everything short of violence to unearth information about the way hey smoke you said go someplace else and talk blade said so how about we go swan agreed yeah this dump gives me the creeps i dont get you guys radisha you and the prince claim you run taglios but you go around hiding out in holes like this our seats arent secure she started moving we rule with the consent of the priests really and we dont want them knowing everything were doing every damned lord and priest who was anybody was up in that grove tonight they know they know what we told them which is only part of the truth cordy eased in close to willow keep it down man cant you see whats up theyre playing for a lot more than just turning back the shadowmasters uhm behind them something resembling a panther padded from one pool of darkness to another silent as death itself crows glided from one point of vantage to another a childlike figure tagged along behind apparently openly but remaining unseen but no bats darted overhead willow understood with that one admonition the woman and her brother thought the struggle with the shadowmasters would preoccupy the priests and cults while they were distracted they would gather all the reins of the state he did not begrudge them he had little use for priests he thought maybe blade was on to something here sure they ought all to be drowned so taglios could be put out of its misery each dozen or so paces he turned looked back the street was always empty behind him yet he was sure something was watching creepy he muttered and wondered how hed gotten himself into this mess chapter twentyfour taglios a princely pressure that prahbrindrah drah might have been one of the good guys but he was as slick as any villian two days after our visit i couldnt go out without being hailed guardian protector and deliverer what the hell is going on i asked oneeye trying to lock you in he glared at frogface the imp had not been much good since that night he couldnt get near anybody except swan and his buddies in a dive they owned and they didnt talk business there you sure you want to go to this library im sure somehow the taglians had gotten the idea i was a big healer as well as some kind of messianic general what the hell is wrong with them i can see the prince trying to sell them the load of sheep shit but why are they buying it they want to mothers thrust their babies at me to be touched and blessed young men clashed anything metal and roared songs with a martial beat maidens threw flowers on my path and sometimes themselves thats nice croaker oneeye said as i disentangled myself from a daydream about sixteen years old you dont want her toss her my way take it easy before you give in to your baser instincts think about whats going on he was reserved to an extreme that baffled me i think he saw it all as illusion or at least as a honeytrap oneeye is silly but he isnt stupid sometimes oneeye chuckled surrender to temptation lady cant look over your shoulder all the time i might i just might it is my duty not to disappoint these people when theyre trying so hard to hustle us isnt it there you go but he did not sound like he believed himself he was uncomfortable with his good fortune we went into the library i found nothing so much nothing i got even more suspicious than i was frogface wasnt much use but he could eavesdrop the conversations he reported contributed to my concern it was a good time for the men even the supreme discipline of the nar was not proof against some temptations mogaba did not hold them on too tight a leash as goblin howled one morning heavens on fire croaker always there was this feeling of something happening just out of the comer of my eye the geopolitical situation was clear it was just as swan had described meaning that to reach khatovar we would have to slice through seven hundred miles of country ruled by the shadowmasters if shadowmasters there were i had some slight doubts everyone i talked to through frogface believed they existed but nobody provided any concrete evidence nobody has ever seen the gods either a priest told me but we all believe in them dont we we see their handiwork he realized that i had scowled at his suggestion that everyone believed in gods his eyes narrowed he scurried away for the first time i had found me somebody less than thrilled with my presence in taglios i told oneeye it might be more profitable if we started spying on the high priests instead of the prince and swan who knew when to keep their mouths shut that we were being manipulated into going up against some heavyweight sorcerers did not intimidate me much we had been up against the best for twenty years what troubled me was my ignorance i did not know the language i did not know the taglian people their history was a mystery and swans bunch were no help tossing light into the shadows and of course i knew nothing about the shadowmasters or the peoples they ruled nothing but what i had been told which could be worse than nothing worst of all i was not acquainted with the ground where any struggle would take place and i had too little time to learn all the answers sundown of the third day we moved to quarters farther south in the city provided by the state i gathered everyone but the halfdozen men on guard duty while most of the guys ate supper cooked and served by people provided by the prahbrindrah the folks at my long table got their heads together the rest had orders to keep the taglians hopping i doubted they could understand us but you dont take chances i sat at the head of the table lady to my left and mogaba to my right he with his two leading men next to him goblin and oneeye were beyond lady on her side tonight with goblin in the seat nearer the head i had to make them trade off each meal beyond them were murgen and hagop and otto with murgen at the foot of the table in his capacity as apprentice annalist i made like i was telling a story as we ate the paterfamilias entertaining his children im taking the imperial horses out tonight lady goblin hagop otto youll come one of the roi one of your lieutenants mogaba and one of your men men who can ride oneeye drew a breath to complain so did murgen but mogaba slid in ahead of both a sneak i want to scout to the south these people could be selling us a pig in a poke i didnt think they were but why take a mans word when you can see for yourself especially when hes trying to use you oneeye you stay here because i want you working your pet day and night murgen write down whatever he tells you mogaba cover for us if theyve been telling it straight we wont be gone long you told the prahbrindrah youd give him an answer in a week you have four days left well be back in time well go after next watch change after goblin and oneeye knock out anybody who might see us mogaba nodded i glanced at lady she didnt contribute much anymore if i wanted to be the boss i was going to be the boss and she would keep her opinion to herself mogaba said several of my men have approached me on a matter of some delicacy i think we need a policy this was something unexpected a policy about what to what extent the men can use violence to defend themselves several have been attacked they want to know how much restraint they have to show for political reasons or if they have permission to make examples gah when did this start i received the first report this afternoon all today then yes sir lets see the men involved he brought them to the table they were nar there were five of them it did not seem likely that such things would happen to the nar alone i sent murgen around he returned three incidents they took care of it themselves said they didnt figure it was something worth reporting discipline something to be said for it it took half a minute to decide the attackers were not apparently taglians wrinkly little brown guys we saw those on the river i asked swan he said he didnt know where they came from but they gave him the collywobbles if theyre not taglians dont take no shit ace them unless you can take a couple prisoners oneeye if you could snag a couple and give them the works we did all this amidst the comings and goings of our taglian servitors at that point several came to collect empty plates forestalling oneeye from poormouthing about how he was so grossly overworked he did not squawk fast enough when they cleared away either murgen got the first word in i got a problem croaker mogaba winced flexible man mogaba but he could not get used to me letting anybody call me anything but captain whats that bats goblin snickered can it runt bats what about bats guys keep finding dead bats around i noted from the corner of my eye that lady had grown more attentive i dont follow you the men have been finding dead bats every morning since we got here bats all torn up not just dropped over dead and theyre only around where we are not all over town i looked at oneeye he looked at me he said i know i know one more job for good old oneeye hows this outfit ever going to get along without me when i go i dont know if the others bought it or not there were things oneeye and i hadnt shared with everyone any other problems nobody had a problem but murgen had a question all right if we work on swan a little i checked out that place he owns its the kind of place some of our guys would hang out we might find out something interesting there at least youd keep him nervous good idea have some of the nar hang out there too to work on that blade character hes a spooky one otto said the most dangerous too id bet one of those guys like raven kill you without batting an eye and not even remember it five minutes later mogaba said you must tell me more of this raven each time i hear of him he sounds more intriguing lady paused with fork half lifted to mouth its all in the annals lieutenant the gentlest of admonitions for all his devotion to things company mogaba had yet to make a serious attempt to explore those annals set down after the company had departed geaxle of course he replied voice perfectly even but eyes hard as steel there was a distinct coolness between them i had sensed it before mildly negative chemistry neither had any reason to dislike the other or maybe they did i spent more time with mogaba these days than i did with lady thats that then i said out of here after the next watch change be ready mostly nods as they pushed back from the table but goblin stayed put scowling for several seconds before he rose he suspected that he was being drafted mainly to keep him out of mischief while i was gone he was sixty percent right chapter twentyfive taglios scouting southward try sneaking someplace on a plowhorse sometime youll get half the idea of the trouble we had sliding out of town unnoticed on those monsters lady had given us we wore poor goblin down to the nubs covering up by the time we cleared town i was thinking maybe we would have done as well to have taken the coach getting out unnoticed was a relative notion anyway there were crows on watch seemed one of those damned birds was perched on every tree and roof we passed though we hurried through it and it could not be seen well in the dark the countryside immediately south of taglios seemed rich and intensively cultivated it had to be to support an urban area so large though there appeared to be garden areas inside the city especially in the welltodo neighborhoods surprisingly taglians did not eat much meat though it was food that could be walked to market two of the three great religious families banned the eating of flesh along with everything else our great steeds could see in the dark it did not bother them to canter when i could not see my hand in front of my face dawn caught us forty miles south of taglios thoroughly saddlesore openedmouth peasants watched us flash by swan had told me about the shadowmasters invasion of the previous summer twice we crossed the path of that struggle coming upon gutted villages in each the villagers had rebuilt but not on the same site we paused near the second a hetman came to look us over while we ate we had no words in common when he saw he wasnt going to get anywhere he just grinned shook my hand and walked away goblin said he knew who we are and figures us the same as the people in the city for dopes nobody thinks were stupid croaker lady said and maybe thats the problem maybe we arent as smart as they think we are say what i threw a stone at a crow i missed she gave me a funny look i think youre right when you say theres a conspiracy of silence but maybe they arent hiding as much as you think maybe they just think we know more than we know sindawe mogabas lieutenant and third offered i feel this to be the heart of it captain i have spent much time on the streets i have seen this in the eyes of all who look upon me they think i am much more than what i am hey they dont just look at me i go out they start hailing me everything but emperor its embarrassing but they wont talk goblin said starting to pack up theyll bow and grin and kiss your backside and give you anything but their virgin daughters but they wont say squat if you go after a concrete answer truth is a deadly weapon lady said which is why priests and princes dread it i said if were more than we seem what do they think we are lady said what the company was when it came through heading north sindawe agreed the answer would be in the missing annals of course and theyre missing if i had had my own along i would have paused to review what i had learned at the temple of travellers repose those first few books had been lost down here somewhere none of the names on my maps rang any bells none of what i remembered contained any echoes chon delor had been the end of history so to speak the beginning of unknown country though there was much in the annals from before the pastel wars could they have changed all the names oh my aching ass goblin complained as he clambered into the saddle a sight to behold a runt like him getting up the side of one of those horses every time otto had a crack about getting him a ladder croaker i got an idea that sounds dangerous he ignored that how about we retire were not young enough for this crap anymore hagop said those guys we ran into on the road down from oar probably had the right idea only they were smalltime we ought to find a town and take over or sign on with somebody permanent like thats been tried fifty times never lasts only place it worked was geaxle and there the guys got itchy feet after a while bet that wasnt the same guys who rode in were all old and tired hagop speak for yourself granddad lady said i threw a rock and mounted up that was an invitation to banter i did not take it up i felt old and tired that way too she shrugged mounted up herself i rode out wondering where we were at she and i probably nowhere maybe the spark had been neglected too long maybe propinquity was counterproductive as we moved farther south we noted a phenomenon post riders in numbers like we had seen nowhere else in every village we were recognized it was the same old salute and cheer that started in taglios where they had them the young men came out with weapons im not much for morality but i felt morally reprehensible when i saw them as if i were somehow responsible for transmuting a pacific people into fireeyed militarists otto was of the opinion the weapons had been taken from last years invaders maybe some but most looked so old and rusted and brittle i would wish them only on my enemies the commission looked more improbable by the hour nowhere did we encounter evidence that taglians were anything but a pleasant friendly industrious people blessed with a land where survival was not a daytoday struggle but even these country folk seemed to devote most of their leisure time whence culture springs to their bewildering battalions of gods one signal victory i told lady when we were about eighty miles south of the city and these people will be psyched up to take any hardships the shadowmasters can dish out and if we take the commission and lose the first battle it wont matter anyway we wont be around to have to suffer the consequences thats my girl always thinking positive are you really going to take the commission not if i can help it thats why were out here but ive got a bad feeling that what i want wont have much to do with what ill have to do goblin snorted and grumbled something about being dragged around on the claws of fate he was right and my only notion for breaking loose was to find a way to keep heading south shadowmasters be damned we did not press hard and paused for lunch before our breakfasts were really settled our bodies were not up to the continuous abuse of a sustained ride getting old otto and hagop wanted to lay on a fire and fix a real meal i told them go ahead sore and tired i settled down nearby head pillowed on a rock and stared at clouds trudging across alien skies that by day looked no different than those whence i had come things were happening too fast and too strange to wring any sense out of them i was plagued by a dread that i was the wrong man in the wrong place and wrong time for the company i did not feel competent to handle the situation taglios threatened could i presume to lead a nation to war i did not think so even if every taglian man woman and child proclaimed me savior i tried comforting myself with the thought that i was not the first captain with doubts and far from the first to get embroiled in a local situation armed only with a glimmer of the true problems and stakes maybe i was luckier than some i had lady for whom the waters of intrigue were home if i could tap her talent i had mogaba who despite those cultural and language barriers that still existed between us had begun to look like the best pure soldier id ever known i had goblin and oneeye and frogface and maybe shifter and i had four hundred years of company shenanigans in my trick bag but none of that appeased my conscience or stilled my doubts what had we gotten into on our simple ride back into the companys origins was that half the trouble that we were in unknown territory so far as the annals were concerned that i was trying to work without a historical chart there were questions about our forebrethren and this country id had little opportunity to ferret out information the hints i had gathered suggested that those old boys had not been nice fellows i got the impression that the diaspora of the original free companies had been a nut religious thing the moving doctrine a vestige of which survived among the nar must have been terrible the name of the company still struck fear and stirred intense emotion the exhaustion caught up i fell asleep though i did not realize it till the conversation of crows awakened me i bounced up the others looked at me oddly they did not hear it they were about finished with their meal otto was keeping the pot hot for me i looked into a lone nearby tree and saw several crows their ugly heads all cocked so they could look at me they started chattering i had a definite feeling they wanted my attention i ambled toward them two flew when i was halfway to the tree gaining altitude in that clumsy way crows have gliding to the southeast toward an isolated stand of trees maybe a mile away a good fifty crows circled above those trees the remaining crow left the lone tree when he was satisfied i had seen that i turned to lunch in a thoughtful mood halfway through a bad stew i concluded that i had to assume i had been given a warning the road passed within yards of those trees as we mounted up i said people we ride with weapons bare goblin see those trees yonder keep an eye on them like your life depends on it whats up croaker i dont know just a hunch probably wrong but it dont cost nothing to be careful if you say so he gave me a funny look like he was wondering about my stability lady gave me an even funnier look when as we approached the woods goblin squeaked the place is infested thats all he got to say the infestation broke cover those little brown guys about a hundred of them real military geniuses too men on foot just dont go jumping people on horseback even if they do outnumber them goblin said gleep and then he said something else the swarm of brown men became surrounded by a fog of insects they should have shot us down with arrows otto and hagop chose what i considered the stupider course they charged their momentum carried them through the mob my choice seemed the wiser the others agreed we just turned away and trotted ahead of the brown guys leaving them to goblins mercies my beast stumbled master horseman that i am i promptly fell off before i could get to my feet the brown guys were all around me trying to lay hands on but goblin was on the job i dont know what he did but it worked after they knocked me around a little leaving me a fine crop of bruises they decided to keep after those who had had sense enough to stay on their horses otto and hagop thundered past making a rear attack i staggered to my feet looked for my mount he was a hundred yards away looking at me in a bemused sort of way i limped toward him those little guys had some kind of petty magic of their own going and no sense at all they just kept on they dropped like flies but when they outnumber you a dozen to one you got to worry about more than just a favorable kill ratio i did not see it well busy as i was and when i did manage to drag my abused flesh aboard my animals back the whole brouhaha had swept out of sight down a narrow shallow valley i have no idea how but somehow i managed to get disoriented or something when i got organized and started after my bunch i could not find them though i never got much chance to look fate intervened in the form of five little brown guys on horses that would have been amusing if they hadnt been waving swords and lances and rushing at me with intent to be obnoxious on another day i might have stayed forty yards ahead and plinked at them with my bow but i wasnt in the mood i just wanted to be left alone and to get back together with the others i galloped off up and down and around a few hills and i lost them easily but in the process i lost myself during all the fun the sky clouded over it started to drizzle just to make me that much more enchanted with my chosen way of life i set out to find the road hoping i would find traces of my companions there i topped a hill and spied that damned crowsurrounded figure that had been haunting me since the temple of travellers respose it was striding along in the distance directly away from me i forgot about the others i kicked my mount into a gallop the figure paused and looked back i felt the weight of its stare but did not slow i would unravel this mystery now i charged down a shallow hill leapt a wash in which muddy water gurgled the figure was out of sight for a moment up the other side when i reached the crest there was nothing to be seen but a few random crows circling no particular point i used language that would have distressed my mother immensely i did not slow but continued my career till i reached the approximate point where i had seen the thing last i reined in swung down began stomping around looking for sign a mighty tracker me but moist as the ground was already there had to be traces unless i was crazy and seeing things i found traces sure enough and i felt the continued pressure of that stare but i did not see the thing i sought i was baffled even considering the probability that there was sorcery involved how could it have vanished so completely there was no cover anywhere around i spotted some crows starting to circle about a quarter mile away all right you son of a bitch well see how fast you can run there was nothing there when i got there the cycle repeated itself three times i got no closer the last time i halted i did so atop a low crest that from a quarter mile overlooked a hundredacre wood i dismounted and stood beside my horse we stared you too i asked his breathing was as uneven as mine and those monster beasts never got winded that was a sight down there never have i seen so many crows except maybe on a recent battlefield in a lifetime of travel and study i have come upon half a hundred tales about haunted forests the woods are always described as dark and dense and old or the trees are mostly dead skeleton hands reaching for the sky this wood fit none of the particulars except for density yet it sure felt haunted i tossed my reins across the horses neck strapped on a buckler drew my sword from its saddle scabbard and started forward the horse came along behind me maybe eight feet back head down so his nostrils were almost to the ground like a hound on the track the crows were most numerous over the center of the wood i did not trust my eyes but thought i detected some squat dark structure among the trees there the closer i got the slower i moved meaning maybe a part of me was still infected with common sense the part that kept telling me that i was not cut out for this sort of thing i wasnt some lone brawling swordsman who stalked evil into its lair i am a dope cursed with an unhealthy portion of curiosity curiosity had me by the chin whiskers and kept right on dragging me along there was one lone tree that approximated the stereotype a bony old thing about half dead as big around as me standing like a sentinel thirty feet from the rest of the wood scrub and saplings clustered around its feet rising waist high i paused to lean against it while i talked myself into or out of something the horse came up till his nose bumped my shoulder i turned my head to look at him snake hiss thump i gawked at the arrow quivering in the tree three inches from my fingers and only started to get myself down when it struck me that the shaft had not been meant to stick me in the brisket head shaft and fletching that bolt was as black as a priests heart the shaft itself had an enameled look an inch behind the head was a wrap of white i levered the arrow out of the tree and held the message close enough to read it is not yet time croaker the language and alphabet were those of the jewel cities interesting right not yet time i peeled the paper off crumpled it into a ball tossed it at the wood i looked for some sign of the archer there was none of course i shoved the arrow into my quiver swung onto my saddle turned the horse and rode about a step a shadow ran past of a crow flying up to have a look at the seven little brown men waiting for me atop the hill you guys never give up do you i got back down behind the horse took out my bow strung it drew an arrow the arrow just collected and started angling across the hillside staying behind my mount the little brown guys turned their toy horses and moved with me when i had a nice range i jumped out and let fly at the nearest he saw it coming and tried to dodge only he did himself more harm than good i meant to put the shaft into his ponys neck it slammed in through his knee getting him and the animal both the pony threw him and took off dragging him from a stirrup i mounted up fast took off through the gap those little horses did not move fast enough to close it so we were off them pounding after me at a pace to kill their animals in an hour my beast barely cantering and i think having a good time i cant recall any other horse ive ridden looking back to check the pursuit and adjusting its pace to remain tantalizingly close i had no idea who the brown guys were but there had to be a bunch of them the way they kept turning up i considered working on this bunch taking them out one by one decided discretion was the better part if need be i could bring the company down and forage for them i wondered what became of lady and goblin and the others i doubted they had come to any harm what with our advantage in mounts but we were separated and there was no point spending the remaining daylight looking for them i would get back to the road turn north find a town and someplace dry the drizzle irritated me more than the fact that i was being hunted but that stretch of forest bothered me more than the rain that was a mystery that scared the crap out of me the crows and walking stump were real no doubt of that anymore and the stump knew me by name maybe i ought to bring the company down and go after whatever hid there the road was one of those wonders that turns to mud hip deep if somebody spits on it there were no fences in this part of the world so i just rode beside it i came to a village almost immediately call it a stroke of fate or timing timing my life runs on weird timing there were riders coming into town from the north they looked even more bedraggled than i felt they were not little brown men but i gave them the suspicious eye anyway and looked for places to duck they were carrying more lethal hardware than i was and i had enough to outfit a platoon yo croaker hell that was murgen i got a little closer and saw that the other three were willow swan cordy mather and blade what the hell were they doing down here chapter twentysix overlook the one who had withdrawn everything but moral support did not give up his right to complain and criticize the gathering of the shadowmasters took place in the heights of a soaring tower in that ones new capitol fortress overlook which lay two miles south of shadowcatch it was a strange dark fortress more vast than some cities it had thick walls a hundred feet high every vertical surface was sheathed in plates of burnished brass or iron ugly silver lettering in an alphabet known only to a few damascened those plates proclaiming fearful banes the shadowmasters assembled in a room not at all in keeping with their penchant for darkness the sun burned through a skylight and through walls of crystal the three shrank from the glare though they were clad in their darkest apparel their host floated near the southern wall seldom withdrawing his gaze from the distance his preoccupation was obsessive out there many miles away but visible from that great height lay a vast flat expanse it shimmered it was as white as the corpse of an old dead sea the visitors thought his fear and fixation dangerously obsessive if it was not feigned if it was not the fulcrum of an obscure and deadly strategem but it was impossible not to be impressed by the magnitude of the defenses he had raised the fortress had been seventeen years in the building and was not yet more than twothirds completed the small one the female asked its quiet out there now she spoke the language that was emblazoned upon the fortress walls its always quiet during the day but come the night come the night fear and hatred blackened the air he blamed them for his dire circumstances they had mined the shadows and had awakened the terror then they had left him to face the consequences alone he turned you have failed you have failed and failed and failed the radisha went north without inconvenience they sailed through the swamps like vengeance itself so easily she never had to lift a finger they go where they will and do what they will without peril so blithely sure they dont even notice your meddling and now they and she are on your marches conjuring mischief there so you come to me who could have suspected they would have a great one as companion that one was supposed to have perished fool was he not a master of change and illusion you should have known he was there waiting for them how could such a one hide did you know he was there and fail to inform us the female mocked he whirled back to the window he did not answer he said they are on your marches now will you deal with them this time they are but fifty mortal men with her and the great one and we are four and we have armies soon the rivers will go down ten thousand men will cross the main and obliterate the very name of the black company a sound came from the one at the window a hissing that grew up to become cold mocking laughter they will that has been tried numberless times numberless but they endure for four hundred years they have endured ten thousand men you joke a million might not suffice the empire in the north could not exterminate them the three exchanged glances here was madness obsession and madness when the threat from the north was expunged perhaps this one ought to follow it come here he said look down there where that ghost of an old road winds through the valley up toward the brilliance something turned and coiled there a blackness deeper than that of their apparel you see that what is it my shadow trap they come through the gateway you breached the great old strong ones not the toys you drew into your services these i could loose them i might if you fail again the three stirred he had to go for certain he laughed reading their thoughts and the key to that trap is my name my brethren if i perish the trap collapses and the gateway stands open to the world he laughed again the male who spoke the least when they gathered spat angrily and made to depart after hesitating the other two followed there was nothing more to be said mad laughter pursued them down the endless spiral of the stairs the woman observed maybe he cant be conquered but while he persists in facing south he offers us no peril let us ignore him henceforth three against two then her companion grumbled the other in the lead grunted but there is one in the swamps whose debt of anger might be manipulated if we grow desperate and we have gold always there are tools to be found in the ranks of the enemy when gold is allowed to speak not so she laughed her laughter was almost as crazy as that peeling out above chapter twentyseven night strife i gave murgen my dirtiest look as he rode up he understood it we would talk later for the moment he said you told me to keep an eye on them swan reached me a moment later gods you guys move fast im shot he made an obscene gesture at the sky we leave five minutes after you and find out you had time to take a couple of breaks and still stay ahead of us he shook his head bunch of iron men told you i wasnt cut put for this crap cordy where is everybody murgen asked i dont know we got ambushed we got separated mather swan and blade exchanged glances swan asked little brown guys all wrinkly you know them we had a runin with them when we were headed north man i got me a brainstorm we going to jaw lets do it out of the rain my lumbago is killing me lumbago mather asked when did you come up with lumbago when i forgot my hat and it started raining on my head blade you was in this place last year they got like an inn or something blade didnt say anything just turned his horse and headed out he was an odd one for sure but swan thought he was an allright guy and i liked swan as much as i could like anybody who worked for somebody who was trying to play games with me i was about to follow up last with murgen when murgen said hold up somebodys coming he pointed i looked into the drizzle to the south and saw three shapes riders coming in their mounts were tall enough that they could be nothing but ladys gifts swan cursed the delay but we waited the three were hagop otto and the roi shadid shadid looked ragged and hagop and otto were wounded damn you two cant you take a crap without getting hurt in the thirty or so years i had known them it seemed they had come up wounded about three times a year and survived everything id begun to suspect they were immortal and the blood was the price they paid they piled an ambush on top of the ambush croaker hagop said they ran us down that valley right into another gang on horseback my stomach tightened and he put on a feeble grin i figure theyre sorry they did we cut them up bad where are the others i dont know we scattered lady said for shadid to ride back up here with us and wait she led them off all right blade why dont you show us where to roost murgen looked at me with a question unspoken i told him yeah well get them settled then well go the place blade took us wasnt really an inn just a big house where the owner made a bit taking in travellers he was not thrilled to see us though like everybody else in this end of the world he seemed to know who we were the color of our coin brightened his day and livened his smile still i think he let us in mainly because he thought we would get rowdy if he didnt i got otto and hagop sewed up and bandaged and generally settled into a routine they knew all too well meanwhile the householder brought food for which swan expressed our sincere gratitude murgen said its going to be getting dark croaker i know swan were going put to find the others got a spare horse if you want to ride along you kidding go out in that muck when i dont have to hell all right i guess he started levering himself out of his chair sit down willow mather said ill go im in better shape than you are swan said you talked me into it you smoothtalking son of a bitch i dont know how you do it you goldentongued bastard you can get anything you want out of me be careful ready mather asked me he stifled a small smile yeah we went out and climbed onto the horses who were beginning to look a little putupon i led out but shadid soon slipped past suggesting he lead since he knew whence they had come the day was getting on the light was feeble it was about as dreary as it could get more to distract myself than because i cared i told murgen better explain whats going on cordy can tell you better than me i just stuck with them the roi was not setting a blistering pace i fought down the growls breeding in my gut i kept telling me she was a big girl and shed been taking care of herself since before i was born but the man in me kept saying thats your woman you got to take care of her sure cordy i know you guys dont work for me and you got your own priorities but nothing to cover up captain word came that some of you guys was going to ride out that boggled the woman she figured you all to make a break for the main in a mob and learn about the shadowmasters the hard way instead you went to scout it she didnt think you were that smart were talking about the old broad you guys brought down the river right the radisha yeah we call her the woman blade hung it on her before we knew who she was and she knew we were heading out before we went interesting this is a wondrous time of my life mr mather for the last year everybody in the world has known what i was going to do before i did its enough to make a guy nervous we passed some trees in one i spied this incredibly bedraggled crow i laughed and hoped aloud he was as miserable as me the others eyed me uncertainly i wondered if i shouldnt start cultivating a new image work it up slowly all the world dreads a madman if i played it right hey cordy old travelling buddy you sure you dont know anything about those little brown guys all i know is they tried to ice us when we was headed north nobody ever saw anybody like them before they figure to be out of the shadowlands why are the shadowmasters paranoid about us i did not expect an answer i did not get one cordy you guys really serious about winning it for the prahbrindrah i am for taglios i found something there i never found anywhere else willow too though you could roast him and never get it out of him i dont know about blade i guess hes in because were in hes got one and a half friends in the world and nothing else to live for hes just going on one and a half willow hes got im the half we pulled him out when somebody threw him to the crocodiles he stuck because he owed us a life after what weve been through since then if you was keeping accounts you couldnt figure who owes who what anymore i cant tell you about the real blade he never lets you see that what are we into or is that something you figure you shouldnt tell me what theres more going on than your woman and the prahbrindrah trying to get us to keep the shadowmasters out otherwise theyd make a straight deal instead of trying to con us we travelled a mile while he thought he finally said i dont know for sure i think theyre doing the way they are because of the way the black company did taglios before i thought so and we dont know what our forebrethren did and no one will tell us its like one giant conspiracy where everybody in taglios wont tell us anything in a city that big youd think id find one guy with an axe to grind youd find platoons if you looked in the right place all them priests spend their lives looking to cut each others throats he had given me something there i wasnt sure what ill keep it in mind i dont know if i can handle priests though theyre like any other guys if you get your bluff in the gloom closed in tighter as the day advanced i was so soaked i no longer paid that much attention we hit a stretch where we had to go single file cordy and murgen dropped back i picked up a few things ill tell you about later murgen said before he went i moved up behind the roi to ask how much farther it was just the misery of the day but i felt like id been travelling for weeks something whipped across our path so suddenly that that unflappable mount of shadids reared and whinnied he shouted what the hell was that in his native tongue i understood because id learned a few words when i was a kid i caught only a glimpse it looked like a monster grey wolf with a deformed pup clinging to its back it vanished before my eye could track it do wolves do that carry their young on their backs i laughed almost hysterically why worry about that when i ought to be wondering if there was such a thing as a wolf the size of a pony murgen and cordy caught up and wanted to know what had happened i said i didnt know because i was no longer sure i had seen what i had seen but the wonder lay back there in the shadows of my mind ripening shadid stopped two miles past the place where wed been ambushed originally it was getting hard to see he peered around trying to read landmarks he grunted moved out to his left off the road i spied signs suggesting this was the way he had come with otto and hagop after another half mile the ground dropped into a small valley where a narrow creek ran rocks stuck up seemingly at random likewise trees grew in scatters it was now so dark i could not see more than twenty feet we started finding bodies a lot of little brown men had died for their cause whatever that was shadid stopped again we led them in from the other direction heres where we split we went up that way the others held on to give us a head start he dismounted began snooping around the light was almost gone before he found the track out of the valley it was full dark before we covered a mile murgen said maybe we ought to go back and wait we cant accomplish much stumbling around in the dark you go back if you want i snapped with a savagery that surprised me im staying till i find i could not see him but i suspected he was grinning through his misery he said maybe we shouldnt split up that much more trouble getting everybody back together riding through the night in unfamiliar territory is not one of the smarter things ive done especially with a horde out there that wanted to do me harm but the gods take care of fools i guess our mounts stopped their ears pricked after a moment mine made a sound a moment later still that sound was repeated from our left quarter without being urged the animals turned that way we found sindawe and the man hed brought in a crude bough shelter their mounts hanging around outside both were injured sindawe the worst we talked briefly while i did some stitching and patching and bandaging lady had ordered them to disappear goblin had covered for them while the pursuit went on off to the southeast they had planned to head north in the morning i told them where to meet up then got back into my saddle i was dead on my butt barely able to stay upright but something made me go on something i did not want to examine too closely lest i have to mock myself for my sentiment i got no arguments though i think mather was getting a little unsure of my sanity i heard him whispering with murgen and murgen telling him to can it i took the lead and gave my horse his head telling him to find ladys mount id never determined how intelligent the beasts were but it seemed worth a try and the animal went walking though his pace was a little slow to suit me i dont know how long the ride went on there was no way to estimate time after a while i began drifting off and coming awake with a start then drifting off again near as i could tell the others were doing the same thing i could have raised hell with them and me both but that would have been unreasonable reasonable men would have been in a warm room back at that village snoring i was about half awake when the crest of a hill half a mile ahead burst into flames it was like an explosion one moment darkness the next several acres ablaze and men and animals scattering burning too the smell of sorcery was so strong i could detect it go horse there was light enough for it to risk a trot a minute later i was moving over ground dotted by smoldering twitching bodies little brown men one hell of a lot of little brown men the flaming trees illuminated a racing silhouette a gigantic wolf with a smaller wolf astride clinging with paws and claws what the hell is that mather demanded murgen guessed that shifter croaker maybe probably we know hes around somewhere lady i yelled it at the burning trees the fire was dying in the drizzle a sound that might have been an answer slithered through the crackling where are you here something moved amidst an outcrop of small rocks i jumped down goblin where the hell are you no goblin just lady and now not enough light to see how badly she was hurt and hurt she was no doubt about that a fool damned thing to do and me a physician who ought to know better but i sat down and pulled her into my lap and held her rocking her like a baby the mind goes from the minute you sign on with the company youre doing things that make no sense drills and practices and rehearsals so that when the crunch comes youll do the right thing automatically without thought the mind goes i was without thought of anything but loss i did not do the right thing i was lucky i had companions whose brains had not turned to mud they got together enough burnable wood to get a fire started got me my gear and with a little judicious yelling got me to stop fussing and start doing she wasnt as bad off as shed seemed in the dark a few cuts a lot of bruises maybe a concussion to account for her grogginess the old battlefield reflexes took over i became a military physician again murgen joined me after a while i found her horse no sign of goblin though how is she better than she looks banged around some but nothing critical shell hurt all over for a while about then her eyelids fluttered she looked up at me and recognized me she threw herself at me wrapped her arms around me and started crying shadid said something murgen chuckled yeah lets see if we can find goblin cordy mather was a beat slow but he got it and went away too she settled down quickly she was who she was and was not in the habit of yielding to her emotions she peeled herself off me excuse me croaker nothing to excuse you had a close call what happened i was going to ask you they had me they had me dead croaker i thought wed given them the slip but they knew right where we were they split us apart and ran me up here and there must have been a dozen of them sneaking around jumping in on me and jumping away they were trying to capture me not kill me guess i should be glad otherwise id be dead but theres some time missing i dont remember you showing up and running them off i didnt near as i can tell shifter saved you i told her about the sudden fire and the wolf maybe i didnt know he was around wheres goblin i dont know we split about a mile from here he tried to baffle them with illusions we must have killed a hundred of those men today croaker i never saw anybody so inept but they never stopped coming when we tried to outrun them there were always more in ambush no matter which way we went if we tried to fight they always outnumbered us and two more turned up for every one we killed it was a nightmare they always knew where we were she snuggled in close again there had to be some kind of sorcery involved i was never so scared its all right now its over it was the best i could think to say now that my nerves were settled i was intensely aware of her as a woman what appeared to be lightning flashed to the east several miles away but there had been no lightning running with this petty drizzle i heard shadid and murgen and mather yelling at each other then the sounds of their mounts moving away thats got to be goblin i said and started to get up she tightened her grip held me down they can handle it croaker i looked down it did not take much light to show me what was in her face yeah i guess they can after a moments hesitation i did what she wanted as the breathing got heavier i broke away and said youre not in any shape for shut up croaker i shut up and paid attention to business chapter twentyeight back to scouting the pinhead gods had other ideas i am not a swift worker and lady had her natural reluctances and all of a sudden the sky opened up like somebody chopped open the bellies of the clouds the downpour was heavy and cold and came with just a breath or two of chill wind for warning id have thought i was already wet enough not to mind more but wed hardly stopped scrambling around trying to find some shelter when murgen and the others came out of the night murgen said it was goblin all right but he was gone when we got there he assumed i knew what he was talking about croaker i know us black company types is tough hemen and neither rain nor snow nor little brown geeks is supposed to stop us from doing any damned thing we want but im burned out on this rain i guess i got what you call conditioned at the barrowland i cant handle too much of it i get the collywobbles i was burned out on it too especially now it was coming down serious but what about goblin what about him ill make you a bet croaker that little dork is all right goddamned well better off than we are eh this is where command really gets you when you make a choice that feels like youre taking the easy way out when you think you are taking convenience over obligation right then lets see if we cant find our way back to town i let go ladys hand we got ourselves in better array those guys pretended not to notice i supposed the troops back in taglios would know before sunrise somehow rumor works that way damn i wished i was guilty as suspected we reached the village as the world began to turn grey even those fabulous mounts of ours were worn out we boothorned them into a stable meant for half a dozen normal animals and went clumping inside i was sure the owner would be thrilled to death to see his clientele expanded again and looking like theyd just spent the night rolling around in the mud the old boy wasnt around instead a pudgy little woman appeared from the kitchen looked at us like she thought the barbarians had invaded then saw lady lady looked just as rough as the rest of us just as mean but there was no mistaking her for a guy the old gal rushed her and babbled in taglian and reached up to pat her back and i didnt need cordy to tell me she was doing an oh you poor dear routine we followed them back into the kitchen and there was friend goblin leaning back with his feet up on a log in front of a fire sipping something from a huge mug get the little bastard murgen said and started after him goblin bounced up and squeaked croaker where you been runt sitting here drinking toddies while were out stomping in the mud trying to save your butt from the baddies eh murgen got him cornered hey no i just got here myself wheres your horse the stable was one short when we put ours in its pretty miserable out there i left it out back and came straight inside its not miserable for a horse murgen throw him out and dont let him back inside till he takes care of his horse not that we had done all that decent a job ourselves but wed at least gotten them in out of the wet cordy when the old gal finishes fussing over lady ask her how far it is to the main the main youre not still im still as soon as i get some chow inside me and a couple hours of sleep its what i came down for and its what im going to do your pals have been running a game on us whatever their reasons and i dont like it if i can take the company on without getting drafted into somebodys fight im going to do it he sort of smiled all right if you have to see for yourself see for yourself but be careful goblin came in looking sheepish and conciliatory and wet where are you going now croaker where we were going in the first place the river maybe i can save you the trouble i doubt it but lets hear it you find out something while you were adventuring on your own his eyes narrowed sorry it wasnt one of my alltime best nights youre having a lot of notsogood times in recent years croaker being captain gives you a sour stomach yeah we exchanged stares i won the lookdown he said after lady and i split up i only got about half a mile before i realized them brown guys werent being fooled i knew i did a good job with the illusion if they didnt all come after me then they had some mojo of their own somewhere i already suspected they did on account of how they stuck all the time even when we outran them so i figured if i couldnt get back to lady id do the next best thing and go after whoever was controlling and guiding them when i started sniffing around for it it was damned easy to find and they gave me no trouble i guess they figured if i would go away from lady theyd leave me alone only a few stuck with me i turned on them and uncorked a few specials i was saving for the next time oneeye got out of line and after they all stopped kicking i buzzed over there and sneaked up and there was this hilltop that had been sort of hollowed out like a bowl and down in the bowl there was these six guys all facing a little fire only there was something weird you couldnt see them right it was like you was looking at them through a fog only the fog was black sort of lots of little shadows id guess youd call them some of them no bigger than a mouses shadow all buzzing around like bees he was talking as fast as his mouth would go yet i knew he was having trouble telling what he had seen that words for what he wanted to convey did not exist at least in any languages us mundanes would understand i think they were seeing what we were doing in the flames then sending those shadows out to tell their boys what to do to us and how to get into our way hunh maybe you were lucky not dealing with them so much in the daytime right i figured id had troubles enough chasing a walking treestump around the countryside see any crows while you were at it he looked at me funny yeah as a matter of fact see i was laying there in the mud looking at these guys trying to figure what i had in the trick bag that i could smack them with and all of a sudden theres about twenty crows swooping around the whole thing blew up like it was raining naptha instead of water cooked those brown guys good only those crows maybe werent crows you know what i mean not till you tell me i only saw them for a second but it seemed like i could see right through them you always do i muttered and he looked at me weird again so you figure any of the brown guys whore still out there are wandering around lost now like puppies without their masters i wouldnt say that i figure theyre as smart as you or me well as smart as you anyway they just dont have their advantage anymore the old woman was still fussing over lady she had taken her somewhere to get bathed and patched up as if she needed patching how does this save me a trip to the main im not finished yet your grand impatience right after the blowup here came one of the guys i thought id finished tracking me down all on his lonesome and hes stumbling around holding his head like something got ripped out i grabbed him and i grabbed a couple loose shadows that were hanging around and i slapped one of them around a little and sent it off to tell oneeye i needed to borrow his little beast i taught another shadow how to make a guy talk and when the little monster showed up we asked the brown guy a few hundred questions frogface is here he went back mogabas got them working their butts off up there good for him you asked questions you got answers not that made much sense these little brown guys come from a berg called shadowcatch specifically out of some kind of superfortress called overlook their boss is one of the shadowmasters longshadow they call him he gave the shadows to the six guys that was in the bowl place these were just wimpy little shadows not good for much but carrying messages they supposedly got bad ones they can turn loose too were having some fun now arent we you find out whats going on this longshadow is up to something hes in with the whole bunch trying to keep the company away the brown guys didnt know why theyre worried but hes running a game on his own too the impression i got was he wanted them to capture you and lady and have you dragged down to his castle where he was going to make some kind of deal maybe and thats about it i had five hundred questions and i started asking them but goblin didnt have the answers the man he had interrogated hadnt had them most of the questions had occurred to him he asked so are you going down to the main you havent changed my mind neither have those brown runts if they dont have their mojo men anymore they wont give me much trouble will they goblin groaned probably not so whats the matter you think im going to let you ride out there without some kind of cover im groaning about the state of my butt he grinned his big frog grin i grinned back according to our hosts it was a fourhour ride to the ghoja ford the nearest and best crossing over the main swan said there were four along an eightymile stretch of the main theri numa ghoja and vehdnabota theri being the farthest upriver above theri the main coursed through rugged canyons too steep and bleak for military operations though goblin said our little brown friends had come that way to evade the attention of the other shadowmasters they had lost a third of their number making the journey vehdnabota lay nearest the sea and was useful only during the driest months of the year the eighty miles of river between vehdnabota and the sea were always impassable both vehdnabota and theri fords took their names from taglian villages that had been abandoned when the shadowmasters had invaded last year they remained empty numa and ghoja were villages below the main formerly taglian now occupied ghoja appeared to be the critical crossing and swan mather and blade had all seen it they told me what they could i asked about the other fords and made an amusing discovery each was unfamiliar with at least one ha me and goblin will scout the ghoja crossing murgen you and cordy check out vehdnabota shadid you and swan go to numa sindawe you and blade check out theri i was sending each of the three into strange country cordy laughed swan scowled and blade well i wonder if you could get a reaction out of blade by sticking his feet in a fire we split up lady otto hagop and sindawes man all stayed behind to recuperate goblin rode beside me but did not say much after he hoped the weather would not go sour again he did not sound like he expected the drizzle to hold off swan said he had heard the shadowmasters were fortifying the south bank of the ghoja ford another indication the enemy would put his main force over there i hoped it would come out that way on the maps the terrain looked very favorable two hours after we split the drizzle resumed perfect weather for the dreary thoughts tramping my brain despite my adventure yesterday it seemed forever since i had been alone long enough to think a thought through so with goblin still as the grave i expected to do some serious brooding about where lady and i were going but she hardly crossed my mind instead i mulled over what id gotten me and the company into i was in charge but not in control as far back as that monastery things had been happening that i could not control and could not unravel into sense geaxle and the river worsened matters now i felt like driftwood tumbling through a rapid i had only the slightest idea who was doing what to whom and why but i was locked into the middle of it unless this last frantic gesture showed me an out for all i knew if i let the prahbrindrah suck me in i would be enlisting on the wrong side now i knew how the captain felt when soulcatcher dragged us into the ladys service we were fighting in the forsberg campaigns before the rest of us began to suspect wed made a mistake it is not necessary for mercenary soldiers to know what is going on it is sufficient for them to do the job for which they have taken the gold that had been drummed into me from the moment i enlisted there is neither right nor wrong neither good nor evil only our side and theirs the honor of the company lies within directed one brother toward another without honor lies only in keeping faith with the sponsor nothing i knew of the companys experiences resembled our present circumstance for the first time mainly by my doing we were fighting for ourselves first our contract if we accepted it would be coincidental to our own desires a tool if i kept my head and perspective as i should taglios and all taglians would become instruments of our desires yet i doubted i liked what i had seen of the taglian people and especially liked their spirit after the wounds they had taken keeping their independence they were still fired up for the shadowmasters and i had a good notion i wouldnt like those folks if i got to know them so before it was fairly begun id broken the prime rule and become emotionally involved fool that i am that damned rain had a personal grudge it got no heavier but it never let up yet to east and west i saw light that indicated clear skies in those directions the gods if such existed were laying on the misery especially for me the last tenanted place we passed lay six miles from the ghoja ford beyond the countryside had been abandoned it had been empty for months it was not bad land either the locals must have had a big fear on to uproot and flee a change of overlords usually isnt that traumatic for peasants the five thousand who had come north and not returned must have had a real way about them the country was not rugged it was mostly cleared land that rolled gently and the road was not awful considering though it had not been built to carry military traffic nowhere did i see any fortifications manmade or natural id seen none of the former anywhere in taglian territory there would be no place to run and few places to hide in the event of disaster i became a bit more respectful of swan and his buddies daring what they had the ground when soaked became a clayey clinging mud that exercised the strength and patience even of my tireless steed note to the chief of staff plan our battles for clear dry days right and while were at it lets order up only blind enemies you have to take what is handed you in this trade youre damned broody today croaker goblin said after a long while me you been chattering like a stone yourself im troubled about all this he was troubled that was a very ungoblinlike remark it meant he was worried right down to his toenails you dont think we can handle it if we have to take the commission he shook his head i dont know maybe you always grab something out of the trick bag but were getting worn out croaker theres no zest in it anymore what if we did pull it off and broke through and got to khatovar and ended up with a big nothing thats been the risk since we started i never claimed anything for this trip its just something i thought had to be done because i pledged to do it and when i turn the annals over to murgen ill extract the same oath from him i guess we dont have anything better to do to the end of the world and back again its an accomplishment of sorts i wonder about the first purpose so do i old friend it got lost somewhere between here and geaxle and i think these taglians know something about it but theyre not talking going to have to try some oldfashioned company double shuffle on them sometime the drizzle had its good side i suppose it lessened visibility we were over the last crest and headed down toward the main and ghoja ford before i realized we had come that far sentries on the south bank would have spotted us immediately in better weather goblin sensed it first were there croaker the rivers right down there we reined in i asked you feel anything on the other side people not alert but theres a couple poor fools on sentry duty what kind of outfit does it feel like sloppy third rate i could get a better look if i had a little time take some time im going to roam around and look it over the site was what i had been told it would be the road wandered down a long bare slope to the ford which lay just above an elbow in the river below the elbow a creek ran into the river from my side though i had to go make sure because it lay behind higher ground the creek had a beard of the usual growth along both banks there was also a slight rise in the other direction so that the road to the ford ran down the center of a slight concavity above the ford the river arched southward in a slow lazy curve on my side its bank was anywhere from two to eight feet high and overgrown with trees and brush everywhere but at the crossing itself i examined all that very carefully on foot while my mount waited with goblin beyond the ridge i sneaked down to the edge of the ford itself and spent a half hour sitting in the wet bushes staring at the fortifications on the other side we were not going to get across here not easily were they worried about us coming to them why i used the old triangulation trick to figure out that the watchtower of the fortress stood about seventy feet high then withdrew and tried to calculate what could be seen from its parapet most of the light was gone when i finished find out what you need to know goblin asked when i rejoined him i think so not what i wanted either unless you can cheer me up could we force a crossing against whats in there now probably with the water down if we tried in the dead of the night and caught them napping and when the water does go down theyll have ten thousand men hanging around over there dont look good does it no lets find a place to get out of the rain i can stand to ride back if you can lets try well sleep dry if we make it what do you think of the men over there professionals my guess is theyre just a little better than men disguised as soldiers they looked pretty sloppy to me too but maybe they dont have to be any better in these parts i had seen and watched four men while i was crouching near the ford they had not impressed me neither had the design or construction of the fortifications clearly these shadowmasters had brought in no professionals to train their forces and they had not developed a good edge on what they did have course maybe we saw what we were supposed to see theres always that an interesting thought maybe worth some consideration because at that moment i noticed a couple of bedraggled crows watching us from a dead branch on an elm tree i started to look around for the stump thought the hell with it i would handle that when the time came you remember shifters woman goblin yeah so you said you thought she seemed familiar back in geaxle now its all of a sudden coming on me that maybe you were right im sure we ran into her somewhere before but i cant for the life of me think where or when does it matter probably not just one of those things that nag at you lets cut off to the left here what the hell for theres a town on the map called vejagedhya that i want to look at i thought we were going back itll only take a few minutes extra right grumble grumble ragglesnatz looks like we might have to fight i need to know the country fraggin snigglebark we ate cold food as we rode it is not often that i do so but at such moments i sometimes envy the man with a cottage and wife everything costs something it was ghost country we rode spooky country the hand of man was evident everywhere even in darkness some of the homes we inspected looked like they had been closed up only yesterday but not once did we encounter another human being im surprised thieves havent been working all this dont tell oneeye i forced a chuckle i guess they were smart enough to take their valuables with them these people do seem determined to pay whatever price they have to dont they he sounded impressed grudgingly i was developing a case of respect and it looks like the company is going to be their one toss of the bones with fate if you let them there was the town vejagedhya it might once have been home to as many as a thousand people now it was even more spooky than the abandoned farms out there at least we had encountered wildlife in the town i saw nothing but a few crows fluttering from roof to roof the townsfolk had not locked their doors we checked maybe two dozen buildings it would do for a headquarters i told goblin he grunted after a while he asked you making up your mind beginning to look made up for me right but well see what the others have to say we headed north goblin did not have much to say after that that gave me time to dwell on and invent deeper meanings to my roles as captain and potential warlord if there was no choice but to fight and to lead a nation i was going to make demands i was not going to let the taglians put me in a position where they could secondguess and override my every decision i had watched my predecessors get half crazy dealing with that if the taglians hooked me i was going to hook them right back we might call it something prettier but by damn i was going to be a military dictator me croaker the itinerant military physician and amateur historian able to indulge in all the abuses id damned in princes for so long it was a sobering notion if we bought it and took the commission and i got what i would demand i might have wheezer follow me around and remind me that im mortal he wasnt good for much else the rain let up as we were riding into town now i knew the gods loved me chapter twentynine smokes hideout smoke was perched on a tall stool bent over a huge old book the room was filled with books it looked like a wave of books had swept in and left tidal pools behind not only were there shelves dripping books there were books stacked hiphigh on the floor books on tables and chairs even books piled on the sill of the rooms one small high window smoke read by the light of a single candle the room was sealed so tight the smoke had begun to irritate his nose and eyes from time to time he grunted made a note on a piece of paper to his left he was lefthanded in all the palace that room was the best protected from spying eyes smoke had woven webs and walls of spells to secure it no one was supposed to know about it it did not show on any plan of the palace smoke felt something touch the outermost of the protective spells something as light as a mosquitos weight as it lands before he could swing his attention to it it was gone and he was not sure he had not imagined it since the incident of the crows and bats he had been almost paranoid intuition told him he had reason there were forces at work that were way beyond him his best weapon was the fact that no one knew he existed he hoped he was a very frightened man these days terror lurked in every shadow he jumped and squeaked when the door opened smoke you startled me radisha where are they smoke theres been no word from swan have they gotten away leaving most of their people behind radisha be patient i have no patience left even my brother is becoming unsettled we have only weeks left before the rivers fall im aware of that madam concentrate on what you can do not what you wish you could do every force possible is being bent upon them but we cannot compel them to help the radisha kicked over a pile of books ive never felt so powerless i dont like the feeling smoke shrugged welcome to the world where the rest of us live in a high corner of the room a point no bigger than a pinprick oozed something like a black smoke the smoke slowly filled out the shape of a small crow what are the rest of them doing making preparations for war in case i wonder that black officer mogaba could he be the real captain no why hes doing the things i want them to do hes acting like theyre going to serve us it makes sense radisha if their captain comes back convinced they cant sneak away theyll be that much farther ahead has he made preparations to run back north of course the radisha looked vexed smoke smiled have you considered being forthright with them she gave him a look to chill the bones i thought not not the way of princes too simple too direct too logical too honest you grow too daring smoke perhaps i do though as i recall my mandate from your brother is to remind you occasionally enough they are what they pretend to be you know wholly ignorant of their past im aware of that it makes no difference they could become what they were if we let them sooner bend the knee to the shadowmasters than endure that again smoke shrugged as you will maybe he smiled slyly and as the shadowmasters will perhaps you know something i am constrained by my need to remain unnoticed but ive been able to catch glimpses of our northern friends they have fallen afoul of more of our little friends from the river ferocious things are happening down near the main sorcery high magnitude recalling that which manifested during their passage through the pirate swamps i no longer dare intrude damn damndamndamn are they all right have we lost them i no longer dare intrude time will tell the radisha kicked another pile of books smokes bland expression cracked became one of intense irritation she apologized its frustration were all frustrated perhaps you would be less so if you adjusted your ambitions what do you mean perhaps if you followed the course your brother has charted and aimed to climb but one mountain at a time bah am i a woman the only rooster around here you a woman will not be required to pay the price of failure that will come out of your brothers purse damn you smoke why are you always right that is my commission go to your brother talk recalculate concentrate on the enemy of the moment the shadowmasters must be turned now the priests will be here forever unless you want shut of them badly enough to let the shadowmasters win of course if i could frame just one high priest for treason all right i know the shadowmasters have shown they know what to do with clerics nobody would believe it im going if you dare find out whats happening down there if weve lost them well have to move quickly that damned swan had to go after them didnt he you sent him why does everybody do what i tell them some of the things i say are stupid get that grin off your face smoke failed kick over another stack of books the radisha huffed out of the room smoke sighed then he returned to his reading the books author lingered lovingly over impalements and flayings and tortures visited on a generation unlucky enough to have lived when the free companies of khatovar marched out of that strange corner of the world that spawned them the books in that room had been confiscated so they would not fall into the hands of the black company smoke did not believe their being there would keep secrets forever but maybe long enough for him to find a way to prevent the sort of bloodshed that had occurred in olden times maybe the best hope though lay in the probability that the company had mutated with time that it was not wearing a mask that it had indeed forgotten its grim origins and its search for its past was more a reflex than the determined return that other companies come back earlier had made in the back of smokes mind always was the temptation to take his own advice to bring the companys captain in and turn him loose on the books if only to see how he responded to the truth chapter thirty taglios aroused we approached taglios with the dawn days late all of us at the brink of collapse swan and his buddies maybe worse off than the rest their mundane mounts were wiped out i asked swan you figure the prahbrindrah will be overly pissed because i didnt keep my appointment swan still had a little pepper left what the hell can he do put a bug down your shirt hell swallow it and smile you worry about the woman shes the one wholl give you trouble if anybody does she dont always think right priests blade said yeah watch out for the priests they sprung this whole thing on them the day you guys landed they couldnt do anything but go along but they been thinking about it you can bet your butt and when they find them an angle theyre going to start messing whats blades thing with priests i dont know i dont want to know but i been down here long enough to start thinking hes maybe right the world might be better off if we drowned some of them one thing that made the military situation wonderfully impossible was the absence of fortifications taglios itself sprawled everywhere without a thought to defense a people with centuries of pacifism behind them an enemy with experienced armies and highpower sorcerers to support them and me with maybe a month to figure out how to help the former whip the latter impossible when those rivers went down so troops could cross the massacre would be on swan asked you make up your mind what youre going to do yeah the prahbrindrah isnt going to like it either that surprised him i did not explain let them worry i took my bunch in to the barracks and sent swan off to announce our return as we dismounted with half the company hanging around waiting to hear something murgen said i guess goblins made up his mind something had been preying on the little wizard he had been broody and curt all the way home now he was grinning he gave special attention to his saddlebags mogaba joined me weve made major progress while you were gone captain ill report when you feel up to it his question remained unspoken i saw no need to leave it hanging we cant sneak through theyve got us its fight or turn back then there is no option is there i guess there never was but i had to see for myself he nodded his understanding before business i tended wounds lady was coming back fast her bruises though did nothing to make her more attractive i felt odd examining her she had had little to say since our night in the rain she was doing a lot of thinking again mogaba had a lot to tell me about discussions with taglioss religious leaders and his ideas for putting together the pretense of an army i could find nothing in his suggestions i disapproved he said theres one other thing a priest named jahamaraj jah number two man in the shadar cult he has a daughter he thinks is dying it looks like a chance to make a friend or get somebody thoroughly pissed never underestimate the power of human ingratitude oneeye saw her i looked at the little witch doctor he said looked like her appendix to me croaker not that far gone yet either but these clowns around here dont have the foggiest theyre trying to exorcise demons i havent opened anybody up in years how long before it bursts another day at least unless shes unlucky i did what i could for the pain ill check it on the way back from the palace make me a map no youd better tag along you might be useful mogaba and i were getting dressed for a court appearance now lady was supposed to be doing the same swan not at all improved in appearance showed up to take us to the prince i did not feel like doing anything but take a nap i sure did not feel up to the games of politicians but i went the people of trogo taglios had heard that the moment of decision had come they were in the streets to watch us they remained eerily silent i saw dread in all those watching eyes but hope too they were aware of the risks and maybe even of the odds against them a pity they did not realize that a battlefield is not a wrestling ring once a child cried i shivered hoping it was not an omen as we neared the trogo an old man stepped out of the crowd and pressed something into my hand he bowed himself away it was a company badge from olden times an officers badge perhaps booty from some forgotten battle i fixed it near the badge i wore already the firebreathing deathshead of soulcatcher which we had retained though we no longer served the taken or the empire lady and i had outfitted ourselves in our finest meaning i wore my legates duds and she her imperial rig we impressed the mob beside us mogaba looked drab oneeye looked like a derelict scraped off the bottom of the worst dive in the worst slum that damned hat he was as happy as a snail showmanship lady had told me an old maxim of my own albeit directed somewhat differently in politics and battle our big weapon will have to be showmanship she was coming to life i think those brown guys pissed her off she was right showmanship and craft even more than traditionally would have to be our tools if we were to meet and beat the veteran armies commanded by the shadowmasters we would have to gain our triumphs inside the imaginations of enemy soldiers it takes ages to create a force with the selfconfidence to go slug it out despite the odds despite our being late the prahbrindrah drah was a gracious host he treated us to a dinner the likes of which i have no hope of seeing again afterward he laid on the entertainment dancing girls sword swallowers illusionists musicians whose work my ear found too alien to appreciate he was in no hurry to get to an answer of which he was confident during the afternoon swan introduced me to several score of taglioss leading men including jahamaraj jah i told jah i would look at his daughter as soon as i could the gratitude in the mans face was embarrassing otherwise i paid no attention to those men i had no intention of dealing with or through them the time came we were invited out of the crowd into a private chamber because i had brought two of my lieutenants the prahbrindrah did the same one was that codger smoke whom the prince introduced by title that translated out as lord of the guardians of public safety and that turned out to mean he was boss of the city fire brigade only oneeye failed to keep a straight face the prahbrindrahs other lieutenant was his enigmatic sister put them together and it was obvious she was older and probably tougher than he even dressed up she looked like she had been ridden hard and put away wet when the prahbrindrah asked about my companions i introduced mogaba as my commander of infantry and lady as my chief of staff the idea of a woman soldier amazed him i wondered how much more amazed he would be if he knew her history she concealed surprise at the designation as much for her benefit as the prahbrindrahs i said theres nobody in the company more qualified with the possible exception of the captain each post is filled on merit swan was doing the translating he skirted the edge of the prahbrindrahs reply which i think actually suggested limited agreement his sister seemed to be his brain trust to the point i told swan time is too tight if were going to stop an invasion swan smiled then youre going to accept the commission you never doubted it for a second you jackal dont get your hopes too high man im going to make a counteroffer its terms wont be negotiable swans smile vanished i dont understand ive looked at the land ive talked with my people despite the lay most of them want to go on we know what we have to do to get to khatovar meaning well consider doing the job your prince wants done but we wont try it except on our terms tell him that then ill give him the sad news swan translated the prahbrindrah did not look happy his sister looked like she wanted a fight swan faced me lets have it if im supposed to run an army that ill have to build from scratch i want to have the power to do it i want to be the boss no interference from anybody no political crap no cult feuding even the will of the prince will have to yield for the duration i dont know if theres a taglian word for what i want i cant think of a rosean word either in the jewel cities the man in the job i want is called dictator they elect him for a year at a time tell him that was the prahbrindrah happy sure he was about as happy as any prince in that fix he started lawyering trying to bury me in ifs ands and buts i smiled a lot i said i wouldnt negotiate swan i meant it the only chance i see is for us to do what needs doing when its got to be done not six weeks later after the ruffled feathers have been smoothed the special interests have had their say and the graft has been got out mogaba had on the biggest smile id ever seen from him he was having fun listening maybe hed always wanted to talk that way to his bosses in geaxle i said the way i hear it in about five weeks the rivers will be down enough that the shadowmasters can put their troops across the main they wont have internal problems slowing them down theyll have every advantage but the black company on their side so if the prahbrindrah wants even a prayer of winning he has to give me the tools i need if he doesnt i walk i find some other way i wont commit suicide swan translated we sat around looking tough and professional and stubborn lady and mogaba did fine i thought i might blow it by being nervous but i did not the prahbrindrah never tried to call my bluff he argued but never so hard i might lose my temper and stomp out i never gave an inch i honestly believed that the only chance and that a ghost of a hope lay in an absolute military dictatorship and i had a little inside word thanks to frogface hey swan are these people in even bigger trouble than theyve admitted what he cast a nervous glance at the imp your boss isnt trying to talk me out of anything hes lawyering politicking wasting time i get the feeling that down deep hes scared to death he agrees with me only he dont want to have to make the choice between evils because then he has to live with his choice yeah maybe the shadowmasters are going to be coming mean after what we did last summer going to make an example of us maybe ill want the veterans of that business well turn them into squad leaders assuming i get to be boss soldier around here there is an archaic taglian word meaning warlord youll get your way its been argued out in council the high priests dont like it but they dont have any choice priests were the first people the shadowmasters rubbed out wherever they took over he can make any deal he has to theyre scared man after you win is when you got to start worrying all i had to do was go on sitting tight but i had come into the meeting with that assurance from frogface the damned imp grinned and winked at me the day rolled on into night and we had to have another meal but we sealed our pact for the first time since juniper the company had a real commission or vice versa the prahbrindrah wanted to know my plans he was not dumb he knew mogaba had been putting in twentyhour days put together a big flashy show for the gang that comes across the main mostly but well recruit and train for harder times down the line too assuming we handle that first bunch while were at it well get an idea of what resources are available and how best to employ them well root out enemy agents here and try to establish our own over there well learn the terrain where the fighting may take place swan i keep hearing about how little time we have till the rivers go down how long will they stay down how long till the next grace period he translated then said therell be six to seven months when there wont be enough rain to close the fords even after the rainy season starts therell be two or three months when theyre passable part of the time wonderful we got here in the middle of the safe season just about we could get more than five weeks thats a worst estimate we can count on it then tell him well need a lot of help from the state we have to have weapons armor mounts rations drays drayage equipment we need a census of all males between sixteen and fortyfive with their skills and occupations i want to know who to conscript if i dont get volunteers a census of animals would be helpful likewise a census of weapons and equipment available and a census of fortifications and places that could be used as fortresses you should know a lot of this from last summer do you write the lingo here swan he translated then said no i cant figure out the alphabet course i never learned to read or write rosean neither he grinned not cordy neither blade you kidding wonderful find me somebody who can its all right if hes one of the radishas spies two birds with one stone ill want you and him both attached to me at the hip till i learn the language all right what i need right now is for him to get out the word that volunteers should assemble in the chandri square an hour after dawn tomorrow the chandri square was near our barracks and one of the biggest in taglios they should bring any weapons or equipment they have well pick twentyfive hundred to start training immediately and enroll the rest for later you may be too optimistic i thought these people were eager to get into it they are but tomorrow is a holy day for the gunni cults that takes in fourtenths of the lower classes when they sit down nobody else can do anything either there arent any holidays in a war they better get used to that right now they dont show up thats tough they get left behind tell the prince to spread the word that the guys who volunteer earliest are the guys whore going to get the best deal but everybody starts at the bottom even him if he enlists i dont know the class structures here and i dont care ill make a prince carry a spear and have a farm boy command a legion if thats what the man can do best that attitudes going to cause problems cap and even if they elect you god youre going to have to walk careful around the priests ill deal with them when i have to the politics i can probably handle i can twist arms and smooth fur if i have to though mainly i just wont put up with it tell the prince he should hang around my headquarters some things will go smoother if people think hes part of whats happening swan and the prince chattered the radisha gave me a searching look then a smile that said she knew what i was up to the devil in me made me wink her smile broadened i decided i should know more about her not because i was attracted to her but because i suspected i would like the way she thought i like a person with a sound cynical attitude old smoke the socalled fire chief did nothing all evening but nod off and start awake being a cynic i approved of him as a public official the best kind are those who stay the hell out of the way and dont mess with things except for me of course one thing left for tonight i told swan financing the black company dont come cheap neither does creating arming training and maintaining an army swan grinned they got you covered cap back when they first heard the prophecies of your coming they started raising money it wont be a problem its always a problem he smiled you wont be able to spend like there aint no bottom to the bucket the woman hangs on to the purse strings around here and shes famous for being tight good enough ask the prince if theres anything else he needs now ive got a ton of stuff to do there was another hour of talk none of it important all of it the prahbrindrah and radisha trying to get an idea what i was planning trying to get a clearer picture of my character and competence giving a stranger lifeanddeath power over their state was one long bet for them i figured id do a little something to help their underground scheme i became impatience itself but was proud of me i controlled it walking home after dark without crowds i asked lady can we count on shifters help hell do what i tell him youre sure not absolutely it looks that way though could he do some scouting over shadowmaster country shifting into something that flies maybe she smiled but he wouldnt have strength enough to carry you and i know you you wouldnt trust a report from anybody but you well youll have to take your chances trust him as much as you dare hell serve me if i command him but he isnt my slave he has his own goals now they may not be your goals i thought it might be a good time to sneak up on something id been sliding around since id caught her playing with fire in a cup overlooking geaxle and your own restored talent she was not fazed youre kidding i might bother goblin if i sneaked up on him and hit him with a hammer otherwise im useless even small talents have to be exercised to be any good theres no time for exercise i guess well all just do what we can mogaba said i have several ideas for disarming problems arising from religious friction at least temporarily speaking of which i need to carve on that priests kid oneeye ill need you to back me up go ahead mogaba his notion was straightforward we would raise our own army without regard to religion and use it to meet the shadowmasters main thrust we would encourage the cults to raise their own forces and use them to meet threats that appeared at the secondary fords but we would not surrender our claim to supreme command i laughed i have a feeling youre looking for a repeat of the debacle of last summer when nothing should disarm them more thoroughly than failures and displays of incompetence i thought we ought to give them their chances sounds good to me work up a couple of questions for recruits so we can get the drift of their religious commitment and tolerance when we sign them up you want to tell me how to find this guy jahamaraj jah chapter thirtyone taglios a bootcamp city it had been years since i hazarded internal surgery before i started i was shaky and filled with doubts but habit took hold in the crunch my hand was steady oneeye restrained his natural exuberance and used his talents judiciously to control bleeding and deaden pain as i washed my hands i said i cant believe it went that well i havent done one of those since i was a kid practically she going to pull through oneeye asked should unless therere complications i want you to check back every day to make sure shes doing all right hey croaker i got me an idea why dont you buy me a broom what when i wasnt busy doing anything else i could be sweeping up ill get myself one too i spoke to the childs parents briefly through frogface clueing them in on what had to be done their gratitude was stifling i doubted it would last people are that way but as we were about to leave i told the father ill collect on this anything it wont be trivial when the time comes he understood he looked grim as he nodded we were about to step into the street when oneeye said hold up he pointed i looked down at three dead bats arranged in a neat equilateral triangle maybe the boys arent imagining things the bat cadavers were not neat a crow cawed somewhere nearby i muttered ill take my help where i can get it louder could you make a bat spy on people oneeye thought about it i couldnt but it might be possible though they arent long on brains thats all i needed to know except for who was running the bats the shadowmasters i presumed the twentyhour days started when i was not preoccupied with anything else i tried to learn the language after you have learned enough they come easy or easier anyway we went at it trying to keep things simple all the evidence indicated that the shadowmasters would use the ghoja ford for their main crossing i abdicated the defense of the others to the cult leaders and concentrated on what i thought id need to stop that main force in its tracks if it got across the river and started rolling north i feared we would have a repeat of swans campaign any victory at all would be at a price too dear i started by forming the cadres of two legions based on the model used by the jewel cities in early times when their armies were citizens with little field experience the command structure was the simplest possible the organization was pure infantry mogaba was overall commander of the foot and boss of the first legion his lieutenant ochiba got the second legion each got to keep ten nar for ncos and each of those ten picked a hundred candidates from among the taglian volunteers that gave each legion a thousandman base which would be expanded about as fast as the nar could teach them to march in a straight line mogaba got wheezer lion and heart for staff work i did not know what else to do with those three they were willing but had little practical value sindawe and the remaining nar were to form a third training and reserve legion that i expected to employ only in desperation otto hagop the guards and the roi i charged with putting together a cavalry force sparkle candles cletus and the rest from opal and beryl got stuck with the fun stuff quartermastering and engineering hagops nephew ended up with him he was another one who was useless the ideas were mostly mogabas recommendations which he had worked out while i was scouting southward i did not agree with all of them but it seemed a sin to waste the work he had done and we had to move in some direction now he had it all figured sindawes legion would both produce new people for the leading two units and would develop as a force itself more slowly he did not believe we could manage a force larger than three legions till we developed a lot of local talent lady goblin oneeye and i were left to handle everything else the important exciting stuff like dealing with the prahbrindrah and his sister like setting up an intelligence operation finding out if there were any local wizards we could use charting strategy coming up with gimmicks good old mogaba was willing to leave me the staff work and strategy actually about the way it should be the man embarrassed me with his competence goblin i guess you should take counterintelligence i said har oneeye said that fits him perfectly borrow frogface whenever you need him the imp moaned he got no pleasure out of having to work goblin put on a smug look i dont need that thing croaker i did not like that the runt was up to something ever since we came back from the country he had had that smugness about him it meant trouble he and oneeye could get so involved in their feud they forgot the rest of the world time would tell what was up whatever you say i told goblin as long as you get the job done dangerous agents of the shadowmasters i want you to take out smalltimers set up so we can feed them false information weve also got to keep one eye on the big priests theyre bound to give us grief as soon as they figure out how human nature lady i put in charge of showmanship and planning i had decided where i wanted to meet the enemy already before i had anything to meet him with i told her to work out the details she was a better tactician than i she had managed the armies of an empire with astonishing success i was learning that part of a captains job is to delegate maybe genius lies in choosing the right person for the right task we had maybe five weeks and the time was counting down and down and down i did not think we had a prayer nobody got much sleep everybody got testy but that is the way it is in our business you learn to adjust to it to understand mogaba kept telling me it was going great on his end but i never got time to review his outfits hagop and otto were less pleased with their progress their recruits were of classes that saw discipline as something imposed only upon their inferiors otto and hagop had to resort to asskicking to get their people in line they came up with a couple of interesting ideas like adding elephants to the cavalry the prahbrindrahs census of animals had turned up a few hundred work elephants i spent my time rushing around in confusion more often a politician than a commander i avoided recourse to dictate when i could preferring persuasion but two of the high priests gave me no choice most of the time if i said black they said white just to let me know they considered themselves taglioss real bosses if id had time id have gotten vexed with them i didnt so i didnt play their games i got them and their chief boys together with the prahbrindrah and his sister chaperoning and told them i didnt care for their attitude that i would not tolerate it and the schedule from here on in was do it croakers way or die if they didnt like that they were welcome to take their best crack at me then i would roast them over a slow fire in one of the public squares i did not make myself popular i was bluffing sort of i would do what had to be done but did not expect to have to do it my apparently violent nature should cow them while i got on with the job i would worry about them after id turned the shadowmasters thinking positive all the time thats me id have starved if id gotten a pound of bread for every minute i really believed we had a chance several people made sure news of the faceoff got out i heard rumors that some temples closed their doors for lack of business others had to turn away angry crowds great but how long would it last these peoples passion for supernatural nonsense was far older and more ingrained than their passion for militarism what the hell happened i asked swan first chance i got i was getting the language but not fast enough to grasp religious subtleties i think blade happened he seemed bemused say what ever since weve been here blades been spreading seditious nonsense about priests should stick to taking care of souls and karma and keep their noses out of politics been selling that down to our place and when he heard about your confab with the high priests he got himself out in the streets to spread what he called the true story these people are all for their gods you better remember that but they aint so hot on some of their priests especially the kind that grab them by the purse and squeeze i laughed then i said you tell him to back off ive got troubles enough without a religious revolution right i dont think you got to worry about that i had to worry about everything taglian society was under extreme stress though it took an outsider to see it too many changes too fast in a traditionalist restrictive society no way for conventional mechanisms to adjust saving taglios would be like riding the whirlwind i would have to stay light on my feet to keep the frustration and fear directed against the shadowmasters oneeye wakened me in the middle of one of my fourhour snoozes jahamaraj jah is here says hes got to see you right now his kid take a turn for the worse shes fine he thinks hes going to pay you off bring him in the priest slipped in looking furtive he bowed and scraped like a street dweller he plied me with every title the taglian people had been able to imagine including healer appendectomy was a piece of surgery unknown in those parts he looked around as though expecting ears growing out of the walls maybe that was an occupational hazard he did not like the sight of frogface at all that suggested some people knew what the imp was i should keep that in mind is it safe to talk he asked i followed that without translation yes i must not stay long they will be watching me knowing i owe you a great debt healer then get on with it i thought yes the high priest of the shadar my superior ghojarindi ghoj whose patron is hada one of whose avatars is death you distressed him the other night he has told the children of hada that hada thirsts for your ka frogface translated and added commentary hada is the shadar goddess of death destruction and corruption cap the children of hada are a subcult who dedicate themselves by way of murder and torture doctrine says that should be random and senseless the way it works out though is that those who die have got onto the boss priests shitlist i see i smiled slightly and who is your patron jahamaraj jah he smiled back khadi all sweetness and light i take it hell no chief shes hadas twin sister just as damned nasty got her fingers into plague famine disease fun stuff like that one of the big things the shadar and gunni cults squabble about is whether hada and khadi are separate deities or just one with two faces i love it i bet people get killed over it and priests look at me weird when i say i cant take them seriously oneeye you figure im guessing right when i think our buddy here is helping himself by trying to weasel out of a debt oneeye chuckled i figure he plans to be the next shadar boss i had frogface go straight at him he did not blush he admitted he was the most likely successor to ghojarindi ghoj in that case i dont figure hes done anything but make the vig tell him thanks but i figure he still owes me tell him that if he all of a sudden finds himself boss priest of the shadar id be real proud if hed make his people mind and not get too ambitious himself for a year or two frogface told him his grin went away his lips tightened into a wrinkly little nut but he bobbed his head get him on the road oneeye wouldnt want him getting in trouble with his boss i went and wakened goblin we got priest problems character named ghojarindi ghoj is siccing assassins on me take murgen go over to swans dive dig out his resident priest hater have him finger the guy he needs promoting to a higher plane it dont have to be spectacular just unpleasant like having him shit himself to death grumbling goblin went to find murgen oneeye and frogface got to watch for wouldbe assassins they were professionals but they were not up to getting past frogface there were six of them i had some of the nar who favored that sort of thing take them to a public square and impale them ghojarindi ghoj went west a day later he perished of a sudden dramatic surfeit of boils the lesson was not lost on anyone the lesson was of course dont get caught nobody seemed upset or displeased the attitude was ghoj had placed his bets and taken his chances but the radisha did give me some thoughtful looks while we fussed over whether i needed another thousand swords and especially if i needed the hundred tons of charcoal i had requisitioned actually we were to the gamesplaying stage already i asked for a hundred tons knowing i wanted ten figuring to groan and gripe and give in and get more of the arms the recruits were providing their own kit the arms i most wanted financed by the state were pieces that could not be well explained to a civilian i was having trouble enough convincing mogaba that wheeled light artillery might be of value i was not sure it would myself that depended on what the enemy did if they behaved as they had before artillery would be wasted but the model was the jewel cities legion those guys dragged light engines along to knock holes in enemy formations oh fuss some things you just settle by saying im the boss and youll do it my way mogaba did not mind seventeen days to go estimated lady visited me i asked her will you be ready im almost ready now one positive report amongst the hundreds you brighten my life she gave me a funny look ive seen shifter hes been across the river oneeye and goblin in their capacities as spymasters had had little luck mostly because the main was just plain uncrossable they had no lack of volunteers as for cleaning up the shadowmasters agents in taglios that had not taken them ten days a bunch of little brown guys had bitten the dust a few native taglians remained we were feeding them plenty of truth and just enough bull to tempt their masters into making their major crossing effort where i wanted it ah and did he learn anything we want to hear she grinned he did you get your wish theyll bring their main force over at the ghoja ford and they wont be with their armies they dont trust each other enough to leave home base unguarded beautiful suddenly i feel like weve got a chance maybe only one in ten but a chance and now for the bad news i guess it had to be what is it theyre sending an extra five thousand men ten thousand in the ghoja force a thousand each at theri and vehdnabota the rest come across at numa they tell me numa is crossable two days earlier than the ghoja ford is thats bad they could have three thousand guys behind us when it hits they will unless theyre morons i closed my eyes and looked at the map numa was where i had told jahamaraj jah his shadar people could make their mark he had raised twentyfive hundred cultists only by straining most shadars wanted to wait and get into our ecumenical force three thousand veterans would roll right over him cavalry i asked have jah meet them at the waters edge and do what he can and fall back and have our cavalry hit them from the flank as theyre about to break out i was considering sneaking mogabas legion down smash them then rout march to ghoja but youre right cavalry would be more efficient do you trust otto and hagop to handle it i did not they were having their problems taking charge without the bloodyminded roi to kick ass where that was needed their force would have been a travelling circus you want it you done a field command she looked at me hard where have you been right id been there often enough you want it if you want me to take it singe me to a crisp in the fire of your enthusiasm all right but we wont tell anybody till its time and jahamaraj jah not at all hell try harder if he dont know help is coming all right any other news from our seldomseen friend no who is that woman hes dragging around she hesitated a moment too long i dont know odd seems like ive seen her somewhere before but i cant place her she shrugged after a while everybody gets to look like somebody youve seen before who do i look like she didnt miss a beat gastrar telsar of novok debraken the voice is different but the heart could be the same he moralized and debated with himself too how could i argue id never heard of the guy he moralized once too often my husband had him flayed you think i moralized about ghoj yes i think you put yourself through hell after the fact a net gain youve gotten smart enough to get them first and cry later i dont think i want to play this game no you wouldnt i need some of your time for tailors to take your measurements say what i got me a flashy uniform already not like this one this one is for boggling the minions of the shadowmasters part of the showmanship right whenever i can work while im being measured is shifter going to be there for the show at ghoja well find out the hard way he didnt say i told you he has his own agenda wouldnt mind having a peek at that he give you one no mogaba is staging a mock battle between legions today you going no im going to be sucking up to the radisha for more transport i got the charcoal now i got to get it down there she snorted things were different in my time you had more power thats true ill send the tailors and fitters i wondered what she had in mind what did i see that what was that did she shake her tail as she was going out damn me my eyes must be starting to go weekly assessment session i asked murgen hows the bat situation what i had caught him from the blind side you brought the bat problem up i thought you were keeping track i havent seen any for a while good that means goblin and oneeye got the right people out of the way from where i sit everything looks like its going smooth probably faster than we had reason to expect id had no individual complaints for a while lady had found time to help otto and hagop put the fear into their snooty horsemen mogaba twelve days left on the worstcase estimate its time to put teams out to watch the river stages worst case might not be absolutely worst the radisha is ahead of you i talked to her yesterday shed just grabbed off half the post riders for that right now the river is running higher than expected that may not mean anything well have plenty of weather yet every day we get is another hundred men i can take into each legion where are you at now thirtythree hundred each ill stop at four thousand be time to move out then anyway think five days is enough to get down there thats twenty miles a day for guys who arent used to it theyll be used to it they do ten a day with field pack now ill get out to look them over this week promise ive got the political end pretty well whipped hagop you guys going to be ready its coming together croaker theyve started to realize we mean it when we say were trying to show them how to stay alive its getting close enough that they have to think about it as more than a game big bucket how about you guys get us fifty more wagons and we can roll tomorrow captain you look at the sketches of that town yes sir how long to set it up depends on materials for the palisade and manpower lot of trenching the rest no problem youll have the manpower sindawes bunch theyll go down with you and move on later as our reserve ill tell you though the resource situation is bleak youll end up depending on the trench more than the palisade cletus what about artillery cletus and his brothers grinned they looked proud of themselves we got it six mobile engines for each legion already built were working the crews on them now great i want you to go down with the quartermasters and engineers and get a look at that town put some of the engines in there big bucket you guys better head out as soon as you can the roads are going to be miserable if you really need more wagons mooch them from the citizens be quicker than me trying to gouge them out of the radisha so cant anybody come up with anything i can fuss myself about you know im not happy unless im worrying they looked at me blankly finally murgen blurted out were going to meet their ten thousand with our eight isnt that worry enough sir ten thousand thats the rumor that the shadowmasters increased the invasion force i glanced at lady she shrugged i said we have unreliable intelligence to that effect but well be more than eight thousand with the cavalry with sindawe well actually outnumber them well have the field position and i have a trick or two up my sleeve that charcoal mogaba asked among other things you wont tell us nope word has a way of getting around if nobody but me knows i cant blame anybody but me if the other side finds out mogaba smiled he understood me too well i just wanted to keep it for myself we commanders are that way sometimes my predecessors never told anybody anything till it was time to jump afterward i asked lady what do you think i think theyre going to know they were in a fight i still have grave doubts about winning but maybe youre a better captain than you want to admit you put every man where he can do the most good or least harm wheezer and hagops nephew still had not shown me they were good for anything seven days till deadline the quartermasters and engineers and sindawes reserve legion were two days gone incoming post riders reported their progress as disappointing the roads were hopeless but they were getting help from people along the way in places the troops and locals backpacked the freight while the teams dragged the empty wagons through the mud we were going to get some grace we were still getting drizzle when that should have ended a week ago reports had the fords way too high to cross the watchers guessed we had at least five extra days i told mogaba who needed time more than anyone else he grumbled that his main accomplishment to date was that he had taught his troops to march in straight lines i thought that was the critical lesson if they could maintain order on the battlefield i was not comfortable with the gift of time as each day perished in turn and i had more reports of the trouble the advance party was having i grew ever more antsy two days before our originally planned departure i summoned mogaba have you relaxed any because of the extra time no not easing up at all no if we leave five days later theyll be five days more prepared good i leaned back in my chair youre troubled that mud i had frogface go scout sindawe is still twenty miles from vejagedhya whatll it be like for the mob well take down he nodded youre thinking of leaving early im seriously considering leaving when we originally planned just to make sure if were there early we can get rested and maybe a little more trained under field conditions he nodded again then took me by surprise you play hunches sometimes dont you i lifted an eyebrow ive watched you since geaxle im beginning to understand how your mind works i think and sometimes i think you dont understand yourself well enough youve been troubled all week that is a sign you have a hunch trying to come through he left his chair ill proceed on the assumption that youll leave early he left i thought about him knowing how my mind works should i feel flattered or threatened i went to a window opened it looked at the night sky i saw stars between racing clouds maybe the cycle of daily drizzle was over or maybe it was just another pause i went back to work my current project taken catchascatchcan was one i was working on with frogface we were trying to figure out what had become of the books missing from all the libraries around town i had an idea that a certain anonymous official had them squirreled away in the prahbrindrahs palace the question was how to get to them invoke my powers as dictator ignore the river say what i looked around what the hell ignore the river a crow stood on the windowsill another settled beside it it delivered the same message crows are smart but only for bird brains i asked what they were talking about they told me to ignore the river i could put them on the rack and they would not tell me more all right i got it ignore the river shoo crows all the time with the damned crows they were trying to tell me something sure what they had warned me before were they saying i should pay no attention to the river stages that was my inclination anyway because of the mud i went to the door and yelled oneeye goblin i need you they mustered in looking surly standing well away from one another not a good sign they were feuding again or working up to it it had been so long since they had eased the pressure that it might be a major blowup tonights the night guys take out the rest of the shadowmasters agents i thought we had some extra time oneeye carped we might have and we might not i want it done now take care of it under his breath goblin muttered yessir your dictatorship sir i gave him a dirty look he moved out i went to the window and stared out at that clearing sky i had a feeling things were going too good chapter thirtytwo shadowlight the shadowmasters met in a haste that left them exhausted the meet had been set days earlier but as they travelled a cry had gone out saying it was too late for lazy comfortable movements they were in the place of the pool and uncertain dimensions and shadows the woman bobbed restlessly her companion was agitated the one who spoke seldom spoke first what is the panic our resources in taglios have been exterminated all but the newest as suddenly as that she snapped her fingers her companion said they are about to march the woman they knew who our resources were which means everything we learned through them is suspect her companion we have to move sooner than we planned we cannot give them a minute more than we must the quiet one asked have we been found out the woman no we have the one resource close to the heart still undetected if mostly ineffective it hasnt reported a hint of a suspicion we should join the troops we should leave nothing to the hazard of battle weve argued this out already no we will not risk ourselves there is no cause to think they will have any chance against our veterans i have added five thousand men to the invasion force that is enough there was another thing the thing you called us here to present yes our comrade of shadowcatch and overlook is not as southward obsessed as he would have us think he infiltrated some of his people into taglian territory the past year they attacked the leaders of the black company and failed abysmally their efforts served only one purpose beyond betraying his thinking they gave me a chance to insinuate our one surviving resource into the enemy fold then when next we meet him we can mock him in turn perhaps if it seems appropriate one piece of news comes out of his effort dorotea senjak is with them a long stillness followed finally the one who spoke so seldom observed that alone explains why our friend would send men north secretly how dearly he would love to own her the female replied for more reasons than the obvious there appears to be a relationship with the companys captain she would be a valuable resource if that relationship is strong enough to be manipulated she must be killed as soon as possible no we must capture her if he can use her so can we think what she knows what she was she might hold the key to ridding the world of him and of closing the gateway she may be powerless but she has not lost her memory the one who spoke seldom began to laugh his laughter was as insane as that heard in overlook he was thinking anyone could use the memories of dorotea senjak anyone the female recognized that laugh understood what was happening in his mind knew she and her companion would have to proceed very carefully but she pretended not to see she asked her companion have you contacted the one in the swamps he wants nothing to do with us or our troubles he is content with his fetid humid little empire but he will come around good were agreed we advance the schedule heads nodded i will send the orders immediately chapter thirtythree taglios drunken wizards it had not been a good day it got no better because the sun went down the high had been frogface reporting sindawe reaching vejagedhya the low followed immediately there was no material to fortify the town a ditch would be it but the ground was so sodden the walls of a ditch would keep collapsing oh well if the gods were out to get us they were out to get us all our wriggling on the hook wouldnt change a thing i was ready to collapse into bed when murgen burst in i was so tired i was seeing double two of him did not improve the state of the universe what now i snapped maybe big trouble goblin and oneeye are down at swans place drunk on their asses and theyve started in i dont like the smell of it i got up resigned to another sleepless night it had been a long time brewing it might get out of hand what are they doing just the usual so far but theres no fun in it this time theres an undercurrent of viciousness anyway it stinks like somebody could get hurt horses ready i sent word i grabbed up the officers baton some nar had tossed me as we had approached geaxle no special reason other than that it was the nearest thing handy for thumping heads the barracks was quiet as we passed through the men sensed something afoot by the time i reached the stables mogaba and lady had joined the parade murgen explained while they cursed our taglian stablehands into readying two more horses that the feud had gotten out of hand was obvious from blocks away fires illuminated the night taglians were coming out to see what was happening the wizards had squared off in the street outside swans place that had been gutted fires flickered up and down the street none major just patches gnawing the faces of buildings evidence of the errant aim of a couple of drunken sorcerers those troublesome little shits were having difficulty standing let alone shooting straight so maybe the gods do watch out for fools and drunks had they been sober they would have murdered each other unconscious bodies lay scattered around swan and mather and blade and several guys from the company were among them they had tried to break it up and gotten creamed for their trouble oneeye and goblin were escalating oneeye had a painedlooking frogface sicced on goblin goblin had something that looked like a black snake of smoke growing out of his belt pouch it was trying to get past frogface when the things grappled a shower of light washed the street revealing taglians crouched watching from relative safety i halted before they noticed me lady whats that thing goblins got cant tell from here something he shouldnt a match for frogface which i would have thought was out of oneeyes class she sounded vaguely troubled there were times id had that notion myself it did not seem reasonable that you could walk into a shop and buy a frogface off the shelf but it hadnt bothered oneeye and he was the expert frogface and the snake came to grips midway between their masters they started grunting and straining and screaming and thumping around i wondered aloud is that what goblin brought back from the country what from the first time i saw him after his setto with the brown guys directing the shadows he had this smugness about him like he finally had him some way to whip the world lady thought if he picked it up from the shadowmasters men it could be a plant shifter could tell us for sure he aint here lets make the assumption the last fire burned itself out goblin and oneeye were totally preoccupied oneeye stumbled over his own bootlace for a moment it looked like goblin would get the upper hand frogface barely turned the snakes strike enough we cant do without them much as id like to bury them both and have done with their crap i spurred my horse goblin was nearest me he barely started to turn i leaned down and thumped his head i did not see the result i was on oneeye already i whacked him up side the head too i turned for a second charge but lady mogaba and murgen had them wrapped up the battle between frogface and the snake died out but they did not they eyed one another across ten feet of pavement i swung down frogface can you talk or are you as crazy as your boss hes crazy cap not me but i got an indenture i got to do what he says yeah tell me this whats that thing growing out of goblins pouch a kind of imp in another form whered he come up with it cap i wonder myself murgen check these other guys out see if weve got any real casualties mogaba drag that little shit over here im going to knock some heads together we plunked them down side by side with lady and mogaba holding them sitting from behind they began to come around murgen came to tell me none of the unconscious men were injured that was something oneeye and goblin looked up at me i paced back and forth smacking the baton into my hand my dictators stalk i whirled on them next time this happens im going to tie you two into a sack facetoface and drop you in the river i dont have the patience for it tomorrow while your hangovers are still killing you youre going to get up and come down here and make good fhe damage the expense will come out of your pockets do you understand goblin looked a little sheepish he managed a feeble nod oneeye did not respond oneeye you want another whack up side the head he nodded sullenly good now goblin that thing you brought back from the country chances are it belongs to the shadowmasters a plant before you go to bed i want it stuffed in a bottle or something and buried deep his eyes bugged croaker you heard me an angry almost roaring hiss filled the street the snake thing came up off the paving and struck at me frogface flung in from the side deflecting it in a sudden drunken bugeyed panic goblin and oneeye both tried to get it under control i backed off it was a wild three minutes before goblin got it squished into his pouch he stumbled into swans place a minute later he came out carrying a closed wine jar he looked at me funny ill bury it croaker he sounded embarrassed oneeye was getting himself together too he took a deep breath ill give him a hand right try not to talk too much dont get started again he had the grace to look embarrassed too he gave frogface a thoughtful look i noted that he did not take the imp along to do the heavy work what now mogaba asked pains me all to hell but now we count on their consciences to keep them in line for a while if i didnt need them so much id make it a night theyd remember the rest of their lives i dont need this shit whatre you grinning about lady did not stop its smaller scale but this is what it was like trying to keep a rein on the ten who were taken yeah maybe so murgen you were out here boozing anyway you finish picking up the pieces im going to get some sleep chapter thirtyfour to ghoja it was worse than i thought it would be the mud seemed bottomless the first day out of taglios after a cheering parade we made twelve miles i did not feel desperate but the road was better nearer the city after that it got worse eleven miles the next day nine each of the three days following we made that good a time only because we had the elephants along the day i wanted to reach the ghoja ford i was still thirty miles away then shifter came wearing his wolf shape prancing in out of the wilds the rains had ended but the sky remained overcast so the ground did not dry the sun was no ally shifter came with a smaller companion it looked as though his understudy had caught on to shifting he spent an hour with lady before we moved out then he galloped away again lady did not look cheerful bad news the worst theyve put one over on us maybe i did not betray the sudden tightness in my innards what recall the map of the main between numa and ghoja theres that low area that floods i pictured it for twelve miles the river ran through an area flanked by plains that flooded whenever the river rose more than a few feet at its highest stage it could be fourteen miles wide there with most of the flooding on the southern side that plain became a huge reservoir and was the reason the numa ford became crossable before the ghoja but the last id heard it was mostly drained i know it what about it ever since they took the south bank the shadowmasters have been building a levee from the downriver end right along the normal bank its something thats been talked about for ages the prahbrindrah wanted to do it to claim the plain for farming but he couldnt afford the labor the shadowmasters dont have that problem they have fifty thousand prisoners on it taglians who didnt get across the river last year and enemies from their old territories no ones paid any attention because the project is one of those things that anyone who could would do but but theyve gotten the levee run out eight miles to the east thats not as huge a deal as it sounds because it only needs to be about ten feet tall every half mile they put in a larger filled area maybe a hundred fifty yards to a side like towers along a wall they keep the prisoners camped there and use the platforms for materials dumps i dont see where youre going shifter noticed that theyd stopped extending the levee but they were still stockpiling materials then he figured it out theyre going to dam the river partially just enough to divert water into the flood plain so they can drop the level at the ghoja ford sooner than we expect i thought about it it was a cunning bit of business and entirely practical the company had done a trick or two with rivers in its time all it had to do was give them a day if they got across unchallenged we were sunk the sneaky bastards can we get there in time maybe even probably considering you didnt wait to leave taglios but at the rate were going itll be just barely in time and well be worn out from fighting the mud have they started damming yet they start that this morning shifter says it should take them two days to get the fill in and one more to divert enough water will it affect numa not for a week the water will keep dropping there for now shifters guess is theyll cross at numa the day before they do at ghoja we looked at each other she saw what i saw the shadowmasters had robbed us of what we had in mind for the night before ghoja damn them i know this mud being what it is ill have to leave today to get there in time i probably wont get back to ghoja use sindawe in our place that town is a waste anyway ill have to move faster somehow abandon the wagons but leave the engineers and quartermasters behind let them make the best time they can ill leave them the elephants theyre no good to me anyway have each man carry a little extra whatever is most practical even the wagons might get there in time if they skip stopping at vejagehdya youre right lets get at it i gathered my people and explained what we were going to do an hour later i watched lady and the cavalry file away to the southeast mogabas grumbling infantrymen each carrying an extra fifteen pounds started slogging toward ghoja even the old warlord carried a load i was glad i had had the luck or foresight to send out the bulk of the stuff several days early i walked with the rest of them my horse was carrying two hundred pounds of junk and looking humiliated by the experience oneeye grumbled along beside me he had frogface out scouting for lines of advance where the earth would least resist our passage i kept one eye on lady i felt hollow empty wed both come to think of the night before the ghoja battle as the night and now that would not be i suspected it would never be there would always be something to stand in the way maybe there were gods who frowned on our admitting and consummating what we felt inside a pox on them and all their illegitimate children someday damnit someday but what then then we would have to give up a lot of pretense then wed have to face some things decide some things examine the possibilities and implications of some commitments i did not spend a lot of time thinking about saving taglios that day chapter thirtyfive before ghoja take some ground and sog it real good all the way down to the earths core bake it under a warm sun a few days what do you get bugs they rose in clouds as i slithered to the crest overlooking the ghoja ford the mosquitoes wanted to feed the smaller guys just wanted to pitch camp in my nose the grass had grown since last time it was two feet tall now i slid my sword forward and parted it mogaba sindawe ochiba goblin and oneeye did the same big mob over there oneeye said we had known that beforehand we could smell their campfires my own troops were eating cold if those guys over there didnt know we were here yet i wasnt going to yell and let them in on it mob was an operative word that bunch was undisciplined and disorderly camped in a sprawl that began at the fortress gate and stretched back south along the road what you think mogaba unless thats show to fool us we have a chance if we keep them that side of the crest he inched forward looked at the ground youre sure you want me on the left im assuming your legion is more ready put ochibas on the right up the steeper ground the natural tendency of an attack would be to push the direction that looks easiest mogaba grunted if they push either one of you much without pushing the other they open themselves up to heavier enfilading and quartering fire if the artillery gets here im going to plant some here and the rest down on that little hump there have them going both ways long as the hinge holds the join between legions would be at the road that split the field should be good hunting for archers and javelins too mogaba grumbled plans are mayflies when the steel begins to sing i rolled onto my side looked at him directly will the nar stand fast his cheek twitched he knew what i meant except for the thing on the river which was a whole different show mogabas men had seen no real combat i hadnt found out till recently their ancestors had gotten geaxle and its neighbors so tamed they just had to make noises to keep things in line these nar still believed they were the best that ever was but that had not been proven on a field of blood they will stand mogaba said can they do anything else if terror turns their spines to water they have made their brags right men will do damnfool things just because they said they would what about the rest of my mob most were veterans though few had been into this kind of thing they had handled themselves on the river but you cant be sure what a man will do till he does it i was not sure of myself i have been in and out of battles all my life but i have seen old veterans crack and id never been a general never had to make decisions sure to cost lives did i have the inner toughness it takes to send men to sure death to achieve greater goals i was as new to my role as the greenest taglian soldier ochiba grunted i parted the grass a dozen men approached the ford on the south side welldressed men the enemy captains oneeye time for frogface to do a little eavesdropping check he slithered away goblin gave me a bland look that concealed intense irritation oneeye got to keep his toy and he didnt i was playing favorites children what difference that that snake had damned near killed me frogface came back they were coming in the morning early they expected no resistance they were gloating about what they were going to do to taglios i had the word spread wasnt nobody going to get much sleep tonight was my little army overprepared i saw plenty of the anxiety that comes before the hour of blood but also an eagerness unusual in virgins those taglians knew the odds were long so how come they were confident in the face of probable disaster i realized i did not understand their culture well enough dip into the old trick bag croaker play the captain game i went walking through the camp attended by crows as always speaking to a man here a man there listening to an anecdote about a favorite wife or toddler it was the first time many had seen me up close i tried not to think about lady so naturally she would not get out of my mind they were coming tomorrow at ghoja that meant they had crossed at numa today she might be fighting right now or it might be over she might be dead three thousand enemy soldiers might be racing to get behind me late that afternoon the wagons began arriving sindawe came in from vejagedhya my spirits rose i would get to try my little trick after all stragglers kept coming in all night if we lost the fight the train was gone there would be no getting it out in all that mud oneeye kept frogface flitting across the river to little purpose the enemy strategy was cross that river nothing beyond it dont worry about the mules just load that wagon after nightfall i went up and sat in the damp grass and watched the fires burn on the other side maybe i dozed some off and on whenever i glanced up i noticed that the stars had wheeled along i wakened to a presence a coldness a dread i heard nothing saw nothing smelled nothing but i knew it was there i whispered shifter a great bulk settled beside me i amazed myself i was not afraid this was one of the two greatest surviving sorcerers in the world one of the ten who were taken who had made the ladys empire all but invincible a monster terrible and mad but i was not afraid i even noticed that he did not smell as bad as he used to must be in love he said they come with the light i know they have no sorcery at all only the strength of arms you might conquer i was sort of hoping i would you going to chip in silence for some time then i will contribute only in small ways i do not wish to be noticed by the shadowmasters yet i thought about what little things he could do that might mean a lot we had started to get some traffic nearby taglians lugging fiftypound sacks of charcoal to the foreslope of course how are you with fog can you conjure me up a little weather is not my strength maybe a small patch if theres reason explain be real handy to have a chunk that would lie along the river and reach maybe two hundred feet up this slope bottled this side of the creek over there just so those guys would have to come through it i told him about my trick he liked it he chuckled a small sound that wanted to roar like a volcano man you were always sneaky coldblooded cruel bastards smarter than you looked i like it ill try it should draw no attention and the results may be amusing thank you i was speaking to the air or maybe a nearby crow shifter had gone without a sound i sat there and tormented myself trying to think of something more i might have done trying not to think of lady trying to excuse myself the dying the soldiers crossing the ridge made very little noise later i became aware of a few tendrils of mist forming good there was a bit of rose in the east stars were dying behind me mogaba and the nar were wakening the men across the river enemy sergeants did the same a little more light and i could see the artillery batteries ready to be wheeled into position they had arrived but so far only one wagon loaded with missiles shifter had managed a mist though not all i wanted fifteen feet deep at the ford two hundred fifty yards toward me not quite reaching the band of charcoal ten feet wide that the men had laid out in the night on an arc from the riverbank in the east around to the bank of the creek time to go give the final pep talk i slithered off the crest turned and there was lady she looked like hell but she was grinning you made it just got here she grabbed my hand in hers you won barely she sat down and told me the shadar did good pushed them back across twice but not the third try it broke up into a brawl and chase before we could get into it when we did the shadowmasters men formed up and held out almost all day any survivors a few but they didnt get back across i put some men over right away caught them off guard and took their fortress afterward i sent jah on across she smiled i gave him a hundred men to scout and told him your orders were to circle around behind them here he could be in position this afternoon if he pushes he take heavy losses eight hundred to a thousand hes dead if we blow it here she smiled that would be terrible wouldnt it politically speaking i lifted an eyebrow i still had trouble thinking that way she said i sent a messenger to theri telling the gunni to seize the crossing another is headed for vehdnabota you have the mercy of a spider yes its almost time youd better get dressed dressed showmanship remember we headed for camp i asked you bring any of your men with you some more will straggle in good i wont have to use sindawe chapter thirtysix ghoja i felt like a fool in the getup lady put on me a real ten who were taken costume baroque black armor with little threads of bloody light slithering over it made me look about nine feet tall when i was up on one of those black stallions the helmet was the worst it had big black wings on the side a tall gismo with fluffy black feathers on the crown and what looked like fire burning behind the visor oneeye thought it would look intimidating as hell from a distance goblin figured my enemies would laugh themselves to death lady got into an outfit just as outrageous black grotesque helmet fires i sat there on my horse feeling weird my people were ready oneeye sent frogface to watch the enemy ladys helpers brought shields and lances and swords the shields had grim symbols on them the lances matching pennons she said ive created two nasties with luck we can turn them into something with an image like the taken their names are widowmaker and lifetaker which one do you want to be i closed my visor widowmaker she fisheyed me a good ten seconds before she told somebody to hand me my stuff i took all my old familiar hardware along too frogface popped up get ready chief theyre about to hit the water right spread the word i glanced right i glanced left everyone and everything was ready i had done all i could it was in the hands of the gods or the jaws of fate frogface was down in the mist when the enemy hit the water he popped back i gave a signal a hundred drums started pounding lady and i crossed the ridgeline i guess we made a good show over in the fortress people scurried around and pointed i drew the sword lady had given me gestured for them to turn back they did not i would not have in their place but ill bet they were damned uneasy i advanced down the hill and touched that burning blade to the charcoal strip flame ripped across the slope it burned out in twenty seconds but left the charcoal glowing i got back quickly the fumes were powerful frogface popped up theyre pouring across now chief i could not yet see them through the mists tell them to stop the drums instant silence then the clangor of troops in the mist and their cursing and coughing in the sulphurladen air frogface returned i told him tell mogaba to bring them over the drums started talking again march them in a straight line i muttered thats all i ask mogaba march them in a straight line they came i dared not look to see how they were doing but they passed me soon enough and they were holding formation they assumed positions across the slope from the creek then down to the river on the left with the hinge between legions at the road perfection the enemy began coming out of the mist swirling it staggering disordered coughing furiously cursing they encountered the barrier of charcoal and did not know what to do i gestured with my sword missiles flew it looked like pure unreasoning panic had seized the fortress the enemy captains saw they had walked into it and did not know how to respond they chased their tails and fussed and did not do anything their soldiers just kept coming not knowing what they were walking into until they came out of the mist and found themselves stopped by the charcoal the mist began to drift off downriver shifter could not hold it any longer but a little had been enough they had some competent sergeants on the other side they began bringing up water and cutting paths through the coals with trenching tools they began getting their men into ragged formations behind their shields safer from arrows and javelins i signalled again the wheeled ballistae opened up daring the enemys worst mogaba and ochiba rode back and forth in front of their men exhorting them to stand fast to maintain the integrity of their line my role was cruel now i could do nothing but sit there with the breeze playing around me being symbolic they got aisles cleared through the charcoal and rushed through a lot got dead for their trouble the ballistae ran out of missiles and withdrew but arrows and javelins continued to rain on those coming up from the ford taking a terrible toll more and more pressure all along the line but the legions did not bend and gave as good as they got their lungs were not burned raw by sulphur gasses over half the enemy had crossed the river a third of those had fallen the captains in the fortress remained indecisive the shadowmasters troops kept coming across a furious desperation began to animate them eighty percent over ninety percent the taglians began to give a step here and there i remained frozen an iron symbol frogface i muttered into my helmet i need you now the imp materialized perched on my mounts neck what you need chief i filled him up with orders i wanted relayed to murgen to otto and hagpp to sindawe to damned near everybody i could think of some ordered next steps of the plan some involved innovations the morning had been remarkably crowfree now that changed two monsters damned near as big as chickens settled on my shoulders they were nobodys imagination i felt their weight others saw them lady turned to look at them a flock passed over the battlefield circled the fortress settled into the trees along the riverbank the enemy infantry was across their train was getting organized to follow thousands of the shadowmasters men were down i doubted they had the advantage of numbers anymore but experience had begun to tell my taglians were giving ground i felt the first flutters of panic nipping at their formations frogface materialized couple wagons with ballista shafts came in chief get them up to the engines then tell otto and hagop its time maybe seven hundred horsemen had straggled in from numa by then they were dead tired but they were in place and ready they did what they were supposed to do they stumbled up out of the cover of the creek they sliced through the chaos behind the enemy line like the fabled hot knife through butter soft butter then they came back across the hillside cutting at the back of the enemy line like scythes felling wheat murgen came over the hill behind me displaying the black company standard boldly sindawes bunch were behind him murgen halted between lady and me a few steps back the artillery began feeling for the range to the fortress goblin and oneeye and maybe even shifter had been at work using little charms to decompose the mortar between stones its going to work i muttered i think were going to do it the cavalry sortie did it they did not get sorted out for another charge before men began running for the ford the second charge bogged down in the sheer mass of fleeing men mogaba i love you the men he had trained did not break formation and charge he and ochiba hustled up and down their lines getting the ranks dressed and the injured out of the way ballista shafts were knocking stones out of the fortress wall the captains up top gawked a few of feeble courage abandoned the battlements i raised my sword and pointed the drums started i began walking my mount forward lady kept pace as did murgen and the standard oneeye and goblin worked up a more terrible glamor around us my two crows shrieked they could be heard above the tumult the enemy train was all crowded up the other side of the ford now the teamsters fled leaving them blocking the retreat of their comrades we had them in a bottle the cork was in and most of them had their backs to us the grim work began i continued my slow advance people stayed away from me and lady and the standard archers on the battlements tried dropping me but somebody had put some pretty good spells on my armor nothing got through though for a while it was like being in a barrel somebody was whacking with a hammer enemy soldiers began jumping in the river and swimming for it the ballistae had a good range all their shafts striking in a small area the watchtower creaked and grumbled then rumbled a big chunk fell out and soon the whole tower collapsed taking parts of the fortress wall with it i pushed into the river across the ford and on up between wagons the standard and sindawes men followed the only enemies i saw were heeling and toeing it south amazing i never struck a blow myself it was almost workaday stuff for sindawes bunch to begin clearing the wagons for some to worm through behind murgen and cover him while he planted the standard on the fortress wall fighting continued on the north bank but the thing had been decided it was over and won and i did not believe it it had been close to being too easy i had not used all the arrows in my quiver though chaos continued around me i took out my map case to check out what lay to the south chapter thirtyseven shadowlight coaldark tears rage and panic contended in the fountained hall at shadowlight moonshadow mewled dire prophecies stormshadow raged one maintained a silence as deep as that within a buried coffin and one was not there at all though a voice spoke for him dark and mocking i said a million men might not be enough silence worm stormshadow snarled they have obliterated your invincible armies children they have forced bridgeheads everywhere what will you do now whimpering dogs your provinces are a prostrate and naked woman a twohundredmile jaunt behind the lance of passion and they will be hammering at the gates of stormgard what will you do what will you do what will you do oh woe what hast befallen thee insane laughter rolled out of that black absence in the air stormshadow snarled you havent been a whole hell of a lot of help have you you and your games trying to catch dorotea senjak how well did you do eh what would you have done with their captain did you have a bargain in mind some deal to trade us for the power they bring did you think you could use them to close the gate if you did youre the greatest fool of all whine children moan and wail they are upon you maybe if you beg ill save you yet again moonshadow snapped bold chatter from one without the ability to save himself yes in the traditions of their company they caught us off balance they did what is for them old routine the impossible but the fighting along the main was just one move in the game only a pawn has vanished from the board if they come south every step will carry them a step nearer their dooms laughter the silent one broke his fast of words there are three of us in the fullness of our power but two great ones dog the path of the black company and they have little interest in furthering its goals and she is a cripple feeble as a mouse more laughter once upon a time someone named the true name of dorotea senjak so now she is the lady no more she has no more powers than a talented child but do you believe she lost her memory when she lost those powers you do not or you would not accuse me as you have perhaps she will grow frightened enough or desperate enough to confide in the great one who changes no retort that was the dread that haunted them all moonshadow said the reports are confused still a great disaster has befallen our army but we are dealing with the black company the chance has always existed we have prepared for it we will regain our composure we will deal with them but there is a mystery from the fighting at ghoja two dire figures were seen there great dark beings on giant steeds that breathed fire beings immune to the bite of darts the names widowmaker and lifetaker have been breathed by those who stood with the black company this was news to the others stormshadow said we must learn more about this it may explain their luck the hole in the air you must act if you do not want to be devoured i suggest you put aside terror eschew squabbling and cease the dispensation of accusation i suggest you think of a way to go for the jugular no one replied perhaps i will contribute myself when next fate tries to take its cut well stormshadow mused the fear has at last penetrated as far as overlook the bickering resumed but without heart four minds rotated toward thwarting that doom from the north chapter thirtyeight invaders of the shadowlands tired is not quite so important when you have just beaten the odds youve got energy to celebrate i did not want a celebration enemy soldiers were still trying to get away i wanted my men to get on with what we had to do while they still thought they were supermen i had my staff together before the chaos started sorting itself out otto hagop come morning you head east along the river and break up the force guarding the prisoners building this levee system big bucket candles you guys get this side of the ford cleaned up look through these wagons and see what weve got mogaba get the battlefield cleaned up collect weapons oneeye get our casualties moved back to vejagedhya ill help when i get time dont let those taglian butchers do anything stupid we had a dozen volunteer physicians along their ideas of medicine were pretty primitive lady what do we know about this dejagore dejagore was the nearest big city south of the main two hundred miles down the road besides the fact that its a walled city a shadowmaster makes his headquarters there which one moonshadow i think no stormshadow thats it if youd take prisoners you might find out something from them i raised an eyebrow she prodding me about excesses keep that in mind otto bring those prisoners when you catch up all fifty thousand as many as dont run away im hoping some will be mad enough to help us out the rest we can use for labor mogaba asked youre going to invade the shadowlands he knew i was he wanted a formal declaration yes they supposedly only have fifty thousand men under arms we just creamed a third i dont think they can get another mob as big together in time if we go at them as hard as we can as fast as we can audacity he said yeah keep hitting them and dont give them a chance to get their feet under them again lady chided theyre sorcerers croaker what happens when they come out themselves then shifter will have to kick in dont worry about the mules just load the wagons weve worked on sorcerers before nobody argued maybe they should have but we all felt that fate had handed us an opportunity and we would be idiots to waste it i figured too that since we had not expected to survive the first contest we were out nothing by pressing onward i wonder how beloved these shadowmasters are to their subjects can we expect local support no comment we would find out the hard way talk went on and on eventually i left it to help with the medical work patching and sewing while issuing orders through a procession of messengers i got me two hours sleep that night the cavalry was heading out east and mogabas legion had begun its southward advance when lady joined me shifter has been scouting he says you can detect an almost visible change as news of the battle spreads the mass of people are excited those who collaborate with the shadowmasters are confused and frightened theyll probably panic and run when they hear were coming good even great in ten days we would find out for sure how much impact ghoja had had i meant to advance on dejagore at twenty miles a day the roads south of the main were dry how lovely that must have been for them jahamaraj jah had gotten his survivors into position in time and set a series of clever ambushes his mob scrubbed two thousand fugitives from ghoja he was not pleased with my invasion plans he was even less pleased when i drafted his followers and distributed them as replacements for men we had lost but he did not argue much we encountered no resistance in territories formerly belonging to taglios we received warm welcomes in villages still occupied by their original inhabitants the natives were cooler farther south but not inimical they thought we were too good to be true we encountered our first enemy patrols six days south of ghoja they avoided contact i told everybody to look professional and mean otto and hagop caught up dragging along thirty thousand people from the levee project i looked them over they had not been treated well there were some very angry bitter men among them hagop said they were all willing to help defeat the shadowmasters damn me i said a year and a half ago there were seven of us now were a horde pick out the ones in the best shape arm them with captured weapons add them to the legions so every fourth man in mogabas and ochibas is a new one that would mean trained men left over so move them over to sindawe give him one in four too should bring him up to strength anybody else we arm we can use as auxiliaries and garrisons for some of these smaller cities the countryside was not heavily populated between the river and here but nearer dejagore that would change the rest can tag along well use them somehow but how would i feed them wed used up our own supplies and had started on those captured at ghoja dejagore looked less promising now some of the rescued prisoners hailed from that city they said the walls were forty feet high the resident shadowmaster was a demon for keeping them up what will be will be i thought the bloom was off the rose wed all had time to think still morale was better than it had been moving toward ghoja there were skirmishes the next few days but nothing serious mostly otto and hagops boys overhauling enemy troops not hurrying fast enough to get away the cavalry had begun to behave professionally at last i allowed foraging under strict rules looting only where people had fled it worked mostly trouble came only where i expected it from oneeye whose motto is that anything not nailed down is his and anything he can pry loose isnt nailed down we knocked over some towns and small cities with no trouble the last few i left to the freed prisoners cynically letting them vent their wrath while saving my better troops the nearer dejagore we got official name stormgard according to the shadowmasters the more tamed the country became we made the last days march through rolling hills that had been terraced and strewn with irrigation canals so it was startling to come out of the hills and see the city itself stormgard was surrounded by a plain as flat as a tabletop extending a mile in all directions with the exception of several small mounds maybe ten feet tall the plain looked like a manicured lawn i dont like the looks of that i told mogaba too contrived lady remind you of anything she gave me a blank look the approach to the tower i see that but here theres room for maneuver we got some daylight left lets get down there and get set up mogaba asked how will you fortify the camp we had seen little timber lately turn the wagons on their sides nothing moved on the plain only haze over the city indicated life there i want a closer look at that lady when we get down there dig out the costumes my horde flooded onto the plain still no sign anyone in stormgard was interested i sent for murgen and the standard the way people thought about the company here in the south maybe stormgard would surrender without a fight lady looked terrible in her lifetaker rig i supposed i looked as grim they were effective outfits they would have scared me had i seen them coming at me mogaba ochiba and sindawe invited themselves along they had dolled up in stuff theyd worn in geaxle they looked pretty fierce themselves mogaba told me i want to see those walls too sure then here came goblin and oneeye in an instant i saw that goblin had had the idea and oneeye had decided to go lest goblin somehow get ahead on points no clowning you guys understand goblin grinned his big frog grin sure croaker sure you know me thats the trouble i know you both goblin faked bruised feelings you guys make these costumes look good hear youll strike terror to the roots of their souls oneeye promised theyll flee from the walls screaming sure they will everybody ready they were around it from the right i told murgen at the canter as close as you dare he rode out lady and i followed twenty yards behind as i got started two monster crows plopped down on my shoulders a flock came out of the hills and raced ahead circling the city we got close enough to see the scramble on the walls and impressive walls they were at least forty feet high what nobody had bothered to mention was that the city was built upon a mound that raised it another forty feet above the plain this was going to be a bitch a few arrows wobbled out and fell short finesse cunning trickery only a dip would go up against those walls croaker i had had liberated prisoners work up maps i had a good idea of the citys layout four gates four paved roads approached from the points of the compass rose like spokes of a wheel nasty barbicans and towers protected the gates more towers along the wall for laying enfilading fire along its face not pleasant it was very quiet up on those walls they had one eye on us and one on the horde still pouring out of the hills wondering where the hell we all came from we got us a little surprise south of stormgard there was a military camp there a big one set maybe four hundred yards from the city wall oh shit i said and yelled at murgen he misunderstood on purpose probably though ill never prove it he kicked his mount into a gallop and headed for the gap between arrows rose from the wall and camp miraculously they fell without doing any harm i glanced back as we entered the throat of the gap that little shit goblin was standing on his saddle he was bent over with his pants down telling the world what he thought of the shadowmasters and their boys naturally those folks took exception as they say in the chansons the sky darkened with arrows i was certain fate would take its cut now but we had moved far and fast enough the arrowstorm fell behind us goblin howled mockingly that irritated somebody bigger a bolt of lightning from nowhere struck ahead ripping a steaming hole in the turf murgen leapt it so did i with my stomach creeping toward my throat i was sure the next shot would fry somebody in his boots goblin went right on mooning stormgard horsemen began pouring out of the camp they were no problem we could outrun them i tried to concentrate on the wall just in case i got out of this alive a second bolt seared the backs of my eyeballs but it too went astray though i think it shifted course just before it hit when my sight cleared i spied a giant wolf racing in from our right covering ground in strides that beggared those of our black stallions my old pal shifter right on time another two bolts missed the gardner was going to be pissed about all the divots knocked out of his lawn we completed our circuit and headed for camp our pursuers gave up as we dismounted mogaba said weve drawn fire now we know what were up against one of the shadowmasters is in there there may be another in that camp lady said i felt something whered shifter get to he had disappeared again everybody shrugged i hoped hed sit in on a brainstorming session goblin that was a dumb stunt it sure was made me feel forty years younger wish id thought of it oneeye grumbled well they know were here and they know were bad but i dont see them making a run for it guess well have to figure out how to kick their butts mogaba said evidently they mean to fight outside the walls otherwise that encampment would not be there yeah things skipped through my mind stunts tricks strategies as though id been born to come up with them by the hundred well leave them alone tonight well form up and offer battle in the morning but let them come to us where are those city maps i got a notion we talked for hours while the chaos of a camp still settling raged around us after dark i sent men out to rig a few tricks and plant stakes on which the legions could form and guide their advance i said we shouldnt bother ourselves too much i dont think theyll fight us unless we get in close to the walls get some sleep well see what happens in the morning many pairs of eyes looked at me all at once then in cadence shifted to lady a swarm of smiles came and went then everyone went away behind their smiles leaving us alone big bucket and those guys dont fool around they had gone into the hills and diverted one of the irrigation canals to bring water to the camp i figured it in my head to give every man in the mob one cup we needed about gallons with the animals run it to but man and beast need more than a cup to get by i dont know what the flow was on the canal but not a lot of water was getting wasted not much manpower was going to waste either the boys from opal had dug some holding ponds one they set aside for bathing being the boss wazoo i crowded the line still soggy i made sure mogaba had done all the things i didnt really have to check sentries out barricade manned night orders posted oneeye working frogface on scouting missions instead of loafing what have you i was stalling this was the night i ran out of busybodying so finally went to my tent i got out my map of stormgard studied it again then got to work transcribing these annals they have grown more spare than i like but that has been the price of keeping up maybe murgen will get me to let go i did three pages and some lines and began to relax thinking she would not come after all but then she came in she had bathed too her hair was damp a ghost of lavender or lilac or something hung around her she was a little pale and a little shaky and not quite able to meet my eye at a loss what to do or say now that she was here she buttoned the tent flap i closed this book it went into a brassbound chest i closed my ink and cleaned my pen i could think of nothing to say either the whole shy routine was dumb we had been playing around like this and getting older for over a year hell we were grownup people i was old enough to be a grandfather might even be one for all i knew and she was old enough to be everybodys grandmother somebody had to take the bull by the horns we couldnt go on forever both of us waiting for the other one to make a move so why didnt she do something you the guy croaker yeah i killed the candles went and took her hand it was not that dark in there plenty of firelight leaked through the fabric of the tent she shivered like a captive mouse at first but it did not take her long to reach a point of no turning back and for goddamned once nothing happened to interrupt the old general amazed himself the woman amazed him even more sometime in the wee hours the exhausted boss general promised tomorrow night again within the walls of stormgard maybe in stormshadows own bed she wanted to know the basis for his confidence as time labored on she just got more awake and lively but the old man fell asleep on her chapter thirtynine stormgard even i grumbled about the time of day i got everybody up we all ate hurriedly my valiant commanders in a clique so they could pester me about my plans a crow perched on the tent pole at the front of my tent one eye cocked my way or maybe ladys the bastard was leering i thought really werent we getting enough of that from the others i felt great lady though seemed to be having trouble moving with her usual fluid grace and everybody knew what that meant the smirking freaks i dont understand you captain mogaba protested why wont you lay it all out what only i know inside my head only i can betray just assemble up on the stakes i had put out and offer battle if they accept well see how it goes if they dont kick our butts well worry about the next step mogabas lips tightened into a prune he did not like me much right then thought i didnt trust him he glanced over to where cletus and his bunch were trying to assemble shovels and baskets and bags in numbers enough for an army they had a thousand men out scouring the hill farms for tools and more baskets and buckets and had men sewing bags cut from the canvas coverings from the wagons they knew only that i had told them to get ready for some major massive earthmoving another thousand men were out trying to forage timber you need a lot of timber to invest a city patience my friend patience all will be clear in due time i chuckled oneeye muttered he learned his trade from our old captain dont tell nobody nothing till you find some gink trying to shove a spear up your butt they could not get to me this morning he and goblin could have had them a fuss as bad as back in taglios and id have just grinned i used a wad of bread to finish soaking up the grease on my plate all right lets get dressed and go kick some ass two things to be observed about being the only guy in forty thousand to get some the night before thirtynine thousand nine hundred ninetynine guys are so envious they hate your guts but youre in such a positive mood it becomes infectious and you can always tell them their share is behind those walls over there scouts reported while i was getting into my widowmaker rig they said the enemy was coming out of the camp and the city both and there were a lot of the bastards at least ten thousand in the camp and maybe every man from the city who could be armed that bunch would not be thrilled to be headed into a fight and they werent likely to be experienced i arrayed mogabas legion on the left ochibas on the right and put sindawes new outfit in the middle behind them i put all the former prisoners wed been able to arm and hoped they did not look too much like a rabble the front formations looked good in their white organized and professional and ready intimidation games i had each legion arrayed by hundreds with aisles between the companies i hoped the other side would not be smart enough to jump on that right away lady grabbed my hand before she mounted up squeezed tonight in stormgard right i kissed her cheek she whispered i dont think i can stand to sit on this saddle im sore curse of being a woman i mounted up two big black crows dropped onto my shoulders immediately their sudden weight startling me everybody gawked i scanned the hills but saw no sign of my walking stump but we were making some kind of headway here this was the second time everybody else saw the crows i donned my helmet oneeye stoked the fires of illusion i assumed my post in front of mogabas legion lady moved out in front of ochibas bunch murgen planted the standard in front of sindawes legion ten paces in front of everyone else i was tempted to charge right then the other side was having a fire drill trying to get organized but i gave them a while from the looks of them most of the ones out of stormgard did not want to be there let them look at us all in neat array all in white all ready to carve them up let them think about how nice it would be to get back inside those incredible walls i signalled murgen he trotted forward galloped along the face of the enemy showing the standard arrows flew and missed he shouted mockeries they were not terrified into running for it my two crows flapped after him and were joined by thousands more who came from the gods knew where the brotherhood of death winging it over the doomed nice touch old stump but not enough to make anybody run away my two crows returned to my shoulders i felt like a monument i hoped crows had better manners than pigeons murgen did not get enough of a rise first pass so he rode back the other direction yelling louder i noted a disturbance in the enemy formation moving forward someone or something seated in the lotus position all in black floating five feet off the ground drifted to a halt a dozen yards in front of the other army shadowmaster had to be i got a creepy feeling just looking at it me there in my spiffy but fake outfit murgens taunts got somebodys goat a handful of horsemen then a bunch lit out after him he turned in the saddle and shouted at them there was no way they could catch him of course not when he was on that horse i grumbled the indiscipline was not as general as i wanted murgen dawdled letting them come closer and closer then took off when they were only a dozen yards away they chased him right into the maze of tripwires id had woven into the grass during the night men and horses sprawled more horses tripped on animals already down my archers lofted arrows that fell straight down and slaughtered most of the men and horses i drew my sword which smoked and smoldered and signalled the advance the drums beat the slow cadence the men in the front rank slashed the tripwires finished the wounded otto and hagop on the flanks had trumpets sounded but did not charge not yet my boys could march in a straight line on that nice flat ground they kept their dress all across their front that had to be an impressive sight from across the way where they still had guys who hadnt found their places in ranks we passed the first of the several low mounds that spotted the plain the artillery was supposed to get up on that one and mass fire wherever it seemed appropriate i hoped cletus and the boys had sense enough to harass the shadowmaster that critter was the big unknown quantity here i hoped shifter was around somewhere this whole thing could go to hell if he wasnt and that bastard over there cut loose two hundred yards away their archers lofted poorly aimed shafts at lady and me i halted gave another signal the legions halted too very good the nar were paying attention gods there were a lot of them over there and that shadowmaster just floating there maybe waiting for me to stick my foot in it seemed like i was staring up his nostrils but he did not do anything the ground shuddered the enemy ranks stirred they saw it coming and it was too late for them to do anything the elephants thundered up the aisles through the legions gaining momentum when those monsters passed me the guys over there were already yelling and looking for somewhere to run a salvo of twelve ballistae shafts ripped overhead and spattered around the shadowmaster they were well aimed four actually struck him they encountered protective sorceries but battered him around very sluggish the shadowmaster keeping himself alive seemed to be his limit a second salvo hit him an instant before the elephants reached his men the ballistae had been laid even more carefully i gave the signal that sent my front four thousand men and the cavalry howling forward the remainder of the men formed a normal front then advanced the carnage was incredible we drove them back and back and back but there were so damned many of them we never really broke them when they did flee the majority made it into the camp none got back into stormgard the city had closed its gates on them they dragged their shadowmaster champion with them i would not have bothered he had been useless as tits on a boar hog of course one of the second flight of ballistae shafts had gotten through his protection i suppose that distracted him his ineffectuality had to be shifters doing they left maybe five thousand men behind the warlord side of me was disappointed id hoped to do more damage i was not going to storm the camp to do it though i backed the men off set men to police up our casualties placed cavalry to meet anyone coming out of camp or city then got on with business i planted my right wing yards from the road we had followed down to stormgard just out of bowshot of the barbican at the gate it entered my line ran at right angles to the road i let the men relax my levee builders got to work putting their training to use on the far side of the road they began digging a trench it started a bowshot from the wall and ran to the foot of the hills it would be wide and deep and would shield my flank the workers carried the earth to the road and began building a ramp others began building mantlets to protect the ramp builders as they approached the wall that many men can move a lot of earth the defenders saw we would have a ramp right up to the wall in just a few days they were not pleased but they had no means to stop us men scurried like ants the former prisoners had scores to even and went at it like they wanted blood by sundown by midafternoon they were taking the city end of the trench downward deep and toward the wall not hiding the fact that they were mining aiming to go under as well as over and they had begun breaking ground for a trench on my left flank as well in three days my army would be protected by a pair of deep trenches that would funnel my attack up the ramp and over the wall there would be no stopping us they had to do something in there i hoped to do something to them before they thought of something to do to me late afternoon the sky began clouding over lightning frolicked behind the hills to the south not a good sign a storm would be tougher on my guys than on theirs even so despite the cold wind and scattered sprinkles moving in the builders only broke for a spartan supper before setting out lanterns and building bonfires so they could continue after dark i posted pickets so there would be no surprises began rotating my troops out of position for food and rest some day all id had to do was sit in one place and look elegant and give orders id already worked out in my head and think about what last night had meant in its highly anticlimactic fashion it had been a night of nights of nights but it had not lived up to the anticipation had even been in a wellwevefinallygottenaroundtoit way something of a disappointment not that i would trade it in or take it back never someday when im old and retired and have nothing better to do than philosophize im going to sit down for a year and figure out why its always better in the anticipation than in the consummation i sent frogface flitting around checking the enemys mood that was black they wanted no more fighting after duking it out with elephants stormgards walls were not heavily patrolled most of the male population had marched out in the morning and not made it back but frogface reported no great distress around the central citadel where another shadowmaster was in residence in fact he thought he sensed confidence in the eventual outcome the storm marched north and it was a bitch kitty i gathered my captains we got a mean storm coming might make what were going to try tricky but were going to do it anyway be even less expected goblin oneeye get the dust off your old reliable snooze spell they eyed me suspiciously goblin muttered here it comes some damnfool reason for not getting any sleep again tonight oneeye told him im going to use that spell on him one of these first days louder right croaker whats up us up and over those walls and open the gate after you put the sentries to sleep even lady was surprised youre going to waste all that work on that ramp i never intended to use it i wanted them convinced i was committed to a certain course mogaba smiled i suspected hed figured it out ahead of time it wont work goblin muttered i gave him a look the men working the trenches at the city end are armed i promised them first crack at getting even we get the gates open all we have to do is lean back and watch wont work youre forgetting that shadowmaster in there you think youre going to sneak up on him yes our guardian angel will make sure shifter id trust him as far as i can throw a pregnant elephant i say anything about trusting him he wants us for a stalking horse for some scheme hes got to keep us healthy right your mind is going croaker oneeye said you been hanging around lady too long she kept a blank face on that might not have been a compliment mogaba ill need a dozen of the nar after goblin and oneeye put the sentries to sleep frogface will climb the wall with a rope and anchor it your boys will go up and take the barbican from the rear and open the gate he nodded how soon anytime oneeye send frogface scouting i want to know what that shadowmaster is doing if hes watching us we wont go we moved an hour later it went like operations go in textbooks like it was ordained by the gods in another hour every one of the freed prisoners except those we had enrolled in the legions was inside the city they reached the citadel and broke in before resistance developed they raged through stormgard ignoring the rain and thunder and lightning venting a lot of rage probably mostly in directions askew me in my widowmaker suit stalked through the open gates fifteen minutes after the mob rush lifetaker rode beside me the locals eowered away from us though some seemed to be welcoming their liberators halfway to the citadel lady said you even fooled me this time when you said tonight in stormgard a gust and ferocious fusillade of rain silenced her lightning cut loose in a sudden vicious duel by the flashes i witnessed the passage of a pair of panthers that i would have missed otherwise chills not of the rain crawled my spine i had seen that bigger one before in another embattled city when i was young they were headed toward the citadel too i asked what are they up to my confidence was less than complete there were no crows out in this storm i realized i had come to count them my good luck i dont know better check it i increased my pace there were a lot of dead men around the entrance to the citadel most were my laborers sounds of fighting still echoed inside grinning guards saluted me clumsily i asked wheres the shadowmaster i hear shes in the big tower up high her men are fighting like crazy but she isnt helping them thunder and lightning went mad for a full minute bolts smashed at the city had the god of thunders gone crazy but for the torrential rainfall a hundred fires might have started i pitied the legions out there on guard maybe mogaba would bring them in out of it the storm died into an almost normal rain after that last insane fit with only a few lightweight flashes i looked up the one tower that loomed over the rest of the citadel and deja vu in a flash spied a cat shape scaling its face damn me the thunder had left me unable to hear the horses coming i looked back oneeye goblin and murgen still flaunting the company standard oneeye was staring up at the tower his face was not pleasant to behold he was flashing on the same memory forvalaka croaker shifter i know im wondering if it was him last time whatre you talking about lady asked i said murgen lets plant that standard up where the world can see it when the sun comes up right we stalked into the citadel lady trying to find out what had passed between me and oneeye i developed a hearing problem oneeye took the lead we climbed dark stairs where the footing was treacherous because of blood and bodies there was no more fighting going on above us ominous the last fighters of both sides were in a chamber a couple stories from the top all dead sorcery here goblin muttered we go up oneeye snapped i know total agreement between them for once i drew my sword there was no flame in it and no color to my costume now goblin and oneeye had other things on their minds we caught up with shifter and the shadowmaster in the parapet of the tower shifter had assumed human form he had the shadowmaster at bay it was a tiny thing in black almost impossible to take seriously as a danger there was no sign of shifters sidekick i told goblin theres one missing keep an eye out got you he knew what was going on he was as serious as ever ive seen him shifter started moving in on the shadowmaster it had nowhere to retreat i gestured lady to move out to his right i went left im not sure what oneeye was doing i glanced toward the camp south of the city the rain had stopped while we were inside the tower the camp was plainly visible by its own lights i got the impression they knew something was wrong over here but they were not about to come find out what they were nice and close put artillery on the wall and life could get miserable for them the shadowmaster backed up against the merlons edging the parapet apparently able to do nothing why were they impotent this one was who stormshadow shifter was close enough to touch now one hand darted out and ripped the black robing off the shadowmaster i gawked i heard ladys gasp from fifteen feet away oneeye said it ill go to hell stormbringer but shes supposed to be dead stormbringer another of the original ten who were taken another one who was supposed to have perished in the battle at charm after murdering the hanged man and and shifter aha i said to me said i aha a settlement of scores shifter knew all the time shifter had been out to get stormbringer from the start and where one mysteriously surviving taken was in business for herself might there not be more like about three more what the hell they all still around but the hanged man limper and soulcatcher id seen those three go down myself lady stood there shaking her head were even those three gone i had killed limper myself once and he had come back chills got me again when they were shadowmasters they were anonymous creeps who had only standardissue cause to do me grief but the taken some of them had very special and personal cause to hate the company this moment of revelation had turned it into a whole different kind of war i have no idea what passed between shifter and bringer but it left the air crackling with electric hatred stormbringer seemed powerless why a few minutes ago she had been bringing in that monster of a storm to whip on us shifter was no greater power than she unless somehow he had come upon that bane of all the taken a true name i looked at lady she knew it she knew all their true names she had not lost her knowledge when she had lost her powers power i had not thought about what id had here almost under my thumb all this time what she knew was worth the ransoms of a hundred princes the secrets locked in her head could enslave or deliver empires if you knew she had them some folks knew she had a lot more guts than id realized coming out of the tower and empire with me i had to do some rethinking and strategic reorientation these shadowmasters shifter the howler they all knew what id just realized she was damned lucky she hadnt been snatched already and squeezed dry shifter laid his huge ugly hands on stormbringer and only then did she begin to resist with sudden startling violence she did something that hurled shifter all the way across the parapet he lay there for a moment eyes glassy bringer made a break i came around with a swordstroke i brought in from the moon right into her belly it did not mark her but it stopped her in her tracks lady hacked at her overhand she rolled away from the stroke i whacked her again but she got up and started heading out again and her fingers were dancing sparks played between them oh shit oneeye tripped her lady and i hacked at her again without much effect then murgen let her have it with the spearhead on the lance that bore the company standard she howled like one of the damned what the hell she started moving again but now shifter was back he had taken the form of the forvalaka the black wereleopard almost impossible to kill or injure he jumped on stormbringer and started tearing her apart she gave damned near as good as she got we backed away stayed away gave them room i dont know what shifter did or when or if he did anything at all oneeye might have imagined it all but sometime during the thing the little black man sidled up and whispered he did it croaker it was him that killed tomtom that was a long time ago i had almost no feelings about it anymore but oneeye had not forgotten nor forgiven that was his brother what you going to do i dont know something i got to do something whatll that do to the rest of us we wont have an angel anymore aint gonna have one anyway croaker hes done got what he wanted right there shifter or no shifter youre on your own soon as he finishes her off he was right and chances were damned good shifter would stop being ladys faithful old dog too if there was any getting him this was the time the combatants went on for maybe fifteen minutes shredding each other i got the impression things were not going as easy as shifter had hoped bringer was putting up a damned good fight but he won sort of she stopped resisting he lay panting unable to move shed locked her limbs around him he bled from a hundred small wounds he cursed softly and i thought i heard him damning someone for helping her heard him threatening to get someone next you got any special use for him now i asked lady i dont know how much you knew i dont care now but you better think about what hes going to have on his mind now he dont need you and me for a stalking horse anymore she shook her head slowly something slid over the edge of the parapet behind her another smaller forvalaka i thought we were in big trouble but shifters apprentice made a tactical error she began to shift forms she finished just in time to shriek no at oneeye oneeye had made him a club out of something and with two quick and heroic swings he bashed stormbringer and shapeshifter into complete unconsciousness they had weakened one another that much shifters companion flew at him murgen tripped her by tangling her feet with the head of the lance he carried he cut her blood got all over the standard she screamed like she was trapped in hells agony i recognized her then she had done a lot of yelling the last time id seen her so long ago sometime during the excitement a whole herd of crows had gathered on the merlons out of the way they started laughing everybody jumped on the woman before she could do anything goblin did some kind of swift magical bind that left her unable to do anything but wiggle her eyes oneeye looked at me and said you got any suture with you croaker i got a needle but i dont think i got enough thread what some i always carried some medical odds and ends gimme i gave him he whacked shifter and bringer again just to make sure theyre out they dont got no special powers when theyre out he squatted down and started sewing their mouths shut he finished shifter said get him stripped whack him if he stirs what the hell it got gruesome then more gruesome what the hell you doing i demanded the crows were having a party sewing all the holes shut so the devils dont get out what maybe it made sense to him it didnt to me old trick for getting rid of evil witch doctors back home when he finished with the orifices he sewed fingers and toes together put them in a sack with a hundred pounds of rocks and throw them in the river lady said youll have to burn them and grind whats left into powder and scatter the powder on the wind oneeye looked at her for ten seconds you mean i done all this work for nothing no itll help you dont want them getting excited while youre roasting them i gave her a startled look that was not like her i turned to murgen you want to get that standard up oneeye stirred shifters apprentice with a toe what about this one think i should take care of her too she hasnt done anything i squatted beside her i remember you now darling it took me a while because we didnt see that much of you in juniper you werent very nice to my buddy marron shed i looked at lady what were you figuring on making out of her she did not answer be that way well talk later i looked at the apprentice lisa daela bowalk you hear me name your name the way these others did crows chuckled to one another im going to give you a break that you probably dont deserve murgen find some place to lock this one up well turn her loose when were ready to move out goblin you help oneeye with whatever hes got to do i looked at the company standard bloodstained once again flying defiantly again you pointing at oneeye take care of it right unless you want two more of them after us the way limper was he gulped air yeah lady i told you tonight in stormgard lets go find someplace something was wrong with me i felt mildly depressed vaguely let down once again victim of an anticlimax of a hollow victory why two great wickednesses were about to be removed from the face of the earth luck had marched with the company once more we had added more impossible triumphs to our roll of victories we were two hundred miles nearer our destination than wed had any right to hope there was no obvious reason to expect much trouble from those troops locked up in that camp south of the city their shadowmaster captain was wounded the people of stormgard for the most part were accepting us as liberators what was to be bothered about chapter forty dejagore tonight in stormgard tonight in stormgard was something though somehow tainted with that lack of satisfaction that haunted me increasingly i slept well past dawn a bugle wakened me the first thing i saw when i cracked my lids was a big black bastard of a crow eyeballing lady and me i threw something at it another bugle call i stumbled to a window then streaked to another lady get up we got trouble trouble snaked out of the southern hills in the form of another enemy army mogaba had our boys getting into formation already over on the south wall cletus and his brothers had the artillery harassing the encampment but their engines could not keep that mob from getting ready for a fight the people of the city poured from their houses headed for the walls to watch crows were everywhere lady took a look snapped lets get dressed and started helping me with my costume i helped with hers i said of mine this thing is starting to smell you may not have to wear it much longer eh that bunch coming out of the hills has to be just about everybody theyve got left under arms break them and the war is over sure except for three shadowmasters who might not see it that way i stepped to the window shaded my eyes i thought i could detect a black dot floating among the soldiers we dont have anybody on our side now maybe i shouldnt have been so hasty with shifter you did the right thing hed fulfilled his agenda he might even have joined the others against us he had no grudge against them did you know who they were i never suspected honest not till a day or two ago then it seemed too unlikely to mention lets get at it she kissed me and it was a kiss with oomph behind it wed come a long way she put her helmet on and turned into the grim dark thing called lifetaker i did my magic trick and turned into widowmaker the scurrying rats who people stormgard i guessed we should change the name back when the dust settled stared at us in fear and awe as we strode through the streets mogaba met us hed brought our horses we mounted up i asked how bad does it look cant tell yet with two battles under our belts and two victories id say were the more tempered force but therell be a lot of them and i dont think you have any more tricks up your sleeves youre right about that this is the last thing i expected if this shadowmaster uses his power dont mention it to the men theyve been warned we might encounter unusual circumstances theyve been told to ignore them and get on with their jobs you want to use the elephants again everything every damned thing weve got this one could be the whole war win it weve got them off taglioss back and weve opened the road all the way south they wont have an army left to field he grunted the same went for us we got out onto the field in moments i had messengers flying everywhere most of them trying to dig my armed laborers out of the city we were going to need every sword mogaba had sent the cavalry off to scout and harass already good man mogaba the crows seemed to be having a great time watching the show take shape the shadowmaster out there was in no hurry he got his men out of the hills and into formation despite my cavalry then had his horsemen chase mine off otto and hagop might have whipped them but id sent instructions not to try they just came back leading the enemy pelting him with arrows from their saddle bows i wanted them to rest their animals before the main event we did not have enough remounts to carry a proper cavalry campaign i detailed a few men to assemble the former prisoners as they showed and send them off to get in the way of anybody who sallied from the camp with weapons captured yesterday and during the night more than half were now armed they were not trained and were not skilled but they were determined i sent word for cletus and his brothers to move the artillery over where he could give us support and could bombard the encampment gate i looked across at the new army mogaba any ideas at a guess there were fifteen thousand of them they looked at least as competent as those wed met at the ghoja ford limited but not amateurs no dont look like theyre in a hurry to get at it would you be not if i had a shadowmaster and had hopes wed come to them anybody else got any ideas goblin shook his head oneeye said the shadowmasters are the key you take them out or you dont got a chance teach your grandmother to suck eggs messenger come here i had one idea i sent him to draft one of the nar and have him head into town round up a thousand armed prisoners and go to the citys west gate when the fighting started he was to hit the camp from behind it was something lady said oneeye is right i think it pained her to have to say that and the one to concentrate on is the healthy one this is a time for illusion she outlined an idea ten minutes later i ordered the cavalry forward to nip at the enemy and try to draw their cavalry out to see what the shadowmaster would or would not do himself i really wished i could count on the prisoners to hold off the men in that camp in the half hour it took the shadowmaster to lose patience with being harassed oneeye and goblin put together the grand illusion of their careers they began by recreating the ghost of the company they had used in that forest up north where we captured the bandits i think both for sentimental reasons and because it was easier to do something they had done before they brought them out in front of the army behind me and lady and the standard then i ordered the elephants brought forward and spread them on a broad front each supported by ten of our best and most bloodthirsty soldiers it looked like we had a horde of the beasts because their numbers had been tripled by illusion i assumed the shadowmaster would see through the illusions but so what his men would not and it was them i wanted to panic by the time they knew the truth it would be too late cross your fingers croaker ready i asked ready lady said the cavalry withdrew and just in time the shadowmaster had begun to express his ire i gripped ladys hand a moment we leaned together and whispered those three words that everybody gets embarrassed saying in public silly old fart me i felt weird saying them to an audience of one elegies for youth lost when i could say them to anyone and mean it with all my heart and soul for an hour all right murgen lets do it lady and i raised our flaming swords the legions began to chant taglios taglios and my phantom brigade began its advance showmanship all those elephants would have scared the crap out of me if id been over on the other side where the hell did i ever get the idea a general was supposed to lead from the front fewer than a thousand of us going to whip up on fifteen thousand of them arrows came to greet us they did no harm to the illusions they slid off the real elephants they bounced off murgen goblin oneeye lady and me because we were sheltered by protective spells hopefully our opponents would be unsettled by our invulnerability i signalled for an increase in speed the enemy front began to shudder in anticipation of the impact of all those elephants formations started to dissolve about time for the shadowmaster to do something i slowed down the elephants rumbled past trumpeting gaining speed and in a moment all swerving to rush straight at the shadowmaster a hell of an investment just to take out one guy he realized the object of the assault while the elephants were still a hundred yards from him they were going to converge and trample right over him he cut loose with every spell he had ready for ten seconds it seemed like the skies were collapsing and the earth being racked elephants and parts of elephants flew around like childrens toys the whole enemy front was in disarray now i heard the signals ordering the cavalry forward again ordering the infantry to advance the surviving elephants rolled over the spot where the shadowmaster floated a trunk seized him and tossed him thirty feet into the air flailing and tumbling he fell between massive grey flanks screamed flew upward again possibly under his own power a flock of arrows darted at him as the soldiers following the elephants used him for target practice some got through to him he kept spinning off spells like a fireworks show but they seemed purely reflex i laughed and closed in we had the bastard and all his children my record as a general was going to stay unblemished murgen was there when the shadowmaster flipped into the sky for the third time he skewered the sonofabitch with his lance when he came down the shadowmaster screamed gods did he scream he flailed around like a bug impaled on a needle his weight carried him down the shaft of the lance till he hung up on the crosspiece that supports the standard murgen struggled to keep the lance upright and get out of the press our boys were his worst enemies everybody with a bow kept sniping away at the shadowmaster i spurred my mount forward got beside murgen and helped him carry our trophy away that bastard wasnt spinning off any spells now the advancing legions roared their taglios chant twice as loud otto and hagop smashed into the confusion in front of mogabas legion there wasnt quite as much confusion as id hoped the enemy soldiers had realized theyd been snookered though they had not yet gotten into formation again they absorbed the elephant charge and the cavalry charge both taking heavy casualties but they seemed to have given up the idea of running hagop and otto pulled away before the legions arrived but the elephants continued to be mixed in with the foe just as well they were beyond control they had been pricked by enough darts and spearheads and swords to go mad with pain they no longer cared who they stomped i yelled at murgen lets get this over on that mound where everybody can see that we got him one of the mounds that dot the plain was about a hundred yards away we struggled through the oncoming infantry climbed the mound faced the fighting it took both of us to keep the standard upright what with all the kicking and screaming and carrying on the shadowmaster was doing it was a good move tactically carrying him up there his boys could see theyd lost their big weapon at a time when they were getting their asses kicked already and mine could see they didnt have to worry about him anymore they went to work figuring on getting it over with in time for lunch break hagop and otto took the bit in their mouth and circled around the enemy right to get at them from behind i cursed them i did not want them so far away but the thing was beyond control now strategically our move was not the best the boys in the encampment got a whiff of onrushing disaster and decided theyd damned well better do something out they came in a mob their own gimp shadowmaster floating in front slipping and sliding around drunkenly but getting off a couple of killer spells that rattled the armed prisoners cletus and his brothers opened fire from the wall and pounded shadowmaster number two around cut him a little and got him so pissed he stopped everything and turned on them with a spell that blew them and all their engines right off the wall then he led his mob on out looking to cause the rest of us just as much grief his bunch never did get into a formation and neither did the prisoners really so that turned into a sort of barroom brawl with swords real quick the boys at the west gate slid out and hit the camp from behind and got over the wall easily they went to work on the wounded and camp guards and whoever else got in their way but their success did not affect the bigger show the men from the camp just kept after the rest of us i had to do something lets get this thing planted somehow i told murgen i looked out across the chaos before i dismounted i could not see lady anywhere my heart crawled into my throat the earth of that mound was soft and moist grunting and straining the two of us were able to force the butt of the lance in deep enough that it would stand by itself rocking whenever the shadowmaster had a wriggling screaming fit the attack from the flank made progress against the prisoners some of the fainthearted ran for the nearest city gate joining fellows who had not bothered to come out ochiba tried to extend and rotate part of his line to face the onslaught with limited success sindawes less disciplined outfit had begun to disintegrate in their eagerness to hasten the demise of the enemies they faced they were unaware of the threat from the right only mogaba had maintained discipline and unit integrity if id had half a brain id have flipflopped his legion with ochibas before we started this out where he was now he wasnt much use killing off the entire enemy right wing sure but not keeping everything else from falling apart i had a bad feeling it was going sour i dont know what to do murgen i dont think theres anything you can do now croaker except cross your fingers and play it out fireworks spewed over in ochibas area for a while they were so ferocious i thought they might halt the coming collapse there goblin and oneeye were on the job but the crippled shadowmaster managed to quiet them down what could i throw at him what could i do nothing i didnt have anything else to send in i did not want to watch a solitary crow settled onto the writhing shadowmaster impaled on the standard lance it looked at him at me at the fighting and made a sound like an amused chuckle then it began pecking at the shadowmasters mask trying to get at his eyes i ignored the bird men began to scurry past they were from sindawes legion mostly prisoners who had been enrolled the past few days i yelled at them and cursed them and called them cowards and ordered them to turn around and form up mostly they did hagop and otto attacked the men facing ochiba probably hoping to ease the pressure so he could go ahead and deal with the threat from the camp but the attack from behind impelled the enemy forward while otto and hagops bunch were having a great time the men they were butchering cracked ochibas line and ran into the armed prisoners from the side ochibas legion tried to hold even so but they looked like they were in bad trouble sindawes men thought they were about to run and decided to beat them in a footrace or something they collapsed mogaba had begun rotating his axis of attack to support sindawe from the flank but when he finished there was nothing to support in moments his legion was the only island of order in a sea of chaos the enemy were no more organized than my people were the thing was a grand mess the worlds largest brawl more of my people ran for the city gates some just ran i stood there under the standard cussing and yelling and waving my sword and shedding a couple of quarts of tears and gods help me some of the fools heard and listened and started trying to form up with the men id organized already facing around pushing back into it in tight little detachments guts from the beginning they had told me those taglians had guts more and more me and murgen built us a human wall around the standard more and more the enemy concentrated on mogaba whose legion refused to break the shadowmasters men heaped their dead around him he did not see us it seemed despite all resistance he moved toward the city i guess murgen and i got three thousand men together before fate decided it was time to take another bite a big mob of the enemy rushed us i assumed my pose with my sword up beside the standard i did not have much show left me if goblin and oneeye were alive at all they were too busy covering their own asses it looked like we would drive them off easily our line was locked together solidly they were just a howling mob then the arrow came out of nowhere and hit me square in the chest and knocked me right off my horse chapter fortyone lady it wasnt always best to be old and wise in the ways of battlefields lady thought she saw what was coming clearly long before anybody else did briefly after murgen skewered the shadowmaster she had hopes it would turn but the advent of the troops from the encampment caused a shift in momentum that could not be reversed croaker should not have attacked he should have waited as long as it took made them come to him not been so concerned about the shadowmasters if he had allowed the new army from the south to come forward and get in the way of the men from the encampment he could have then hurled his elephants in without risk to his right but it was too late to weep about mighthavebeens it was time to try rooting out a miracle one shadowmaster was out and the other was crippled if only she had a tenth even a hundredth of the power she had lost if only shed had time to nurture and channel the little bit that had begun coming back to her if only if only all life was if only where was that damned imp of oneeyes it could turn this around there was nobody on the other side to keep it from going through those men like a scythe at least for long enough but frogface was nowhere to be seen oneeye and goblin were working as a team doing their little bit to stem the tide frogface was not with them they seemed too busy to be curious about that the imps absence was too important to be accident or oversight why at this critical juncture no time no time to brood about it and slither down through all the shadows and try to find the meaning of the imps presences and absences which had been bothering her so long only time to realize with certainty that the creature had been planted upon oneeye and wasnt his to command at all by whom not the shadowmasters the shadowmasters would have used the imp directly not shifter hed had no need not the howler he would have gotten his revenge what else was loose in the world a crow flapped past it cawed in a way that made her think it was laughing croaker and his crows he had been muttering about crows for a year and then they had started turning up around him any time anything big happened she glanced at the mound where croaker and murgen had set the standard croaker had a pair of crows perched on his shoulders a flock circled above him he made a dramatic figure there in his widowmaker disguise with the doombirds wheeling around him waving his fiery sword trying to rally his crumbling legions while the mind pursued one clatch of enemies the body dealt with another she wielded her weapons with a dancers grace and the deadliness of a demigoddess at first there had been an exhilaration realizing she was approaching a state she had not achieved in ages except by the path of its tantric cousin last night and then she went over into the perfect calm the mystic separation of self and flesh that actually melded into a greater more illuminated and deadly whole there was no fear in that state nor any other emotion it was like being in the deepest meditation where the self wandered a field of glimmering insights yet the flesh performed its deadly tasks with a precision and perfection that left the dead mounded about her and her terrible mount the enemy wrestled with one another to stay away from her her allies fought to get into the safety of the vacuum surrounding her though the right wing had begun to collapse one stubborn rock formed the self reflected on memories of illuminations won during the night from a pair of bodies sweating straining together on her absolute amazement during and after her life had been one of absolute selfcontrol yet time and again the flesh had gone beyond any hope of control at her age and she looked at croaker again now harried by his enemies and the shadow crept into the killing perfection and showed her why she had denied herself for so long she thought of loss and loss mattered mattering intruded upon the self distracting it it wanted to take control of the flesh to force things to transpire according to its desires she started forcing her way toward croaker the knot of men around her moving with her but the enemy could sense that she was no longer the terrible thing she had been that she was now vulnerable they pressed in one by one her companions fell then she saw the arrow strike croaker and drop him at the foot of the standard she shrieked and spurred her mount over friend and foe alike her pain and her rage only carried her into a mass of enemies who attacked from every direction she cut some but others dragged her off her rearing steed and harried the beast away she fought with skill and desperation against poorly trained opponents but the ineptness of her enemies was not enough she heaped bodies but they drove her down to her knees a wave of chaos swept over that fight within the battle men fleeing men pursuing and when it passed all that could be seen of her was one arm protruding from a pile of corpses chapter fortytwo that stump lying mostly on my back clinging to the haft of the lance with my left hand the standard flapping and the shadowmaster flopping overhead i dont think the arrow hit anything vital but the sonofabitch went through my breastplate and me too i think there are a couple inches sticking out in back what the hell happened to the spells protecting me i never been hit this bad before coupla crows up with the shadowmaster amusing themselves trying to get his eyes four or five prowling around down here not bothering me act like theyre standing guard bunch showed up a while ago when some enemy troops came after the standard piled all over them till they went away ah that damned arrow hurts can i get a hand around there and break the shaft pull the sucker back out after the head is gone better not the shaft might be keeping the bleeding from getting too bad inside seen that happen whats going on cant move enough to look around hurts too much all i can see from here is the plain covered with bodies elephants horses some men in white a lot more not i think we took a lot of them with us i think if the formations had just held up wed have kicked their asses cant hear total silence me what was that silence of stone where did i hear that tired so damned tired want to lay down and sleep cant the arrow probably be too weak soon though thirsty but not thirsty like with a belly wound thank the gods never wanted to die with a gut wound ha never wanted to die keep thinking about sepsis what if the bowman put garlic or feces on his arrowheads blood poisoning gangrene smell like youre six days dead when youre still breathing cant amputate my chest shame and guilt brought the company to this didnt want to be the last captain guess none of them did shouldnt have fought today sure shouldnt have charged thought the illusions and elephants would be enough though came close too know what i should have done now stayed up in the hills where they couldnt see me and let them come to me could have sneaked around and used the old company trickery on them there show the standard in one direction and attack from another but i had to come down here after them feel like a fool lying here in my underwear and a breastplate wonder if it did any damn good for murgen to put that widowmaker suit on and go try to turn the tide mogaba will have his cojones for abandoning the standard but im here still holding the sucker up maybe somebody will come before i pass out getting so even somebody from the other side would look good damned arrow finish it off get it over something moving just my damned horse having lunch turning grass into horse hockey just another day in the life for him go fetch me a bucket of beer you bastard youre supposed to be so damned intelligent why cant you get a dying man a last beer how can the world be so damned quiet and bright and cheerfullooking when so many men just died here look at that mess right down there fifty dead guys in a patch of wildflowers going to smell the stink for forty miles in a couple days how come this is taking so long am i going to be one of those guys who makes a career out of croaking something out there something moving way out crows circling my old friend the stump crossing the plain of the dead on a holiday stroll stepping light though in a good mood what was that before not yet time crows this critter death i been looking my own death in the eye all the way down here carrying something yeah a box about a foot by a foot by a foot remember noticing that before but not paying much attention never heard of death carrying a box usually a sword or a scythe whatever the hell it is its here to see me headed straight for me hang in there croaker maybe theres new hope for the dead geek up on the lance getting all bent out of shape i dont think hes happy about developments getting closer now definitely no walking stump a people or something walking on two legs very short funny always looked bigger from a distance close enough now we ought to be eyeball to eyeball if i could see any eyes inside that hood its like theres nothing in there at all kneeling empty hood yes inches away damned box right beside me voice like a very slight breath of a breeze in spring willows soft gentle and merry now its time croaker half a titter half a chuckle a glance up at the critter skewered on the lance and its time for you too you old bastard completely different voice not just a different tone or a different inflexion but an entirely different voice i guess all the other dead ones being alive set me up for it i recognized her instantly almost as if something inside me had been expecting her i gasped you that cant be i tried to get up soulcatcher i dont know what the hell i thought i was going to do run away how where to the pain ripped through me i sagged yes my love me you went away without finishing it laughter that was a young girls giggle i have waited a long time croaker but she finally exchanged the magic words with you now i avenge myself by taking from her what is more precious than life itself again the giggle like she was talking about some simple practical joke with no malice in it i had no strength to argue she made a lifting gesture with one gloved hand come along my sweet i floated up off the ground a crow landed on my chest and stared off in the direction i began to move as though it were in charge of navigation there was a good side the pain faded i did not see the lance and its burden move but sensed that it too was in motion my captor led the way floating too we moved very fast we must have been a sight for anyone watching darkness nibbled around the edge of consciousness i fought it fearing it was the final darkness i lost chapter fortythree overlook mad laughter rolled out of that high crystal room on top of that tower at overlook somebody was tickled silly about the way things were going up north thats three of them down half a job done and the hard half at that get the other three and its all mine more insane mirth the shadowmaster gazed out at the brilliant expanse of whiteness is it time to release you from your prison my beauties of the night time to let you run free in the world again no no not just this moment not till this island of safety is invulnerable
