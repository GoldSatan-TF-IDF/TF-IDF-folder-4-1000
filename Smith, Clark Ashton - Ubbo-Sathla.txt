paul tregardis found the milky crystal in a litter of oddments from many lands and eras he had entered the shop of the curiodealer through an aimless impulse with no particular object in mind other than the idle distraction of eyeing and fingering a miscellany of fargathered things looking desultorily about his attention had been drawn by a dull glimmering on one of the tables and he had extricated the queer orblike stone from its shadowy crowded position between an ugly little aztec idol the fossil egg of a dinornis and an obscene fetich of black wood from the niger the thing was about the size of a small orange and was slightly flattened at the ends like a planet at its poles it puzzled tregardis for it was not like an ordinary crystal being cloudy and changeable with an intermittent glowing in its heart as if it were alternately illumed and darkened from within holding it to the wintry window he studied it for awhile without being able to determine the secret of this singular and regular alternation his puzzlement was soon complicated by a dawning sense of vague and irrecognizable familiarity as if he had seen the thing before under circumstances that were now wholly forgotten he appealed to the curiodealer a dwarfish hebrew with an air of dusty antiquity who gave the impression of being lost to commercial considerations in some web of cabbalistic revery can you tell me anything about this the dealer gave an indescribable simultaneous shrug of his shoulders and his eyebrows it is very oldpalaeogean one might say i cannot tell you much for little is known a geologist found it in greenland beneath glacial ice in the miocene strata who knows it may have belonged to some sorcerer of primeval thule greenland was a warm fertile region beneath the sun of miocene times no doubt it is a magic crystal and a man might behold strange visions in its heart if he looked long enough tregardis was quite startled for the dealers apparently fantastic suggestion had brought to mind his own delvings in a branch of obscure lore and in particular had recalled the book of eibon that strangest and rarest of occult forgotten volumes which is said to have come down through a series of manifold translations from a prehistoric original written in the lost language of hyperborea tregardis with much difficulty had obtained the medieval french versiona copy that had been owned by many generations of sorcerers and satanistsbut had never been able to find the greek manuscript from which the version was derived the remote fabulous original was supposed to have been the work of a great hyperborean wizard from whom it had taken its name it was a collection of dark and baleful myths of liturgies rituals and incantations both evil and esoteric not without shudders in the course of studies that the average person would have considered more than singular tregardis had collated the french volume with the frightful necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred he had found many correspondences of the blackest and most appalling significance together with much forbidden data that was either unknown to the arab or omitted by him or by his translators was this what he had been trying to recall tregardis wondered the brief casual reference in the book of eibon to a cloudy crystal that had been owned by the wizard zon mezzamalech in mhu thulan of course it was all too fantastic too hypothetic too incrediblebut mhu thulan that northern portion of ancient hyperborea was supposed to have corresponded roughly with modem greenland which had formerly been joined as a peninsula to the main continent could the stone in his hand by some fabulous fortuity be the crystal of zon mezzamalech tregardis smiled at himself with inward irony for even conceiving the absurd notion such things did not occurat least not in presentday london and in all likelihood the book of eibon was sheer superstitious fantasy anyway nevertheless there was something about the crystal that continued to tease and inveigle him he ended by purchasing it at a fairly moderate price the sum was named by the seller and paid by the buyer without bargaining with the crystal in his pocket paul tregardis hastened back to his lodgings instead of resuming his leisurely saunter he installed the milky globe on his writing table where it stood firmly enough on one of its oblate ends then still smiling at his own absurdity he took down the yellow parchment manuscript of the book of eibon from its place in a somewhat inclusive collection of recherch–π literature he opened the vermiculated leather cover with hasps of tarnished steel and read over to himself translating from the archaic french as he read the paragraph that referred to zon mezzamalech this wizard who was mighty among sorcerers had found a cloudy stone orblike and somewhat flattened at the ends in which he could behold many visions of the terrene past even to the earths beginning when ubbosathla the unbegotten source lay vast and swollen and yeasty amid the vaporing slime but of that which he beheld zon mezzamalech left little record and people say that he vanished presently in a way that is not known and after him the cloudy crystal was lost paul tregardis laid the manuscript aside again there was something that tantalized and beguiled him like a lost dream or a memory forfeit to oblivion impelled by a feeling which he did not scrutinize or question he sat down before the table and began to stare intently into the cold nebulous orb he felt an expectation which somehow was so familiar so permeative a part of his consciousness that he did not even name it to himself minute by minute he sat and watched the alternate glimmering and fading of the mysterious light in the heart of the crystal by imperceptible degrees there stole upon him a sense of dreamlike duality both in respect to his person and his surroundings he was still paul tregardisand yet he was someone else the room was his london apartmentand a chamber in some foreign but wellknown place and in both milieus he peered steadfastly into the same crystal after an interim without surprise on the part of tregardis the process of reidentification became complete he knew that he was zon mezzamalech a sorcerer of mhu thulan and a student of all lore anterior to his own epoch wise with dreadful secrets that were not known to paul tregardis amateur of anthropology and the occult sciences in latterday london he sought by means of the milky crystal to attain an even older and more fearful knowledge he had acquired the stone in dubitable ways from a more than sinister source it was unique and without fellow in any land or time in its depths all former years all things that have ever been were supposedly mirrored and would reveal themselves to the patient visionary and through the crystal zon mezzamalech had dreamt to recover the wisdom of the gods who died before the earth was born they had passed to the lightless void leaving their lore inscribed upon tablets of ultrastellar stone and the tablets were guarded in the primal mire by the formless idiotic demiurge ubbosathla only by means of the crystal could he hope to find and read the tablets for the first time he was making trial of the globes reputed virtues about him an ivorypanelled chamber filled with his magic books and paraphernalia was fading slowly from his consciousness before him on a table of some dark hyperborean wood that had been graven with grotesque ciphers the crystal appeared to swell and deepen and in its filmy depth he beheld a swift and broken swirling of dim scenes fleeting like the bubbles of a millrace as if he looked upon an actual world cities forests mountains seas and meadows flowed beneath him lightening and darkening as with the passage of days and nights in some weirdly accelerated stream of time zon mezzamalech had forgotten paul tregardishad lost the remembrance of his own entity and his own surroundings in mhu thulan moment by moment the flowing vision in the crystal became more definite and distinct and the orb itself deepened till he grew giddy as if he were peering from an insecure height into some neverfathomed abyss he knew that time was racing backward in the crystal was unrolling for him the pageant of all past days but a strange alarm had seized him and he feared to gaze longer like one who has nearly fallen from a precipice he caught himself with a violent start and drew back from the mystic orb again to his gaze the enormous whirling world into which he had peered was a small and cloudy crystal on his runewrought table in mhu thulan then by degrees it seemed that the great room with sculptured panels of mammoth ivory was narrowing to another and dingier place and zon mezzamalech losing his preternatural wisdom and sorcerous power went back by a weird regression into paul tregardis and yet not wholly it seemed was he able to return tregardis dazed and wondering found himself before the writing table on which he had set the oblate sphere he felt the confusion of one who has dreamt and has not yet fully awakened from the dream the room puzzled him vaguely as if something were wrong with its size and furnishings and his remembrance of purchasing the crystal from a curiodealer was oddly and discrepantly mingled with an impression that he had acquired it in a very different manner he felt that something very strange had happened to him when he peered into the crystal but just what it was he could not seem to recollect it had left him in the sort of psychic muddlement that follows a debauch of hashish he assured himself that he was paul tregardis that he lived on a certain street in london that the year was but such commonplace verities had somehow lost their meaning and their validity and everything about him was shadowlike and insubstantial the very walls seemed to waver like smoke the people in the streets were phantoms of phantoms and he himself was a lost shadow a wandering echo of something long forgot he resolved that he would not repeat his experiment of crystalgazing the effects were too unpleasant and equivocal but the very next day by an unreasoning impulse to which he yielded almost mechanically without reluctation he found himself seated before the misty orb again he became the sorcerer zon mezzamalech in mhu thulan again he dreamt to retrieve the wisdom of the antemundane gods again he drew back from the deepening crystal with the terror of one who fears to fall and once morebut doubtfully and dimly like a failing wraithhe was paul tregardis three times did tregardis repeat the experience on successive days and each time his own person and the world about him became more tenuous and confused than before his sensations were those of a dreamer who is on the verge of waking and london itself was unreal as the lands that slip from the dreamers ken receding in filmy mist and cloudy light beyond it all he felt the looming and crowding of vast imageries alien but halffamiliar it was as if the phantasmagoria of time and space were dissolving about him to reveal some veritable realityor another dream of space and time there came at last the day when he sat down before the crystaland did not return as paul tregardis it was the day when zon mezzamalech boldly disregarding certain evil and portentous warnings resolved to overcome his curious fear of failing bodily into the visionary world that he behelda fear that had hitherto prevented him from following the backward stream of time for any distance he must he assured himself conquer this fear if he were ever to see and read the lost tablets of the gods he had beheld nothing more than a few fragments of the years of mhu thulan immediately posterior to the presentthe years of his own lifetime and there were inestimable cycles between these years and the beginning again to his gaze the crystal deepened immeasurably with scenes and happenings that flowed in a retrograde stream again the magic ciphers of the dark table faded from his ken and the sorcerously carven walls of his chamber melted into less than dream once more he grew giddy with an awful vertigo as he bent above the swirling and milling of the terrible gulfs of time in the worldlike orb fearfully in spite of his resolution he would have drawn away but he had looked and leaned too long there was a sense of abysmal falling a suction as of ineluctable winds of maelstroms that bore him down through fleet unstable visions of his own past life into antenatal years and dimensions he seemed to endure the pangs of an inverse dissolution and then he was no longer zon mezzamalech the wise and learned watcher of the crystal but an actual part of the weirdly racing stream that ran back to reattain the beginning he seemed to live unnumbered lives to die myriad deaths forgetting each time the death and life that had gone before he fought as a warrior in halflegendary battles he was a child playing in the ruins of some olden city of mhu thulan he was the king who had reigned when the city was in its prime the prophet who had foretold its building and its doom a woman he wept for the bygone dead in necropoli longcrumbled an antique wizard he muttered the rude spells of earlier sorcery a priest of some prehuman god he wielded the sacrificial knife in cavetemples of pillared basalt life by life era by era he retraced the long and groping cycles through which hyperborea had risen from savagery to a high civilization he became a barbarian of some troglodytic tribe fleeing from the slow turreted ice of a former glacial age into lands illumed by the ruddy flare of perpetual volcanoes then after incomputable years he was no longer man but a manlike beast roving in forests of giant fern and calamite or building an uncouth nest in the boughs of mighty cycads through aeons of anterior sensation of crude lust and hunger of aboriginal terror and madness there was someoneor somethingthat went ever backward in time death became birth and birth was death in a slow vision of reverse change the earth appeared to melt away and sloughed off the hills and mountains of its latter strata always the sun grew larger and hotter above the fuming swamps that teemed with a crasser life with a more fulsome vegetation and the thing that had been paul tregardis that had been zon mezzamalech was a part of all the monstrous devolution it flew with the clawtipped wings of a pterodactyl it swam in tepid seas with the vast winding bulk of an ichthyosaurus it bellowed uncouthly with the armored throat of some forgotten behemoth to the huge moon that burned through primordial mists at length after aeons of immemorial brutehood it became one of the lost serpentmen who reared their cities of black gneiss and fought their venomous wars in the worlds first continent it walked undulously in antehuman streets in strange crooked vaults it peered at primeval stars from high babelian towers it bowed with hissing litanies to great serpentidols through years and ages of the ophidian era it returned and was a thing that crawled in the ooze that had not yet learned to think and dream and build and the time came when there was no longer a continent but only a vast chaotic marsh a sea of slime without limit or horizon without shore or elevation that seethed with a blind writhing of amorphous vapors there in the grey beginning of earth the formless mass that was ubbosathla reposed amid the slime and the vapors headless without organs or members it sloughed from its oozy sides in a slow ceaseless wave the amoebic forms that were the archetypes of earthly life horrible it was if there had been aught to apprehend the horror and loathsome if there had been any to feel loathing about it prone or tilted in the mire there lay the mighty tablets of starquarried stone that were writ with the inconceivable wisdom of the premundane gods and there to the goal of a forgotten search was drawn the thing that had beenor would sometime bepaul tregardis and zon mezzamalech becoming a shapeless eft of the prime it crawled sluggishly and obliviously across the fallen tablets of the gods and fought and ravened blindly with the other spawn of ubbosathla
