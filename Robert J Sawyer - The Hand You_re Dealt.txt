got a new case for you said my boss raymond chen homicide my heart started pounding mendelia habitat is supposed to be a utopia murder is almost unheard of here chen was fat never exercised loved rich foods he knew his lifestyle would take decades off his life but hey that was his choice somebody offed a soothsayer over in wheel four he said wheezing slightly baranskis on the scene now my eyebrows went up a dead soothsayer this could be very interesting indeed i took my pocket forensic scanner and exited the cop shop that was its real name no taxes in mendelia after all you needed a cop you hired one in this case chen had said we were being paid by the soothsayers guild that meant we could run up as big a bill as necessary the sg was stinking rich one of the few laws in mendelia was that everyone had to use soothsayers mendelia consisted of five modules each looking like a wagon wheel with spokes leading in to a central hub the hubs were all joined together by a long axle and separate travel tubes connected the outer edges of the wheels the whole thing spun to simulate gravity out at the rims and the travel tubes saved you having to go down to the zerog of the axle to move from one wheel to the next the cop shop was in wheel two all the wheel rims were hollow with buildings growing up toward the axle from the outer interior wall plenty of open spaces in mendelia it wouldnt be much of a utopia without those but our sky was a hologram projected on the convex inner wall of the rim above our heads the cop shops entrance was right by wheel twos transit loop a series of maglev tracks along which robocabs ran i hailed one flashed my debit card at an unblinking eye and the cab headed out the carling family who owned the taxi concession was one of the oldest and richest families in mendelia the ride took fifteen minutes suzanne baranski was waiting outside for me she was a good cop but too green to handle a homicide alone still shed get a big cut of the fee for being the original responding officer after all the cop who responds to a call never knows who if anyone is going to pick up the tab when there is money to be had firstresponders get a disproportionate share id worked with suze a couple of times before and had even gone to see her play cello with the symphony once perfect example of what mendelias all about that suze baranski had bluecollar parents theyd worked as welders on the building of wheel five not the kind whod normally send a daughter for music lessons but just after shed been born their soothsayer had said that suze had musical talent not enough to make a living at it thats why shes a cop by day but still sufficient that it would be a shame not to let her develop it hi toby suze said to me she had short red hair and big green eyes and of course was in plain clothes you wanted a uniformed cop you called our competitors spitpolish inc howdy suze i said walking toward her she led me over to the door which had been locked off in the open position a holographic sign next to it proclaimed skye hissock soothsayer let me reveal your future fully qualified for infant and adult readings we stepped into a wellappointed lobby the art was unusual for such an office it was all original penandink political cartoons there was republic ceo da silva her big nose exaggerated out of all proportion and next to it axel durmont earths current president half buried in legislation printouts and tape that doubtless would have been red had this been a color rendering the artists signature caught my eye the name skye with curving lines behind it that i realized were meant to represent clouds just like suze our decedent had had varied talents the body is in the inner private office said suze leading the way that door too was already open she stepped in first and i followed skye hissocks body sat in a chair behind his desk his head had been blown clean off a great carnation bloom of blood covered most of the wall behind him and chunks of brain were plastered to the wall and the credenza behind the desk christ i said some utopia suze nodded blaster obviously she said sounding much more experienced in such matters than she really was probably a gigawatt charge i began looking around the room it was opulent old skye had obviously done well for himself suze was poking around too hey she said after a moment i turned to look at her she was climbing up on the credenza the blast had knocked a small piece of sculpture off the wall it lay in two pieces on the floor and she was examining where it had been affixed thought thats what it was she said nodding theres a hidden camera here my heart skipped a beat you dont suppose he got the whole thing on disk do you i said moving over to where she was i gave her a hand getting down off the credenza and we opened it up a slightly difficult task crusted blood had sealed its sliding doors inside was a dusty recorder unit i turned to skyes desk and pushed the release switch to pop up his monitor plate suze pushed the recorders playback button as wed suspected the unit was designed to feed into the desk monitor the picture showed the reverse angle from behind skyes desk the door to the private office opened and in came a young man he looked to be eighteen meaning he was just the right age for the mandatory adult soothsaying he had shoulder length dirtyblond hair and was wearing a tshirt imprinted with the logo of a popular meed i shook my head there hadnt been a good multimedia band since the cassies if you ask me hello dale said what must have been skyes voice he spoke with deep slightly nasal tones thank you for coming in okay we had the guys picture and his first name and the name of his favorite meed even if dales last name didnt turn up in skyes appointment computer we should have no trouble tracking him down as you know said skyes recorded voice the law requires two soothsayings in each persons life the first is done just after youre born with one or both of your parents in attendance at that time the soothsayer only tells them things theyll need to know to get you through childhood but when you turn eighteen you not your parents become legally responsible for all your actions and so its time you heard everything now do you want the good news or the bad news first here it comes i thought he told dale something he didnt want to hear the guy flipped pulled out a blaster and blew him away dale swallowed the the good i guess all right said skye first youre a bright young man not a genius you understand but brighter than average your iq should run between and you are gifted musically did your parents tell you that good i hope they encouraged you they did said dale nodding ive had piano lessons since i was four good good a crime to waste such raw talent you also have a particular aptitude for mathematics thats often paired with musical ability of course so no surprises there your visual memory is slightly better than average although your ability to do rote memorization is slightly worse you would make a good longdistance runner but i motioned for suze to hit the fastforward button it seemed like a typical soothsaying although id review it in depth later if need be poor dale fidgeted up and down in quadruple speed for a time then suze released the button now said skyes voice the bad news i made an impressed face at suze shed stopped speeding along at precisely the right moment im afraid theres a lot of it nothing devastating but still lots of little things you will begin to lose your hair around your twentyseventh birthday and it will begin to gray by the time youre thirtytwo by the age of forty you will be almost completely bald and whats left at that point will be half brown and half gray on a less frivolous note youll also be prone to gaining weight starting at about age thirtythree and youll put on half a kilo a year for each of the following thirty years if youre not careful by the time youre in your midfifties that will pose a significant health hazard youre also highly likely to develop adultonset diabetes now yes that can be cured but the cure is expensive and youll have to pay for it so either keep your weight down which will help stave off its onset or start saving now for the operation i shrugged nothing worth killing a man over suze fastforwarded the tape some more and thats it concluded skye you know now everything significant thats coded into your dna use this information wisely and you should have a long happy healthy life dale thanked skye took a printout of the information hed just heard and left the recording stopped it had been too much to hope for whoever killed skye hissock had come in after young dale had departed he was still our obvious first suspect but unless there was something awful in the parts of the genetic reading wed fastforwarded over there didnt seem to be any motive for him to kill his soothsayer and besides this dale had a high iq skye had said only an idiot would think there was any sense in shooting the messenger after wed finished watching the recording i did an analysis of the actual blaster burn no fun that standing over the open top of skyes torso most of the blood vessels had been cauterized by the charge still blasters were only manufactured in two places i knew of tokyo on earth and new monty if the one used here had been made on new monty wed be out of luck but one of earths countless laws required all blasters to leave a characteristic em signature so they could be traced to their registered owners and good it was an earthmade blaster i recorded the signature then used my compad to relay it to the cop shop if raymond chen could find some time between stuffing his face hed send an ftl message to earth and check the pattern assuming of course that the jeffies dont scramble the message just for kicks meanwhile i told suze to go over hissocks client list while i started checking out his family fact is even though it doesnt make much genetic sense most people are killed by their own relatives skye hissock had been fiftyone hed been a soothsayer for twentythree years ever since finishing his phd in genetics he was unmarried and both his parents were long dead but he did have a brother named rodger rodger was married to rebecca connolly and they had two children glen who like dale in skyes recording had just turned eighteen and billy who was eight there are no inheritance taxes in mendelia of course so barring a will to the contrary hissocks estate would pass immediately to his brother normally thatd be a good motive for murder but rodger hissock and rebecca connolly were already quite rich they owned a controlling interest in the company that operated mendelias atmosphererecycling plant i decided to start my interviews with rodger not only had brothers been killing each other since cain wasted abel but the fingerprint lock a standard tenpointsofcomparison model on skyes private inner office was programmed to recognize only four people skye himself his office cleaner who suze was going to talk to another soothsayer named jennifer halasz who sometimes took skyes patients for him when he was on vacation and who had called in the murder having stopped by apparently to meet skye for coffee and dear brother rodger rodger lived in wheel four and worked in one i took a cab over to his office unlike skye rodger had a real fleshandblood receptionist most companies that did have human receptionists used middleaged businesslike people of either sex some guys got so rich that they didnt care what people thought they hired beautiful blonde women whose busts had been surgically altered far beyond what any phenotype might provide but rodgers choice was different his receptionist was a delicate young man with refined almost feminine features he was probably older than he looked he looked fourteen detective toby korsakov i said flashing my id i didnt offer to shake hands the boy looked like his would shatter if any pressure were applied id like to see rodger hissock do you have an appointment his voice was high and there was just a trace of a lisp no but im sure mr hissock will want to see me its important the boy looked very dubious but he spoke into an intercom theres a cop here rodger says its important there was a pause send him in said a loud voice the boy nodded at me and i walked through the heavy wooden door mahogany no doubt imported all the way from earth i had thought skye hissocks office was wellappointed but his brothers put it to shame objets dart from a dozen worlds were tastefully displayed on crystal stands the carpet was so thick i was sure my shoes would sink out of sight i walked toward the desk rodger rose to greet me he was a muscular man thicknecked with lots of black hair and pale gray eyes we shook hands his grip was a show of macho strength hello he said he boomed out the word clearly a man used to commanding everyones attention what can i do for you please sit down i said my name is toby korsakov im from the cop shop working under a contract to the soothsayers guild my god said rodger has something happened to skye although it was an unpleasant duty there was nothing more useful in a murder investigation than being there to tell a suspect about the death and seeing his reaction most guilty parties played dumb far too long so the fact that rodger had quickly made the obvious connection between the sg and his brother made me suspect him less not more still im sorry to be the bearer of bad news i said but im afraid your brother is dead rodgers eyes went wide what happened he was murdered murdered repeated rodger as if hed never heard the word before thats right i was wondering if you knew of anyone whod want him dead how was he killed asked rodger i was irritated that this wasnt an answer to my question and even more irritated that id have to explain it so soon more than a few homicides had been solved by a suspect mentioning the nature of the crime in advance of him or her supposedly having learned the details he was shot at close range by a blaster oh said rodger he slumped in his chair skye dead his head shook back and forth a little when he looked up his gray eyes were moist whether he was faking or not i couldnt tell im sorry i said do you know who did it not yet were tracing the blasters em signature but there were no signs of forcible entry and well yes well there are only four people whose fingerprints opened the door to skyes inner office rodger nodded me and skye who else his cleaner and another soothsayer youre checking them out my associate is shes also checking all the people skye had appointments with recently people he might have let in of his own volition a pause can i ask where you were this morning between ten and eleven here in your office thats right your receptionist can vouch for that well no no he cant he was out all morning his sooth says hes got a facility for languages i give him a halfday off every wednesday to take french lessons did anyone call you while he was gone rodger spread his thick arms oh probably but i never answer my own compad truth to tell i like that halfday where i cant be reached it lets me get an enormous amount of work done without being interrupted so no one can verify your presence here well no no i guess they cant but crissakes detective skye was my brother im not accusing you mr hissock besides if id taken a robocab over thered be a debit charge against my account unless you paid cash or unless you walked you can walk down the travel tubes although most people dont bother you dont seriously believe i dont believe anything yet mr hissock it was time to change the subject he would be no use to me if he got too defensive was your brother a good soothsayer best there is hell he read my own sooth when i turned eighteen he saw my eyebrows go up skye is nine years older than me i figured why not use him he needed the business he was just starting his practice at that point did skye do the readings for your children too an odd hesitation well yeah yeah skye did their infant readings but glen thats my oldest just turned he decided to go somewhere else for his adult reading waste of money if you ask me skye wouldve given him a discount my compad bleeped while i was in a cab i turned it on yo toby raymond chens fat face appeared on the screen we got the registration information on that blaster signature yeah ray smiled do the words openandshut case mean anything to you the blaster belongs to one rodger hissock he bought it about eleven years ago i nodded and signed off since the lock accepted his fingerprint rich little brother would have no trouble waltzing right into big brothers inner office and exploding his head rodger had method and he had opportunity now all i needed was to find his motive and for that continuing to interview the family members might prove useful eighteenyearold glen hissock was studying engineering at francis crick university in wheel three he was a dead ringer for his old man built like a wrestler with black hair and quicksilver eyes but whereas father rodger had a coarse outgoing way about him the crusher handshake the loud voice young glen was withdrawn softspoken and nervous im sorry about your uncle i said knowing that rodger had already broken the news to his son glen looked at the floor me too did you like him he was okay just okay yeah where were you between ten and eleven this morning at home was anyone else there nah mom and dad were at work and billy thats my little brother was in school he met my eyes for the first time am i a suspect he wasnt really all the evidence seemed to point to his father i shook my head in response to his question then said i hear you had your sooth read recently yeah but you didnt use your uncle nah how come a shrug just felt funny thats all i picked a guy at random from the online directory any surprises in your sooth the boy looked at me sooths private man i dont have to tell you that i nodded sorry two hundred years ago in the palo alto nanosystems laboratory developed a molecular computer you doubtless read about it in history class during the snow war the us used it to disassemble bogatб atom by atom sometimes though you can put the genie back in the bottle remember hamasaki and dejong the two researchers at panl who were shocked to see their work corrupted that way they created and released the nanogorts selfreplicating microscopic machines that seek out and destroy molecular computers so that nothing like bogatб could ever happen again weve got panl nanogorts here of course theyre everywhere in free space but weve got another kind of molecular guardian too inevitably they were dubbed helixgorts its rumored the sg was responsible for them but after a huge investigation no indictments were ever brought helixgorts circumvent any attempt at artificial gene therapy we can tell you everything thats written in your dna but we cant do a damned thing about it here in mendelia you play the hand youre dealt my compad bleeped again i switched it on korsakov here suzes face appeared on the screen hi toby i took a sample of skyes dna off to rundstedt a soothsayer who did forensic work for us shes finished the reading and i said suzes green eyes blinked nothing stood out skye wouldnt have been a compulsive gambler or an addict or inclined to steal another persons spouse which eliminates several possible motives for his murder in fact rundstedt says skye would have had a severe aversion to confrontation she sighed just doesnt seem to be the kind of guy whod end up in a situation where someone would want him dead i nodded thanks suze any luck with skyes clients ive gone through almost all the ones whod had appointments in the last three days so far they all have solid alibis keep checking im off to see skyes sisterinlaw rebecca connolly talk to you later bye sometimes i wonder if im in the right line of work i know i know what a crazy thing to be thinking i mean my parents knew from my infant reading that id grow up to have an aptitude for puzzlesolving plus superior powers of observation they made sure i had every opportunity to fulfill my potentials and when i had my sooth read for myself at eighteen it was obvious that this would be a perfect job for me to pursue and yet still i have my doubts i just dont feel like a cop sometimes but a soothsaying cant be wrong almost every human trait has a genetic basis gullibility meanspiritedness a goofy sense of humor the urge to collect things talents for various sports every specific sexual predilection according to my own sooth my tastes ran to group sex with asian women so far id yet to find an opportunity to test that empirically of course when mendelia started up we didnt yet know what each gene and gene combo did even today the sg is still adding new interpretations to the list still i sometimes wonder how people in other parts of free space get along without soothsayers stumbling through life looking for the right job sometimes completely unaware of talents they possess failing to know what specific things they should do to take care of their health oh sure you can get a genetic reading anywhere even down on earth but theyre only mandatory here and my mandatory readings said id make a good cop but i have to admit sometimes im not so sure rebecca connolly was at home when i got there on earth a family with the kind of money the hissockconnolly union had would own a mansion space is at a premium aboard a habitat but their living room was big enough that its floor showed a hint of curvature the art on the walls included originals by both grant wood and bob eggleton there was no doubt they were loaded making it all the harder to believe theyd done in uncle skye for his money rebecca connolly was a gorgeous woman according to the press reports id read she was fortyfour but she looked twenty years younger gene therapy might be impossible here but anyone who could afford it could have plastic surgery her hair was coppercolored and her eyes an unnatural violet hello detective korsakov she said my husband told me you were likely to stop by she shook her head poor skye such a darling man i tilted my head she was the first of skyes relations to actually say something nice about him as a person which after all could just be a clumsy attempt to deflect suspicion from her you knew skye well no to be honest no he and rodger werent that close funny thing that skye used to come by the house frequently when we first got married he was rodgers best man did he tell you that but when glen was born well he stopped coming around as much i dunno maybe he didnt like kids he never had any of his own anyway he really hasnt been a big part of our lives for oh eighteen years now but rodgers fingerprints were accepted by skyes lock oh yes rodger owns the unit skye has his current offices in i hate to ask you this but im on the board of directors of tenthgen computing detective we were having a shareholders meeting this morning something like eight hundred people saw me there i asked more questions but didnt get any closer to identifying rodger hissocks motive and so i decided to cheat as i said sometimes i do wonder if im in the right kind of job thanks for your help ms connolly i dont want to take up any more of your time but can i use your bathroom before i go she smiled of course theres one down the hall and one upstairs the upstairs one sounded more promising for my purposes i went up to it and the door closed behind me i really did need to go but first i pulled out my forensic scanner and started looking for specimens razors and combs were excellent places to find dna samples so were towels if the user rubbed vigorously enough best of all though were toothbrushes i scanned everything but something was amiss according to the scanner there was dna present from one woman the xx chromosome pair made the gender clear and there was dna from one man but three males lived in this house father rodger elder son glen and younger son billy perhaps this bathroom was used only by the parents in which case id blown it id hardly get a chance to check out the other bathroom but no there were four sets of towels four toothbrushes and there on the edge of the tub a toy aquashuttle precisely the kind an eightyearold boy would play with curious four people obviously used this john but only two had left any genetic traces and that made no sense i mean sure i hardly ever washed when i was eight like billy but no one can use a washroom day in and day out without leaving some dna behind i relieved myself the toilet autoflushed and i went downstairs thanked ms connolly again and left like i said i was cheating making me wonder again whether i really was cut out for a career in law enforcement even though it was a violation of civil rights i took the male dna sample id found in the hissockconnolly bathroom to dana rundstedt who read its sooth for me i was amazed by the results if i hadnt cheated i might never have figured it out it was a damnnear perfect crime but it all fit after seeing what was in the male dna the fact that of the surviving hissocks only rodger apparently had free access to skyes inner office the fact that rodgers blaster was the murder weapon the fact that there were apparently only two people using the bathroom the fact that skye hated confrontation the fact that the hissockconnolly family had a lot of money they wanted to pass on to the next generation the fact that young glen looked just like his dad but was subdued and reserved the fact that glen had gone to a different soothsayer the fact that rodgers taste in receptionists was unusual the pieces all fit that part of my sooth at least must have been read correctly i was good at puzzling things out but i was still amazed by how elegant it was ray chen would sort out the legalities he was an expert at that kind of thing hed find a way to smooth over my unauthorized soothsaying before we brought this to trial i got in a cab and headed off to wheel three to confront the killer hold it right there i said coming down the long gently curving corridor at francis crick youre under arrest glen hissock stopped dead in his tracks what for i looked around then drew glen into an empty classroom for the murder of your uncle skye hissock or should i say for the murder of your brother the semantics are a bit tricky i dont know what youre talking about said glen in that subdued nervous voice of his i shook my head soothsayer skye had deserved punishment and his brother rodger was guilty of a heinous crime in fact a crime mendelian society considered every bit as bad as murder but i couldnt let glen get away with it im sorry for what happened to you i said the mental scars no doubt explained his sullen withdrawn manner he glared at me like that makes it better when did it start he was quiet for a time then gave a little shrug as if realizing there was no point in pretending any longer when i was twelve as soon as i entered puberty not every night you understand but often enough he paused then howd you figure it out i decided to tell him the truth there are only two different sets of dna in your house one female as youd expect and just one male glen said nothing i had the male dna read i was looking for a trait that might have provided a motive for your father you know what i found glen was still silent when your dads sooth was read just after birth maybe his parents were told that he was sterile certainly the proof is there in his dna an inability to produce viable sperm i paused remembering the details rundstedt had explained to me but the soothsayer back then couldnt have known the effect of having the variant form of gene abld with over a hundred tat repeats that variations function hadnt been identified that long ago but it was known by the time rodger turned eighteen by the time he went to see his big brother skye by the time skye gave him his adult soothsaying i paused but uncle skye hated confrontation didnt he glen was motionless a statue and so skye lied to your dad oh he told him about his sterility all right but he figured there was no point in getting into an argument about what that variant gene meant glen looked at the ground when at last he did speak his voice was bitter i had thought dad knew i confronted him christ sakes dad if you knew you had a gene for incestuous pedophilia why the hell didnt you seek counseling why the hell did you have kids but your father didnt know did he glen shook his head that bastard uncle skye hadnt told him in fairness i said skye probably figured that since your father couldnt have kids the problem would never come up but your dad made a lot of money and wanted it to pass to an heir and since he couldnt have an heir the normal way glens voice was full of disgust since he couldnt have an heir the normal way he had one made i looked the boy up and down id never met a clone before glen really was the spitting image of the old man a chip off the old block but like any dynasty the hissockconnolly clan wanted not just an heir but an heir and a spare little billy ten years younger than glen was likewise an exact genetic duplicate of rodger hissock produced from rodgers dna placed into one of rebeccas eggs all three hissock males had indeed left dna in that bathroom exactly identical dna have you always known you were a clone i asked glen shook his head i only just found out before i went for my adult soothsaying i wanted to see the report my parents had gotten when i was born but none existed my dad had decided to save some money he didnt need a new report done he figured my sooth would be identical to his after all when i went to get my sooth read and found that i was sterile well it all fell into place in my mind and so you took your fathers blaster and since your fingerprints are essentially the same as his glen nodded slowly his voice was low and bitter dad never knew in advance what was wrong with him never had a chance to get help uncle skye never told him even after dad had himself cloned skye never spoke up he looked at me fury in his cold gray eyes it doesnt work dammit our whole way of life doesnt work if a soothsayer doesnt tell the truth you cant play the hand youre dealt if you dont know what cards youve got skye deserved to die and you framed your dad for it you wanted to punish him too glen shook his head you dont understand man you cant understand try me i didnt want to punish dad i wanted to protect billy dad can afford the best damn lawyer in mendelia oh hell be found guilty sure but he wont get life his lawyer will cut it down to the minimum mandatory sentence for murder which is ten years i said realization dawning in ten years billy will be an adult and out of danger from rodger glen nodded once but rodger could have told the truth at any time revealed that you were a clone of him if hed done that he would have gotten off and suspicion would have fallen on you how did you know he wasnt going to speak up glen sounded a lot older than his eighteen years if dad exposed me id expose him and the penalty for child molestation is also a minimum ten years so hed be doing the time anyway he looked directly at me except being a murderer gets you left alone in jail and being a pedophile gets you wrecked up i nodded led him outside and hailed a robocab mendelia is a great place to live honest and hell i did solve the crime didnt i meaning i am a good detective so i guess my soothsayer didnt lie to me at least at least i hope not i had a sudden cold feeling that the sg would stop footing the bill long before this case could come to public trial the end
