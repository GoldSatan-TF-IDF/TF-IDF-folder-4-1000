monsters in the night clark ashton smith the change occurred before he could divest himself of more than his coat and scarf he had only to step out of the shoes to shed the socks with two backward kicks and shuffle off the trousers from his lean hindlegs and belly but he was still deepchested after the change and his shirt was harder to loosen his hackles rose with rage as he slewed his head around and tore it away with hasty fangs in a flurry of fallen buttons and rags tossing off the last irksome ribbons he regretted his haste always heretofore he had been careful in regard to small details the shirt was monogrammed he must remember to collect all the tatters later he could stuff them in his pockets and wear the coat buttoned closely on his way home when he had changed back hunger snarled within him mounting from belly to throat from throat to mouth it seemed that he had not eaten for a monthfor a month of months raw butchers meat was never fresh enough it had known the coldness of death and refrigeration and had lost all vital essence long ago there had been other meals warm and sauced with still spurting blood but now the thin memory merely served to exasperate his ravening chaos raced within his brain inconsequently for an instant he recalled the first warning of his malady preceding even the distaste for cooked meat the aversion the allergy to silver forks and spoons it had soon extended to other objects of the same metal he had cringed even from the touch of coinage had been forced to use paper and to refuse change steel too was a substance unfriendly to beings like him and the time came when he could abide it little more than silver what made him think of such matters now setting his teeth on edge with repugnance choking him with something worse than nausea the hunger returned demanding swift appeasement with clumsy pads he pushed his discarded raiment under the shrubbery hiding it from the heavyjowled moon it was the moon that drew the tides of madness in his blood and compelled the metamorphosis but it must not betray to any chance passerby the garments he would need later when he returned to human semblance after the nights hunting the night was warm and windless and the woodland seemed to hold its breath there were he knew other monsters abroad in that year of the twentyfirst century the vampire still survived subtler and deadlier protected by mans incredulity and he himself was not the only lycanthrope his brothers and sisters ranged unchallenged preferring the darker urban jungles while he being countrybred still kept the ancient ways moreover there were monsters unknown as yet to myth and superstition but these too were mostly haunters of cities he had no wish to meet any of them and of such meeting surely there was small likelihood he followed a crooked lane reconnoitered previously it was too narrow for cars and it soon became a mere path at the paths forking he ensconced himself in the shadow of a broad mistletoeblotted oak the path was used by certain late pedestrians who lived even farther out from town one of them might come along at any moment whimpering a little with the hunger of a starved hound he waited he was a monster that nature had made ready to obey natures first commandment thou shalt kill and eat he was a thing of terror a fable whispered around prehistoric cavernfires a miscegenation allied by later myth to the powers of hell and sorcery but in no sense was he akin to those monsters beyond nature the spawn of a new and blacker magic who killed without hunger and without malevolence he had only minutes to wait before his tensing ears caught the faroff vibration of footsteps the steps came rapidly nearer seeming to tell him much as they came they were firm and resilient tireless and rhythmic telling of youth or of full maturity untouched by age they told surely of a worthwhile prey or prime lean meat and vital abundant blood there was a slight froth on the lips of the one who waited he had ceased to whimper he crouched closer to the ground for the anticipated leap the path ahead was heavily shadowed dimly moving fast the walker appeared in the shadows he seemed to be all that the watcher had surmised from the sound of his footsteps he was tall and wellshouldered swinging with a lithe sureness a precision of powerful tendon and muscle his head was a faceless blur in the gloom he was hatless clad in dark coat and trousers such as anyone might wear his steps rang with the assurance of one who has nothing to fear and has never dreamt of the crouching creatures of darkness now he was almost abreast of the watchers covert the watcher could wait no longer but sprang from his ambush of shadow towering high upon the stranger as his hindpaws left the ground his rush was irresistible as always the stranger toppled backward sprawling and helpless as others had done and the assailant bent to the bare throat that gleamed more enticingly than that of a siren it was a strategy that had never failed til now the shock the consternation had hurled him away from that prostrate figure and had forced him back upon teetering haunches it was the shock perhaps that had caused him to change again swiftly resuming human shape before his hour as the change began he spat out several broken lupine fangs and then he was spitting human teeth the stranger rose to his feet seemingly unshaken and undismayed he came forward in a rift of revealing moonlight stooping to a halfcrouch and flexing his berylliumsteel fingers enameled with fleshpink whowhatare you quavered the werewolf the stranger did not bother to answer as he advanced every synapse of the computing brain transmitting the conditioned message translated into simplest binary terms dangerous not human kill
