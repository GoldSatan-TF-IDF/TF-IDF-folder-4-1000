reading histories gentlemen and courteous readers whosoever i have here published in print for your sakes the two tragical discourses of the scythian shepherd tamburlaine that became so great a conqueror and so mighty a monarch my hope is that they will be now no less acceptable unto you to read after your serious affairs and studies than they have been lately delightful for many of you to see when the same were shewed in london upon stages i have purposely omitted and left out some fond and frivolous gestures digressing and in my poor opinion far unmeet for the matter which i thought might seem more tedious unto the wise than any way else to be regarded though haply they have been of some vainconceited fondlings greatly gaped at what time they were shewed upon the stage in their graced deformities nevertheless now to be mixtured in print with such matter of worth it would prove a great disgrace to so honourable and stately a history great folly were it in me to commend unto your wisdoms either the eloquence of the author that writ them or the worthiness of the matter itself i therefore leave unto your learned censures both the one and the other and myself the poor printer of them unto your most courteous and favourable protection which if you vouchsafe to accept you shall evermore bind me to employ what travail and service i can to the advancing and pleasuring

in scythia besides rich presents from the puissant cham we have his highness letters to command aid and assistance if we stand in need tamburlaine but now you see these letters and commands are countermanded by a greater man and through my provinces you must expect letters of conduct from my mightiness if you intend to keep your treasure safe but since i love to live at liberty as easily may you get the soldans crown as any prizes out of my precinct for they are friends that help to wean my state till men and kingdoms help to strengthen it and must maintain my life exempt from servitude

invincible as many circumcised turks we have and warlike bands of christians renied as hath the ocean or the terrene sea small drops of water when the moon begins to join in one her semicircled horns yet would we not be bravd with foreign power nor raise our siege before the grecians yield or breathless lie before the citywalls king of fez renowmed emperor and mighty general what if you sent the

tamburlaine which of your whole displeasures should be most hath seemd to be digested long ago zenocrate although it be digested long ago as his exceeding favours have deservd and might content the queen of heaven as well as it hath changd my firstconceivd disdain yet since a farther passion feeds my thoughts with ceaseless and disconsolate conceits which dye my looks so lifeless as they are and might if my extremes had full events make me the ghastly counterfeit of death agydas eternal heaven sooner be dissolvd and all that pierceth phoebus silver eye before such hap fall to zenocrate

with techelles and others agydas with tamburlaine ah fair zenocrate let not a man so vile and barbarous that holds you from your father in despite and keeps you from the honours of a queen being supposd his worthless concubine be honourd with your love but for necessity so now the mighty soldan hears of you your highness needs not doubt but in short time he will with tamburlaines destruction redeem you from this deadly servitude zenocrate leave to wound me with these words and speak of tamburlaine as he deserves the entertainment we have had of him is far from villany or servitude and might in noble minds be counted princely agydas how can you fancy one that looks so fierce only disposd to martial stratagems who when he shall embrace you in his arms will tell how many thousand men he slew and when you look for amorous discourse will rattle forth his facts of war and blood too harsh a subject for your dainty ears zenocrate as looks the sun through nilus flowing stream or when the morning holds him in her arms so looks my lordly love fair tamburlaine his talk much sweeter than the muses song they sung for honour gainst pierides or when minerva did with neptune strive and higher would i rear my estimate than juno sister to the highest god if i were matchd with mighty tamburlaine agydas yet be not so inconstant in your love but let the young arabian live in hope after your rescue to enjoy his choice you see though first the king of persia being a shepherd seemd to love you much now in his majesty he leaves those looks those words of favour and those comfortings and gives no more than common courtesies zenocrate thence rise the tears that so distain my cheeks fearing his love through my unworthiness tamburlaine goes to her and takes her away lovingly by the hand looking wrathfully on agydas and says nothing exeunt all except agydas agydas betrayd by fortune and suspicious love threatend with frowning wrath and jealousy surprisd with fear of hideous revenge i stand aghast but most astonied to see his choler shut in secret thoughts and wrapt in silence of his angry soul upon his brows was pourtrayd ugly death and in his eyes the fury of his heart that shone as comets menacing revenge and cast a pale complexion on his cheeks as when the seaman sees the hyades gather an army of cimmerian clouds auster and aquilon with winged steeds all sweating tilt about the watery heavens with shivering spears enforcing thunderclaps and from their shields strike flames of lightning allfearful folds his sails and sounds the main lifting his prayers to the heavens for aid against the terror of the winds and waves so fares agydas for the latefelt frowns that send a tempest to my daunted thoughts and make my soul divine her overthrow reenter techelles with a naked dagger and usumcasane techelles see you agydas how the king salutes you he bids you prophesy what it imports agydas i prophesied before and now i prove the killing frowns of jealousy and love he needed not with words confirm my fear for words are vain where working tools present the naked action of my threatend end it says agydas thou shalt surely die and of extremities elect the least more honour and less pain it may procure to die by this resolved hand of thine than stay the torments he and heaven have sworn then haste agydas and prevent the plagues which thy prolonged fates may draw on thee go wander free from fear of tyrants rage removed from the torments and the hell wherewith he may excruciate thy soul and let agydas by agydas die and with this stab slumber eternally stabs himself techelles usumcasane see how right the man hath hit the meaning of my lord the king usumcasane faith and techelles it was manly done and since he was so wise and honourable let us afford him

four virgins with branches of laurel in their hands governor still doth this man or rather god of war batter our walls and beat our turrets down and to resist with longer stubbornness or hope of rescue from the soldans power were but to bring our wilful overthrow and make us desperate of our threatend lives we see his tents have now been altered with terrors to the last and cruelst hue his coalblack colours every where advancd threaten our city with a general spoil and if we should with common rites of arms offer our safeties to his clemency i fear the custom proper to his sword which he observes as parcel of his fame intending so to terrify the world by any innovation or remorse will never be dispensd with till our deaths therefore for these our harmless virgins sakes whose honours and whose lives rely on him let us have hope that their unspotted prayers their blubberd cheeks and hearty humble moans will melt his fury into some remorse and use us like a loving conqueror first virgin if humble suite or imprecations utterd with tears of wretchedness and blood shed from the heads and hearts of all our sex some made your wives and some your children might have entreated your obdurate breasts to entertain some care of our securities whiles only danger beat upon our walls these more than dangerous warrants of our death had never been erected as they be nor you depend on such weak helps as we governor well lovely virgins think our countrys care our love of honour loath to be enthralld to foreign powers and rough imperious yokes would not with too much cowardice or fear before all hope of rescue were denied submit yourselves and us to servitude therefore in that your safeties and our own your honours liberties and lives were weighd in equal care and balance with our own endure as we the malice of our stars the wrath of tamburlaine and power of wars or be the means the overweighing heavens have kept to qualify these hot extremes and bring us pardon in your cheerful looks second virgin then here before the majesty of heaven and holy patrons of aegyptia with knees and hearts submissive we entreat grace to our words and pity to our looks that this device may prove propitious and through the eyes and ears of tamburlaine convey events of mercy to his heart grant that these signs of victory we yield may bind the temples of his conquering head to hide the folded furrows of his brows and shadow his displeased countenance with happy looks of ruth and lenity leave us my lord and loving countrymen what simple virgins may persuade we will governor farewell sweet virgins on whose safe return depends our city liberty and lives exeunt all except the virgins enter tamburlaine all in black and very melancholy techelles theridamas usumcasane with others tamburlaine what are the turtles frayd out of their nests alas poor fools must you be first shall feel the sworn destruction of damascus they knew my custom could they not as well have sent ye out when first my milkwhite flags through which sweet mercy threw her gentle beams reflexed them on their disdainful eyes as now when fury and incensed hate flings slaughtering terror from my coalblack tents and tells for truth submission comes too late first virgin most happy king and emperor of the earth image of honour and nobility for whom the powers divine have made the world and on whose throne the holy graces sit in whose sweet person is comprisd the sum of natures skill and heavenly majesty pity our plights o pity poor damascus pity old age within whose silver hairs honour and reverence evermore have reignd pity the marriagebed where many a lord in prime and glory of his loving joy embraceth now with tears of ruth and blood the jealous body of his fearful wife whose cheeks and hearts so punishd with conceit to think thy puissant neverstayed arm will part their bodies and prevent their souls from heavens of comfort yet their age might bear now wax all pale and witherd to the death as well for grief our ruthless governor hath thus refusd the mercy of thy hand whose sceptre angels kiss and furies dread as for their liberties their loves or lives o then for these and such as we ourselves for us for infants and for all our bloods that never nourishd thought against thy rule pity o pity sacred emperor the prostrate service of this wretched town and take in sign thereof this gilded wreath whereto each man of rule hath given his hand and wishd as worthy subjects happy means to be investers of thy royal brows even with the true egyptian diadem tamburlaine virgins in vain you labour to prevent that which mine honour swears shall be performd behold my sword what see you at the point first virgin nothing but fear and fatal steel my lord tamburlaine your fearful minds are thick and misty then for there sits death there sits imperious death keeping his circuit by the slicing edge but i am pleasd you shall not see him there he now is seated on my horsemens spears and on their points his fleshless body feeds techelles straight go charge a few of them to charge these dames and shew my servant death sitting in scarlet on their armed spears virgins o pity us tamburlaine away with them i say and shew them death the virgins are taken out by techelles and others i will not spare these proud egyptians nor change my martial observations for all the wealth of gihons golden waves or for the love of venus would she leave the angry god of arms and lie with me they have refusd the offer of their lives and know my customs are as peremptory as wrathful planets death or destiny reenter techelles what have your horsemen shown the virgins death techelles they have my lord and on damascus walls have hoisted up their slaughterd carcasses tamburlaine a sight as baneful to their souls i think as are thessalian drugs or mithridate but go my lords put the rest to the sword exeunt all except tamburlaine ah fair zenocrate divine zenocrate fair is too foul an epithet for thee that in thy passion for thy countrys love and fear to see thy kingly fathers harm with hair dishevelld wipst thy watery cheeks and like to flora in her mornings pride shaking her silver tresses in the air rainst on the earth resolved pearl in showers and sprinklest sapphires on thy shining face where beauty mother to the muses sits and comments volumes with her ivory pen taking instructions from thy flowing eyes eyes when that ebena steps to heaven in silence of thy solemn evenings walk making the mantle of the richest night the moon the planets and the meteors light there angels in their crystal armours fight a doubtful battle with my tempted thoughts for egypts freedom and the soldans life his life that so consumes zenocrate whose sorrows lay more siege unto my soul than all my army to damascus walls and neither persias sovereign nor the turk troubled my senses with conceit of foil so much by much as doth zenocrate what is beauty saith my sufferings then if all the pens that ever poets held had fed the feeling of their masters thoughts and every sweetness that inspird their hearts their minds and muses on admired themes if all the heavenly quintessence they still from their immortal flowers of poesy wherein as in a mirror we perceive the highest reaches of a human wit if these had made one poems period and all combind in beautys worthiness yet should there hover in their restless heads one thought one grace one wonder at the least which into words no virtue can digest but how unseemly is it for my sex my discipline of arms and chivalry my nature and the terror of my name to harbour thoughts effeminate and faint save only that in beautys just applause with whose instinct the soul of man is touchd and every warrior that is rapt with love of fame of valour and of victory must needs have beauty beat on his conceits i thus conceiving and subduing both that which hath stoopd the chiefest of the gods even from the fieryspangled veil of heaven to feel the lovely warmth of shepherds flames and mask in cottages of strowed reeds shall give the world to note for all my birth that virtue solely is the sum of glory and fashions men with true nobility whos within there enter attendants hath bajazeth been fed today attend ay my lord tamburlaine bring him forth and let us know if the town be ransacked exeunt attendants enter techelles theridamas usumcasane and others techelles the town is ours my lord and fresh supply of conquest and of spoil is offerd us tamburlaine thats well techelles whats the news

high as eagles soar zabina let all the swords and lances in the field stick in his breast as in their proper rooms at every pore let blood come dropping forth that lingering pains may massacre his heart and madness send his damned soul to hell bajazeth ah fair zabina we may curse his power the heavens may frown the earth for anger quake but such a star hath influence in his sword as rules the skies and countermands the gods more than cimmerian styx or destiny and then shall we in this detested guise with shame with hunger and with horror stay griping our bowels with retorqued thoughts and have no hope to end our ecstasies zabina then is there left no mahomet no god no fiend no fortune nor no hope of end to our infamous monstrous slaveries gape earth and let the fiends infernal view a

triumphs of our mightiness in this obscure infernal servitude bajazeth o life more loathsome to my vexed thoughts than noisome parbreak of the stygian snakes which fills the nooks of hell with standing air infecting all the ghosts with cureless griefs o dreary engines of my loathed sight that see my crown my honour and my name thrust under yoke and thraldom of a thief why feed ye still on days accursed beams and sink not quite into my torturd soul you see my wife my queen and emperess brought up and propped by the hand of fame queen of fifteen contributory queens now thrown to rooms of

cool and comfort me with longer date that in the shortend sequel of my life i may pour forth my soul into thine arms with words of love whose moaning intercourse hath hitherto been stayd with wrath and hate of our expressless bannd inflictions zabina sweet bajazeth i will prolong thy life as long as any blood or spark of breath can quench or cool the torments of my grief exit bajazeth now bajazeth abridge thy baneful days and beat the brains out of thy conquerd head since other means are all forbidden me that may be ministers of my decay o highest lamp of everliving jove accursed day

horsemens lances to be hoisted up and guiltlessly endure a cruel death for every fell and stout tartarian steed that stampd on others with their thundering hoofs when all their riders chargd their quivering spears began to check the ground and rein themselves gazing upon the beauty of their looks ah tamburlaine wert thou the cause of this that termst zenocrate thy dearest love whose lives were

it necessary to mark the varioe lectiones of the worthy printers composition histories ie dramas so called plays founded on history fond ie foolish concerning the omissions here alluded to some remarks will be found in the account of marlowe and his writings the account of marlowe and his writings is the introduction to this book of the works of christopher marlowe that is the book from which this play has been transcribed the following is from pages xvi and xvii of that introduction this tragedy which was entered in the stationers books th august a and printed during the same year has not come down to us in its original fulness and probably we have no cause to lament the curtailments which it suffered from the publisher of the first edition i have purposely he says omitted and left out some fond and frivolous gestures digressing and in my poor opinion far unmeet for the matter which i thought might seem more tedious unto the wise than any way else to be regarded though haply they have been of some vainconceited fondlings greatly gaped at what time they were shewed upon the stage in their graced deformities nevertheless now to be mixtured in print with such matter of worth it would prove a great disgrace to so honourable and stately a historyb by the words fond and frivolous gestures we are to understand those of the clown who very frequently figured with more or less prominence even in the most serious dramas of the time the introduction of such buffooneries into tragedyc is censured by hall towards the conclusion of a passage which as it mentions the turkish
