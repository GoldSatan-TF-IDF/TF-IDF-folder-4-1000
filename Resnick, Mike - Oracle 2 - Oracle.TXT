oracle by mike resnick copyright contents prologue part the whistlers book part the injuns book part the jade queens book part the icemans book part the oracles book prologue it was a time of giants there was no room for them to breathe and flex their muscles in mankinds sprawling democracy so they gravitated to the distant barren worlds of the inner frontier drawn ever closer to the bright galactic core like moths to a flame oh they fit into human frames most of them but they were giants nonetheless no one knew what had brought them forth in such quantity at this particular moment in human history perhaps there was a need for them in a galaxy filled to overflowing with little people possessed of even smaller dreams possibly it was the savage splendor of inner frontier itself for it was certainly not a place for ordinary men and women or maybe it was simply time for a race that had been notably short of giants in recent eons to begin producing them once again but whatever the reason they swarmed out beyond the farthest reaches of the explored galaxy spreading the seed of man to hundreds of new worlds and in the process creating a cycle of legends that would never die as long as men could tell tales of heroic deeds there was faraway jones who set foot on more than five hundred new worlds never quite certain what he was looking for always sure that he hadnt yet found it there was a shadowy figure known only as the whistler who had killed more than one hundred men and aliens there was friday nellie who turned her whorehouse into a hospital during the war against the setts and finally saw it declared a shrine by the very men who once tried to close it down there was jamal who left no fingerprints or footprints but had plundered palaces that to this day do not know they were plundered there was betaworld murphy who at various times owned nine different goldmining worlds and lost every one of them at the gaming tables there was backbreaker ben ami who wrestled aliens for money and killed men for pleasure there was the marquis of queensbury who fought by no rules at all and the white knight albino killer of fifty men and sally the blade and the forever kid who reached the age of nineteen and just stopped growing for the next two centuries and catastrophe baker who made whole planets shake beneath his feet and the exotic pearl of maracaibo and the scarlet queen whose sins were condemned by every race in the galaxy and father christmas and the onearmed bandit with his deadly prosthetic arm and the earth mother and lizard malloy and the deceptively mildmannered cemetery smith giants all yet there was one giant who was destined to tower over all of the others to juggle the lives of men and worlds as if they were so many toys to rewrite the history of the inner frontier and the outer frontier and the spiral arm and even the allpowerful democracy itself at various times in her short turbulent life she was known as the soothsayer and the oracle and the prophet by the time she had passed from the galactic scene only a handful of survivors knew her true name or her planet of origin or even her early history for such is the way with giants and legends but she had an origin and a history and a name this is her story part the whistlers book his real name was carlos mendoza but it had been so many years since he used it that it seemed almost alien to him here on the inner frontier among the sparsely populated worlds between mans sprawling democracy and the galactic core men changed names with the ease and occasionally the frequency that their brothers in the democracy changed clothes mendoza had had many occupations in his sixtyfive years some of which he wished to forget and some that he wished his enemies would forget and he had had almost as many names but the one that had stuck was the iceman there were people who said he was the iceman because he had once been the ruler of a planet totally covered by a milethick glacier others said no that he got the name because he was a coldblooded killer a few suggested that he possessed a rare disease that threatened to kill him by lowering his body temperature and thats why he had finally settled on the hot desert world of last chance the iceman didnt care what people thought about the genesis of his name in fact there wasnt much that he did care about money of course and the power he exercised as the owner of the end of the line the only tavern on last chance but over the years he had lost interest in most other things except gossip miners traders explorers adventurers and bounty hunters would stop on last chance to refuel their ships or lay in their supplies or register their claims or occasionally to wait for their mail or their rewards to catch up with them and they would come to the end of the line and they would talk the iceman never asked any questions never volunteered any information but he listened intently and once in a long while he would hear some tidbit that momentarily brought a touch of animation to his impassive face when that happened he would disappear for a week or a month after which he would return to last chance as suddenly as he had left then he would sit in the bar and listen to more gossip more tales of adventure and derringdo of fortunes made and fortunes lost of battles won and empires fallen his face expressionless those who cared about him and they were few and far between occasionally asked him precisely what he was hoping to hear what it was that he went off to find on his rare excursions he would politely sidestep their questions for despite his reputation he was a courteous man and shortly thereafter they would see him sitting at another table listening to another travelers tale he was not a physically impressive man he was an inch or two below normal height and he carried about thirty pounds of excess weight and his hair was thinning on the top and white on the sides he walked with a decided limp most people assumed that he had a prosthetic leg but no one ever asked him and he never volunteered any information about it his voice was neither deep nor rich though when he spoke on last chance it carried a ring of absolute authority that very few men challenged he was known throughout the inner frontier but nobody knew quite what he had done to acquire his notoriety he had killed some men of course but that was hardly sufficient to establish a reputation on the lawless frontier worlds it was rumored that he had once worked for the democracy in some covert capacity but by its very nature nothing was known about his job once fourteen years ago he had disappeared from last chance for a number of months and word had it that he had been responsible for the deaths of quite a few bounty hunters but no one could verify it and the details were so vague that very few people put much credence in the story there was one woman who had heard the story and believed it and after many false starts she finally tracked him down in his refuge on last chance half a galaxy away from the affluent populous worlds of the democracy she was middleaged with blue eyes and nondescript sandcolored hair her nose had a small lump at the bridge as if it had been broken many years ago and her teeth were too white and too even to be her own the end of the line was filled with the usual crowd of adventurers and misfits humans and aliens when she entered it the aliens seven canphorites a pair of lodinites two domarians and one each from a trio of races she had never seen before were clustered together at a number of small tables most of them couldnt metabolize the bars offerings and were obviously waiting for the large casino which consisted of some two dozen tables and an equal number of exotic games of chance to open its doors a small sign written in various human and alien languages announced that that happy moment would occur at sunset the heads of a quartet of alien carnivores each snarling in mute defiance were positioned above the long hardwood bar and in a glass case just next to the changemaker was a tattered copy of a poem written by black orpheus the bard of the inner frontier which he had created and autographed when he had stopped on last chance for an evening some two centuries ago twenty humans some dressed in colorful and expensive garments others wearing the dull browns and grays of miners and prospectors stood at the bar or sat at tables none of them paid her any attention as she entered the tavern looked around for a moment and finally approached the bartender im looking for a man known as the iceman she said is he here the bartender nodded his head right over there sitting by the window will he speak to me she asked the bartender chuckled that depends on his mood but hell listen to you she thanked him and walked over to the iceman s table giving the aliens a wide berth as she did so may i join you she asked pull up a chair mrs bailey he said she looked surprised you know who i am no he answered but i know your name how you had to identify yourself when you requested landing coordinates said the iceman nobody lands on last chance without my approval i see she said sitting down she stared across the table i cant believe that ive finally found you i wasnt lost mrs bailey he said expressionlessly perhaps not but ive been looking for you for more than four years and whats so important that you would spend four years of your life trying to find me my name is bettina bailey she began i know does it mean anything to you should it if the name bailey doesnt then ive wasted an enormous amount of time ive never heard of anyone called bettina bailey he replied noncommittally ive heard stories rumors really to be honest that you may have known my daughter go on said the iceman her name is penelope the iceman pulled out a small cigar what did you hear i heard that you knew her bettina bailey paused studying the icemans face ive even heard that she spent some time on last chance that was fourteen years ago mrs bailey said the iceman lighting his cigar i havent seen her since he shrugged for all i know shes dead now bettina bailey stared unblinking at him if were talking about the same girl you know thats impossible the iceman returned her stare for a long moment as if considering his answer finally he took another puff of his cigar and nodded were talking about the same girl she would be twentytwo years old now that would be about right agreed the iceman bettina bailey paused again ive heard other rumors too she said at last such as that shes living with aliens an alien the iceman corrected her then you know where she is he shook his head no i just know who she was with the last time i saw her ive also heard that youve spent a lot of time looking for her continued bettina bailey he stared impassively at her and made no answer and that you know more about her than any other man alive she continued its possible he agreed its more than possible its a fact all right its a fact now what i want my daughter back pardon my pointing it out mrs bailey but it took you long enough to come to that decision i have been looking for her for sixteen years she paused she was taken from me in the democracy the democracy encompasses more than ten thousand worlds it took me more than a decade and most of my late husbands money to discover that she was no longer there but was on the inner frontier she was on the inner frontier fourteen years ago mrs bailey said the iceman she could be anywhere now the inner frontier the rim the spiral arm the outer frontier even back in the democracy it wouldnt be difficult for someone with her abilities to hide from anyone who was looking for her shes on the inner frontier repeated bettina bailey adamantly he stared at her unable to totally conceal his interest how do you know when you are willing to be open and frank with me i will respond in kind she replied for the moment you will have to take my word that i know where she is he paused for a long moment all right he said at last you know where she is she nodded and i want her back and you want her back he repeated why have you come to me why dont you just go to wherever she is and take her home its not that simple she said she may not recognize me and even if she does shes been with aliens for most of her life she may not want to come back with me shes an adult by now said the iceman thats her choice to make im willing to let her make it said bettina bailey but away from the influence of the aliens theres only one alien that i know about she shook her head shes on an alien planet which one ill tell you when we have an agreement what kind of agreement asked the iceman i want you to bring her back to me if you dont think shell go with you why do you think shell come with me i told you ive studied you youve had experience dealing with aliens and operating on the inner frontier if you need help youll know what kind to get and where to get it the iceman stared at her thoughtfully it could be very expensive mrs bailey how expensive a million maria theresa dollars now another million when the job is done maria theresa dollars she repeated frowning i thought they were only in use in the corvus system whats wrong with credits we dont have much faith in the longevity of the democracy out here mrs bailey answered the iceman we have even less faith in its currency credits are unacceptable if you cant get the maria theresa dollars ill take double the amount in new stalin rubles ill get the dollars she replied how soon i can have them transferred here in three days time then ill set the wheels in motion three days from now said the iceman what do you mean set the wheels in motion ill select who i want to find your daughter but i thought you would be going he shook his head she knows me mrs bailey and i dont think shed be too happy to see me again but i chose you precisely because she does know you thats not necessarily an advantage with your daughter he said dryly now where is she bettina bailey was silent for a moment then she shrugged shes on alpha crepello iii never heard of it its in the quinellus cluster and what makes you so sure shes there she leaned forward intently we both know that my daughter has a rare talent go on word has gotten back to deluros viii that there is a human female on alpha crepello iii the public isnt supposed to know about her but ive bribed sources within the govemment no one seems to know if this female is in the employ of the aliens who inhabit alpha crepello iii or if she is their prisoner but she is known as the oracle she paused if i were to choose a name for penelope i couldnt choose a more accurate one than that and that s the sum total of your knowledge asked the iceman no description no communication with her or anyone whos dealt with her just that answered bettina bailey the alpha crepello system isnt part of the democracy and has almost no commerce with it it took me two years to ascertain that the oracle was a human and another two to determine that she was a female the iceman stared at her do you know the odds against this being your daughter mrs bailey ive spent sixteen years piecing together these bits of information she replied i could die of old age before i came up with concrete proof she paused do we have a deal for just an instant the interest he had tried so hard to conceal flashed across his face then just as quickly the impassive mask was back in place we have a deal said the iceman the star charts called it boyson iii locally it was known as the frenchmans world in the beginning it had been a wild untamed jungle planet covered with dense vegetation and a plethora of exotic animals then man had moved in had killed rnost of the animals and plowed under the jungle and had turned it into an agricultural world supplying food for all the nearby mining planets but within twenty years alien viruses destroyed the imported meat animals the imported corn and wheat and even the hybrid animals and crops after that the colonists all went elsewhere and boyson iii slowly reverted back into a jungle world over the next six centuries then the frenchman had arrived they said that hed spent his whole life collecting alien animals for zoos back in the democracy and that he had retired to boyson iii to spend his remaining years hunting for sport he had erected a sprawling white house on the banks of a wide river had invited some friends to join him and eventually word of the hunting leaked out and a small safari industry developed all that had been more than two hundred years ago the frenchmans world hadnt changed much in the interim except that its wildlife had been pretty thoroughly decimated and only a handful of guides remained the rest having migrated to newly opened worlds where their clients could fill their trophy rooms with less effort it was estimated that the permanent human population of the frenchmans world was now less than two hundred one of them who was said to be the last man to have been born on the planet had moved into the frenchmans old house and created his own private landing strip by the river his name was joshua jeremiah chandler he had been a very successful hunter in his youth but no one had seen him on the safari trail in almost a decade he was known initially on the frenchman s world and finally all across the inner frontier as the whistler from a trick he had of whistling to get an animals attention just before he shot it he was a very private even secretive man who kept his business and his thoughts to himself he was gone from the planet for long periods of time and he did almost all his banking on other worlds no mail or radio messages ever came for him though from time to time a small ship landed at his strip by the river the icemans ship was the most recent to touch down and as he walked up the long winding path to the house he found himself sweating profusely in the heat and the hurnidity and wondering why anyone would choose to live in such surroundings he slapped a purpleandgold flying insect that had landed on the side of his neck barely avoided stepping on a nastylooking horned reptile that hissed at him and scuttled off into the thick undergrowth and mopped his face with a handkerchief when he emerged from the bush he climbed a stone staircase and found himself standing on a large deck that extended far out over the river the water was teeming with life huge aquatic marsupials delicate water snakes long ugly reptiles all swam among a plethora of colorful fish that dwelt near the surface the forest that lined the water had been cleared from the far bank so that observers on the deck could watch herbivores coming down to the river to drink right now there were clouds of butterflies flying low over the water and a score of avians walked methodically across the clearing pecking at the ground while a handful of water birds waded in the shallows searching for small fish the iceman heard a glass door slide into a wall and a moment later a tall lean auburnhaired man in his late thirties walked out onto the deck he was dressed in a nondescript brown outfit that seemed to have pockets everywhere a largebrimmed hat shaded his eyes from the glare of the sun i see you made it said chandler by way of greeting youre a hard man to find whistler replied the iceman you managed chandler paused care for a drink the iceman nodded please i really ought to charge you said chandler with an amused smile as he led the iceman into the interior of the house i dont recall you ever giving me a free drink back on last chance and you never will said the iceman returning chandlers smile the room in which he found himself was quite large and the cool stone floor whitewashed walls and widespread eaves helped to dissipate the heat there were a few stuffed chairs covered with the pelts of native animals a rug made of the head and fur of a large carnivore a small book and tape case a subspace radio set and a clock made of some strange translucent substance that seemed to be forever shimmering and changing colors the walls were lined with framed wanted posters each depicting an outlaw that chandler had killed or captured interesting trophies commented the iceman gesturing to the posters people make the best hunting answered chandler he walked behind a hardwood bar and opened a small refrigerator whatll it be anything cold chandler mixed two identical drinks and handed one to the iceman this should do it the iceman took a long swallow thanks anything for a client said chandler he looked intently at the iceman you are a client arent you potentially the iceman looked out across the river do you mind if we go back out on the deck it may be a pain in the ass to get here but its really lovely once you arrive why not assented chandler leading him back out to the deck it must be very convenient to be able to stand right here and shoot dinner continued the iceman chandler shrugged i wouldnt know oh i never hunt within five miles of here i dont want to frighten the game away he paused some animals are for eating some are for sport and some are for looking at these are for looking at you know said the iceman now that i think of it i havent seen any weapons around here oh there are weapons chandler assured him but not for the game a delicate white avian landed atop one of the aquatic marsupials and began picking insects off its head i miss this place whenever im away from it said chandler standing at the edge of the deck and looking across the river if i take this assignment how long will i be gone i wont lie to you said the iceman this job doesnt figure to be easy or fast what does it entail asked chandler sipping his drink and staring out at the river im not sure yet chandler arched an eyebrow but made no comment have you ever heard of penelope bailey continued the iceman after a pause i think everyone must have heard of her back about ten or fifteen years ago answered chandler they were offering one hell of a reward for her thats the one as i recall everybody wanted her the democracy a couple of alien worlds even some pirates i never did hear what happened to her just that one day a bunch of bounty hunters turned up dead and after that nobody seemed all that interested in trying to collect the reward he turned to the iceman there was a story making the rounds that you were involved in some way i was what was all the fuss about asked chandler hundreds of people were after her but no one ever said what made a little girl worth five or six million credits she wasnt exactly your normal runofthemill little girl said the iceman wryly chandler picked a few pieces of stale bread out of one of his pockets and laid them out on the railing then watched as a trio of colorful avians descended picked them up and flew off with them if you want me to find her and bring her back youre going to have to tell me what made her worth all that money he said at last i will said the iceman taking a sip of his drink and you wont have to find her you know where she is perhaps either you do or you dont i know the location of the person im sending you after replied the iceman i dont know if shes penelope bailey would you know penelope bailey if you saw her asked chandler its been a long time and shes a grown woman now answered the iceman i honestly dont know if id recognize her then how will you know if i bring you the right woman there are other ways of telling the iceman paused also if she is penelope bailey theres every likelihood that you wont be able to bring her back chandler looked up at the sky which had suddenly clouded over it rains every afternoon about this time he said lets go inside and make ourselves comfortable and you can lay it out for me he led the iceman back inside the house ordered the glass portals to slide shut and walked over to a pair of chairs that had been carved out of the native hardwood of the surrounding forest and covered with the pelts of some blueskinned animals all right he said when both men had seated themselves im listening penelope bailey was eight years old when i met her said the iceman the democracy had taken her away from her parents when she was five or six and an alien had stolen her from the democracy by the time i ran across her she was in the company of a woman who used to work for me why did the democracy seize her in the first place asked chandler she has a gift a talent if you will that they wanted what was it shes prescient you mean she can predict the future the iceman shook his head its not that simple she can see an almost infinite number of possible futures and she can manipulate events so that the one most favorable to her comes to pass chandler stared at him for a long moment i dont believe it he said at last its the truth ive seen it in action then why isnt she queen of the whole damned universe when i first met her she could only see those futures in which she faced imminent danger by the time we parted she could see the outcome of everything from poker hands to gunfights and could manipulate things so theyd come out the way she wanted them to but she could only see a few hours into the future he paused if her power never extended beyond that she could make herself a very rich very powerful woman but in the larger scheme of things shed be no more than a nuisance but you think her talent has continued to mature said chandler it was not a question i dont know why it shouldnt have replied the iceman it grew more powerful almost daily when i knew her im surprised you didnt try to kill her i did he patted his prosthetic leg this is what i got for my trouble chandler nodded but said nothing the last time i saw her she was with an alien called the mock turtle ill swear thats what it looked like and to the best of my knowledge no human has seen her since why an alien it practically worshipped her and it seemed convinced that once she developed her powers she could keep the democracy from assimilating its world is the girl on its world asked chandler the iceman shook his head no ive been there twice and theres no sign of them so thats where you go when youre not on last chance said chandler not at all surprised youre hunting for penelope bailey it hasnt done any good the iceman grimaced and finished his drink if theres someone better equipped to stay hidden than a woman who can see all possible futures i cant imagine who it is then how did you find her asked chandler i didnt answered the iceman but a week ago i was approached by a woman who represented herself as penelopes mother she thinks she knows where the girl is and she hired me to bring her back represented herself repeated chandler thats a curious choice of words she lied from start to finish what makes you think so she knew things she had no business knowing such as she knew that penelope escaped with an alien but only about ten people on a little planet called killhaven know that she knew that ive been searching for her but ive never told that to anyone he paused she knew that she was looking for the iceman and not for carlos mendoza she works for the democracy of course the iceman nodded in agreement nobody else has the resources to spy on me for fourteen years theyve been after her for fourteen years began chandler sixteen interjected the iceman all right sixteen why have they approached you now because they think theyve found her thats not good enough said chandler why did they lie to you or better still if theyve found her why dont they just go in after her themselves im sure theyve sent their best people in after her and failed or else they would never have approached me the iceman suddenly noticed his drink and finished it with a single swallow as for why they sent someone who pretended to be penelopes mother its simple enough the inner frontier doesnt owe any allegiance to the democracy and they dont know if id be willing to help them also he added i killed some of their bounty hunters fourteen years ago why did you want to save her from a bunch of bounty hunters she was never in any danger from them answered the iceman i was trying to save another member of her party he paused it didnt help you make penelope bailey sound very formidable commented chandler she is the iceman assured him seriously make no mistake about it where do they think she is a planet called alpha crepello iii out in the quinellus cluster and theyre sure its her the iceman shook his head they think it is they dont know for sure what makes them think so theres supposed to be a young human woman there living among the aliens whos known as the oracle and thats it probably not said the iceman almost certainly not but thats all ive been told that s not much to go on said chandler what do you think theyve kept back probably something about how many men theyve sent in and never heard from again thats the kind of thing that would convince them theyre right and its also guaranteed to discourage a potential recruit chandler was silent for a long moment then he looked across at the iceman ive got a question for you what is it this little girl cost you a leg and i gather she killed a friend of yours indirectly then why arent you going after her yourself im a sixtyfiveyearold man with a potbelly and an artificial leg answered the iceman if it really is penelope bailey id be dead before i could get close to her maybe i could have done it twenty years ago but not now he looked directly at chandler thats why ive come to you whistler of all the men in this business youre just about the best youve infiltrated half a dozen worlds and youre a better killer than i ever was can she be killed the iceman shrugged i dont know what kind of money are we talking about here half a million up front another half million when the job is completed credits asked chandler with a frown maria theresa dollars chandler nodded time limit if you havent gotten to her in six months time youre never going to reach her what if i come back emptyhanded if you accept the assignment the front moneys yours no matter what happens said the iceman will your client agree to that considering that shes not really bettina bailey i dont see that she has any choice what about expenses asked chandler the iceman chuckled not with a half million up front i may need to hire some help along the way id advise against it said the iceman why the less attention you attract to yourself the more likely you are to come out of this alive i may want to hire some men to draw attention away from me thats your privilege the iceman stared at him thoughtfully if youre successful and you can prove to me that you needed them youll be reimbursed chandler eyed him thoughtfully what do you get out of this money satisfaction revenge take your choice chandler smiled all of the above he paused do they speak any terran on this planet i dont know but according to my star charts its got three terraformed moons that are inhabited by humans theyre your logical starting point why not just approach her directly if direct approaches worked the democracy wouldnt have sought me out answered the iceman will you take the job chandler considered the proposition for a moment then nodded yeah ill take it good said the iceman if it turns out that the oracle isnt penelope bailey bring her out and if she is penelope bailey once you know its her find a way to get word back to me theres no way youre going to bring her out if she doesnt want to come so kill her if you can if i dont hear from you in six months ill know youre dead you mean youll assume im dead i meant what i said replied the iceman seriously the radio beeped to life you are now within the alpha crepello system said a mechanical voice please identify yourself this is the gamestalker registration number hj eight galactic standard days out of the frenchmans world joshua jeremiah chandler commanding we have no record of the frenchman s world gamestalker its the third planet in the boyson system on the inner frontier responded chandler there was a brief silence what is your purpose for visiting the alpha crepello system gamestalker business state the nature of your business please im a salesman what do you sell rare stamps and coins have you a confirmed appointment with any inhabitant of the alpha crepello system yes with whom is your appointment carlos mendoza replied chandler using the first name that came to mind i believe he resides on alpha crepello iii another silence we have no record of any carlos mendoza living on alpha crepello iii is carlos mendoza a human yes he does not reside on alpha crepello iii said the voice with finality then perhaps he is merely a visitor said chandler all i know is that i was supposed to meet him there the alpha crepello system is not a member of the democracy said the voice we have no reciprocal trade agreements with the democracy we have no military treaties with the democracy and we do not recognize democracy passports no one may land on alpha crepello iii without special permission of the government and this permission is rarely given to members of your race there was a brief pause you may land on any of alpha crepello iiis terraformed moons but if you attempt to land on alpha crepello iii itself you will be detained and your ship will be subject to confiscation thank you said chandler gamestalker over and out the iceman had told him that he wouldnt be allowed to land on the planet itself so he was neither surprised nor disappointed that permission had been denied him he sighed stretched and stared at his viewscreen computer he said bring up holograms charts and readouts on alpha crepello iiis terraformed moons working done replied his ships computer there were three of them port maracaibo port samarkand and port marrakech each had once been rich in fissionable materials and had been terraformed by the longdefunct republic almosttwo millennia ago the inhabitants of alpha crepello iii had objected and the navy had subdued them in a brief but furious battle then when the democracy had succeeded the republic alpha crepello iii which had been dubbed hades by its human ambassador because of its reddish soil and incredibly hot climate had declined to remain an active member of the galactic community and had cut all ties with its neighboring worlds as well as with deluros viii the huge distant world that had become the capital of the race of man since the moons were virtually mined out by that time and man had more immediate conquests and problems to deal with hades had been allowed to go its own way the three moons were of little or no use to the residents of hades and as the miners left other men moved in men who were seeking worlds that had no official ties with the democracy hades had originally objected but the prospect of another war convinced them to practice a form of benign neglect toward the moons and their new inhabitants and over the centuries the moons gradually became a clearinghouse for black market goods a sanctuary for human outlaws a gathering place for mercenaries and a conduit between the free worlds of the quinellus cluster and the regulated worlds of mankinds vast democracy computer said chandler how many humans reside on each of the terraformed moons on port maracaibo on port samarkand and on port marrakech replied the computer these figures are accurate as of the last census taken seven years ago what form of currency is in use on each of the moons they accept all forms of human currency that are traded within the democracy and on the inner frontier plus the currencies of hades canphor vi canphor vii and lodin xi the value of each is pegged to the daily exchange rate of the democracy credit as determined on deluros viii please give me their climactic and gravitational readouts all three moons were terraformed by the same republic pioneer team and are identical in climate and gravity responded the eomputer gravity is percent earth and deluros standard temperature is a constant twentytwo degrees celsius by day and seventeen degrees celsius by night atmosphere is earth and deluros viii normal do they all have spaceports they possess spaceports for class h and smaller ships larger ships are required to dock in orbiting hangars there doesnt seem much to choose among them remarked chandler it was neither a question nor a command so the computer did not respond which one is closest to hades port marrakech all right said chandler port marrakech it is his landing was uneventful and shortly thereafter he made his way through the crowded spaceport he spotted a few faces here and there that he remembered seeing on wanted posters but he paid them no attention concentrating only on making his way to the main exit once outside he hailed a groundcar that took him into the heart of the nearby city as far as he could tell the only city on port marrakech the buildings boasted numerous exotic arches and angles and most of them had been whitewashed he was unaware of the genesis of the name marrakech but he assumed that it was a city somewhere in the galaxy that greatly resembled the one in which he now found himself the architecture was too much of a piece and too different from the other worlds he had seen not to have been carefully planned where to now asked the driver as they entered the heavy traffic of the city center ive never been here before replied chandler can you recommend a hotel with or without with or without what the driver shrugged whatever you want women men drugs gambling you name it without i think the driver grinned that may be a little harder this isnt the democracy you know chandler leaned forward and handed him a fiftycredit note why dont you fill me in he suggested you thirsty asked the driver should i be i can fill you in a lot better if my mouth doesnt go dry halfway through ive already given you fifty credits you can buy a drink after were through youve already made a couple of mistakes said the driver meaningfully i can tell you about them while we drink or you can learn about them the hard way suddenly im thirsty said chandler i thought you might be chuckled the driver by the way my names gin just gin gins my game gins my drink gins my name okay gin said chandler where do you think we ought to have this drink im already heading there said gin its not real fancy but they dont water the booze and people will leave us pretty much alone chandler leaned back and observed the city as the vehicle sped through it most of the buildings were centuries old and except for a handful of truly palatial structures in the downtown area they looked their age there was a definite seediness to the city as if most of the residents were transients small hotels and rooming houses greatly outnumbered apartments and restaurants and bars were omnipresent implying that almost no one ever ate or drank at home there was an almost tangible gloom partially due to the ambience partially due to the fact that hades cast its massive shadow across the moons surface here we are announced gin pulling up in front of a tavern that was indistinguishable from four others on the same block lead the way said chandler getting out of the vehicle he fell into step behind gin and soon entered the dimly lit interior there were some two dozen tables and booths half of them empty the other half occupied by men and aliens conversing in low voices a very tiredlooking woman was performing a very unenthusiastic striptease to recorded music in one corner a lodinite was observing her with clinical detachment while none of the other customers paid her the slightest attention how does this one suit you asked gin indicating a booth as far from the door as possible fine replied chandler both men seated themselves and gin raised his hand and made a swift signal in the air an overweight waiter arrived a moment later with a pair of greentinted drinks what is it asked chandler staring at his glass and frowning gin shrugged they call it a dustbuster on binder x here its a number five whats in it lots of stuff most of it good for you answered gin picking up his glass and downing it with a single swallow chandler raised his own glass stared at it for a moment then took a sip well asked gin itll do best damned drink you ever had and thats all youve got to say youre the one with the thirst im just here to talk right said gin signaling for another drink hope you dont mind he said but talking is mighty dry work i have a feeling that everything you do is mighty dry work said chandler sardonically now that you mention it said gin and laughed by the way you got a name chandler okay said gin with a shrug but if i were you id change it why why advertise that the whistler has come to port marrakech there are a lot of chandlers in the galaxy what makes you think im the whistler how many chandlers come out of the spaceport with five guns and a knife hidden on their persons grinned gin that was your first mistake my groundcars got a security system that registers on the dash i know said chandler calmly i spotted it the second you opened the door for me you did chandler nodded i figured it was for your own protection after all if it was against the law to bring weapons onto the planet theyd have stopped me at spaceport security makes sense admitted gin still there are ways of landing here without being spotted by morning everyone will know that the whistler is on port marrakech do you plan to tell them gin shook his head i wont have to by now someone in spaceport security has checked out your ships registration or run your retinagram through a computer or just outandout recognized you especially if you used chandler as your name so they know who i am said chandler so what from what i can tell this place is loaded with killers and worse you didnt come here for your health said gin ive heard all about you when the whistler shows up people start dying im not after anyone on port marrakech if i was nobody would know i was here yeah i believe you said gin he paused so what are you doing here youre supposed to be answering questions not me said chandler what do you think was my other mistake you asked me for a hotel gin smiled not smart a killer shouldnt let people know hes come to town and he sure as hell shouldnt let people know where hes staying unless what asked chandler gin stared at him unless you want people to know youre here thats right then you must be after someone on port samarkand or port maracaibo he frowned but that doesnt make any sense why would you land here why i landed here is my concern said chandler as the waiter arrived with another drink for gin you sure you dont want to tell me who youre after whistler ive got pretty good connections maybe i could help you find him he paused and grinned for a small consideration im not after a who im after a what information remember gin sighed have it your way i was just trying to be helpful youre not trying hard enough said chandler weve been here ten minutes and you havent told me a damned thing what do you want to know there was only one piece of information chandler actually wanted which was how to get to hades but he spent the next half hour asking numerous questions about port marrakech at the end of which he knew more about the local trade in drugs prostitution and black market goods than he ever wanted to know sounds good he said at last things have been slow on the inner frontier im considering setting up shop here youll have lots of competition in your line of work said gin not for long replied chandler gin stared at him and nodded his agreement no i suppose you wont not if youre half as good as they say you are could be that ill need a driver who knows his way around and can tell me where all the bodies are buried continued chandler yeah said gin his face alive with interest its possible think you might know anyone whod be interested in the job gin grinned youre looking at him youve got a job on a moon loaded with killers i like the security of working for the best killer of all well youre pretty good at talking ill give you that said chandler how are you at keeping your mouth shut you can trust me whistler if you come to work for me and i find that i cant trust you i dont envy you your death chandler paused do you still want the job what does it pay more than driving back and forth to the airport and taking kickbacks from bars and hotels and youll get it in cash i still need a figure after all ill have to use my own vehicle i gotta figure my expenses how much are you making now counting all the perks said gin it comes to maybe six hundred credits a week ill double it gin extended his hand across the table deal chandler took the proffered hand deal he replied youre on my payroll starting this minute great said gin there was a momentary silence uh what do we do now we finish our drinks and i find a place to sleep and then what eventually i wake up i mean what do i do youre on call around the clock answered chandler when i wake up in the morning i expect to see you parked outside of wherever i spend the night i also expect you to keep your eyes and ears open if you hear of anyone whos looking for someone in my line of work you tell me even more important if you see anyone watching me you let me know right said gin he signaled the waiter for another drink and you show up sober added chandler you got it by the way i dont plan to confine my activities just to port marrakech have you ever been to port samarkand or port maracaibo i know em almost as well as i know this port marrakech gin assured him good said chandler that should prove helpful he paused what about hades you dont want any part of hades whistler said gin they got nothing but these blueskinned aliens thereblue devils we call em even if you got a contract to knock one of them off youd never be able to tell em apart youve been there no but ive seen my share of blue devils uglylooking sons of bitches do any humans live on hades not to my knowledge answered gin he shrugged hell whod want to chandler didnt want to display too much interest in hades so he let the subject drop and spent another twenty minutes asking questions about the other two moons before he decided it was time to leave he checked into one of the better rooming houses paid for a week in advance and went to his room confident that hed made a decent start he was in no hurry to get to hades until he learned more about it hed go through the motions of setting up business on port marrakech and in a day or a week or a month gin or someone else would tell him what he needed to know about hades and the mysterious oracle in the meantime he might even accept a contract or two just to provide authenticity to his cover story he had shaved and showered and was just about to nod off to sleep when the vidphone blinked yeah he said staring at a blank screen you are the whistler are you not said a voice that might or might not have been human my name is chandler you are the whistler repeated the voice tonelessly it paused for a moment a word of advice whistler go home who is this demanded chandler trying without success to bring up an image on the screen i will not repeat my warning whistler said the voice i know who you are i know why you are here and i tell you that your mission is destined to fail if you are still here tomorrow morning your life is at hazard then the connection went dead and chandler allowed himself the luxury of a satisfied smile gin was waiting for him outside the rooming house when chandler emerged the next morning he had traded his company vehicle for his own somewhat battered landcar where to he asked as chandler climbed into the back of the vehicle twice around the block gin merely grunted and did as he was told when he had finished and was once again parked in front of the rooming house he turned to chandler no ones watching us no ones following us chandler corrected him theres a difference whats up asked gin nothing much said chandler i got a message last night someone doesnt want me here that figures said gin reasonably a man with your reputation shows up youre going to cost someone some business theyll have to learn to live with the disappointment i told you someone at the spaceport would spot you continued gin he paused so where do i take you now around around where just around i cant go into business if people dont know im here they know responded gin whoever tried to warn you off has probably told half the people he knows by now i say we go get a drink and think about this ill let you know when you become an equal partner said chandler just start driving suddenly gin grinned youre not advertising he said emphatically youre trolling you want whoever you spoke to last night to move against you so you can take him out drive just a minute said gin withdrawing a sonic pistol from beneath the seat he turned it over and checked its charge do you know how to use that thing asked chandler as gin pulled out into traffic maybe not as well as you came the answer but i can usually hit what i aim at chandler paused dont aim it at anything unless i tell you to he said at last gin nodded and tucked the pistol into his belt okay boss he said where are we going its your city you decide well i can take you to where the rich folks hang out or i can take you to where the people they hire hang out first one then the other gin stared at a poorly dressed man with bulging pockets who was standing on the slidewalk staring at them and as he did so the landcar came up fast on another vehicle gin swerved just in time to avoid an accident you keep your eyes on the road said chandler ill watch for potential enemies aint nothing potential about it muttered gin by noon you could have half a hundred of em out for your scalp dont let your imagination run away with you replied chandler as they began encountering heavier traffic dont let your confidence run away with you said gin the more i think about it the more i think this isnt such a good idea thinkings not in your job description said chandler until it is i suggest that you leave the thinking to me gin shrugged whatever you say thats what i say answered chandler suddenly he tensed pull over and stop the landcar came to a halt did you spot someone asked gin reaching for his pistol that alien said chandler staring at a bald blueskinned humanoid who was standing across the street is that a blue devil yeah so what chandler stared at it for another moment then leaned back and relaxed okay start driving again you didnt answer my question persisted gin why do you care about blue devils ive never seen one before you spent a long time looking at it i was curious they drove in silence for another minute and then gin spoke again why do you think a blue devil wants to kill you did i say i thought so you didnt have to gin paused but for the life of me i cant figure out why a blue devil would give a damn whether youre on port marrakech or not there was a long pause during which gin decided not to push the subject and chandler totally ignored it finally chandler broke the silence how long before we reach wherever it is youre taking me another couple of minutes give or take tell me about the area were passing through do you really care asked gin all morning long i havent been able to shut you up said chandler with an ironic smile now when i want you to talk suddenly you arent interested gin shrugged youre the boss this part of town is called little spica its inhabited mostly by descendants of miners from spica vi and shipbuilders from spica ii a few canphorites live on the outskirts but the spicans dont think much of most other aliens he paused theres a great whorehouse over on the next block if thats to your taste not especially see this storefront here said gin slowing down they say that santiago himself killed two women right there on the slidewalk about two hundred years ago and that bar there on the left best source of alphanella seeds in this part of town he paused again you ever chewed any seeds he shook his head and answered his own question no i suppose not a man in your line of work needs a clear head how many other cities are there on port marrakech cities repeated gin none there are a couple of little villages maybe five hundred people apiece halfway around the world farming communities mostly no most of the people live right here they drove out of little spica and into an even seedier area filled with the ornnipresent domed whitewashed buildings most of them covered with grime many in need of repair the alien quarter suggested chandler you got it mostly blue devils the rest of them are a pretty mixed lot have you ever seen an alien that looked like a turtle asked chandler i dont even know what a turtle is answered gin why just curious said chandler a man like you isnt subject to fits of idle curiosity replied gin if youll describe it to me maybe i can find out if theres anything here that fits the description some other time said chandler dismissing the subject they sped through the city gin pointing out sites of local historic and criminal interest chandler asking an occasional question during the next ten minutes their surroundings became progressively more elegant and finally gin slowed his vehicle and pulled up to a glistening hotel that looked like some ancient and exotic palace our first stop said gin this is the most expensive hotel in town chandler nodded then got out of the landcar you want me to come with you asked gin not necessary answered chandler ill be back in a few minutes he entered the lobby allowed the sparkling slidewalk to take him around a fountain that was engineered so that its thousands of jets of colored water met in such a manner that it formed an almost solid representation of a nude woman as quickly as the figure lost its structural integrity new jets of gold and red and white water would meet in midair reforming the figure the slidewalk deposited him at the registration desk where a uniformed man approached him from behind a broad gleaming counter may i help you he asked its possible said chandler do you have a carlos mendoza registered here the man asked his computer which replied in the negative thats curious said chandler frowning i was supposed to meet him here there are no reservations in the name of mendoza said the man well im sure hell show up sooner or later were fully booked for the next three months sir thats his problem said chandler with a shrug i wonder if i could leave a message for him certainly sir good if mr mendoza should show up please tell him that the whistler has completed his business here thats all not quite said chandler when mendoza gets my message hell probably give you an envelope with my name on it please deposit it in your safe until i come by for it i may not be on duty when you return said the man if this is a financial transaction well need some form of identification before we can release the funds to you sir chandler placed his fingers on the shining counter then pressed down on it did it register the clerk checked a hidden screen behind the counter yes mr whistler we now have your fingerprints in our permanent file good said chandler placing a fivehundredcredit note on the counter i am sure i can count on your discretion absolutely sir he picked up the bill and placed it in a pocket how can we contact you if mr mendoza should deliver the envelope ill contact you answered chandler turning on his heel and walking back out to the landcar he repeated the process at three more hotels when he emerged from the last of them he entered the vehicle leaned back and relaxed all right he said to gin i think ive announced my presence sufficiently i saw you slipping some money to each desk clerk noted gin are you paying them to spread the word chandler smiled in amusement i gave each of them five hundred credits not to tell anyone that i was on port marrakech let me get this straight said gin you want to announce your presence so youre paying them to keep it a secret i dont understand at least a couple of them will decide that if its worth five hundred credits to me to keep my presence here a secret it ought to be worth a couple of thousand credits to someone else to know im here he paused by tonight just about everyone who might want to avail themselves of my services will know im here gin grinned i never thought of that you didnt have to i did where to now if i werent on port marrakech and you had a sizable sum of money and wanted to have someone killed who would you hire id go right to the surgeon replied gin without hesitation the surgeon his real name is vittorio somethingorother but everyone calls him the surgeon he can slice you into pieces before you even know hes there where can i find him gin shrugged half a dozen places he gets around hes got a little action here and a little action there choose the likeliest spot and drive there this time of day hes probably at the wolfmans thats a restaurant over in the platinum quarter near where we were drinking last night the platinum quarter i didnt see anything that opulent last night its pretty rundown agreed gin but right before port marrakech was mined out someone discovered platinum and there was one last flurry of activity before they decided that there wasnt enough to make mining it worthwhile the platinum quarter is what got built over where the mine used to be the miners left so many tunnels there that you can get from almost any building in the quarter to any other building without ever coming up for air if you know your way around he paused every now and then someone who doesnt know the tunnel system goes down there and as often as not hes never seen again its not big enough to get permanently lost in commented chandler i assume these missing people dont live long enough to starve to death whistler we got guys living down there who havent seen the sun in ten years answered gin you pay em what they want for safe passage or they take it anyway and leave your corpse for the worms he paused again youve never seen anything like a port marrakech worm damned things are a couple of feet long and theyve actually got teeth you leave a body down there and they can strip it to the bone in less than a day pleasant place the men who live down there are worse than the worms some people say theyve got the worms trained to recognize em and leave em alone others say that they eat the worms to stay alive does the surgeon ever go down to the tunnels asked chandler from time to time course everyone knows who he is so they leave him alone mostly they make their money from hiding anyone whos got to disappear for a while and they pick up a little extra from people whove got no business being there in the first place interesting commented chandler noncommittally interesting hell its goddamned dangerous said gin devoutly if youre thinking of going down into the tunnels you and me are gonna part company ill keep that in mind they drove for another few minutes and then gin stopped in front of a small rectangular building that seemed out of place in this city of domes and angles there were no signs on the windows or the door but gin assured chandler that advertising was unnecessary and that everyone who had a reason to be there knew where the wolfmans restaurant was id better go in with you he announced as chandler got out of the landcar you go around asking for the surgeon without anyone knowing who you are and youre liable to undergo an operation you hadnt planned on chandler followed gin into the restaurant which seemed to be on the dismal side of normal with cheap chairs and torn booths scarred tables a very small bar along the lefthand wall and a surlylooking waiter and waitress standing behind the bar was a creature out of a childs worst nightmare it stood and walked like a man but its head was that of a wolf with a prolonged foreface and impressive canines its ears were not quite human and not quite canine but were quite large and pointed and set high atop its head its face neck chest and hands were covered with fur and it wore an elegant formal outfit that covered the rest of its body gin led chandler right up to it whistler meet the wolfman he said stepping aside i ve heard of you said the wolfman extending a hand paw im surprised i havent heard of you replied chandler reaching out his own hand cosmetic surgery yes why a wolf asked chandler why not was the reply as the wolfman made a croaking sound deep in his throat that chandler took to be a chuckle at least people remember me once theyve seen me he paused of course i can see where thats not necessarily an advantage in your line of work he stared at chandler why do i think you didnt come here to sample my food im looking for someone oh the surgeon hes not here answered the wolfman chandler looked questioningly at gin who had been studying the few occupied tables gin shook his head you might try again tomorrow added the wolfman hes one of my best customers he comes around four or five times a week the wolfman pointed toward a table near the bar one that backed up to a wall and gave the occupant a clear view of the doorway thats his regular table not anymore said chandler oh that table is mine now said chandler you might pass the word i dont know if the surgeon is going to be real pleased with that thats not my problem said chandler hes changing jobs or worlds its up to him does he know about it asked the wolfman he will said chandler if you see him first you can tell him not me friend said the wolfman i spent four years having this face created the surgeon could slash it to ribbons in three seconds he wont said chandler youre under my protection starting right now i dont want any part of this said the wolfman nervously he paused maybe youre as good as they say you are and maybe not but ive seen the surgeon you wont see him again said chandler remember no one sits at that table except me he laid a bill on the bar then turned and walked toward the door gin caught up with him just as he stepped outside boy i hope to hell you know what youre doing exclaimed the driver i thought you just wanted to talk to the surgeon if hes a reasonable man thats all ill have to do answered chandler but im setting up shop here this is the easiest way to establish my credentials and get rid of my biggest rival at the same time he climbed into the vehicle take me to the next spot on your list id like to get this over with before dinner gin shook his head in wonderment youre the first guy ive ever seen who was in a hurry to go up against the surgeon you look unhappy noted chandler i was kind of hoping this job might last for more than half a day said gin ironically it will i dont know about that said gin youve got some blue devil out to kill you and now youre going out of your way to confront the surgeon youre either awfully good or just outandout crazy i guess well find out wont we said chandler calmly i guess we will said gin pulling into traffic and heading for his next destination chandler leaned back on the seat and closed his eyes totally at ease he disliked waste and for that reason he was sorry that he was going to have to sacrifice the surgeon especially since they were members of the same profession but the surgeon was a vital piece in the game upon which he had embarked he had carefully mapped out his plan of attack just as he used to plan his safaris in meticulous detail and if he hadnt overlooked some hidden factor this would put him one step closer to the oracle if he survived okay were here announced gin getting out of the vehicle and approaching the dilapidated building wheres here asked chandler its called the dreambasin a drug den gin nodded the surgeon stops by here every couple of days curious how so asked gin professionals dont usually mess with drugs responded chandler it screws up the perceptions and destroys the reflexes oh the surgeons no seedchewer said gin but a lot of his clients are if hes here hes just tending to business they walked up to the entrance where gin uttered a password and smiled into an overhead camera the door slid back a moment later and two muscular men confronted them who do you have with you gin asked one of them hes my new employer answered the driver i personally vouch for him the man turned to chandler name joshua chandler where are you staying the souk answered chandler its a boardinghouse on the west side of i know where it is interrupted the man occupation tourist the man smiled well thats original anyway he held out his hand two hundred credits and two hundred more for your employee chandler handed over the money can we go in now as soon as you check your weapons with us does the surgeon check his asked chandler what the surgeon does is none of your business mr chandler was the answer if you dont hand over your weapons ill have to remove them myself he placed a hand on the hilt of his laser pistol as if to emphasize the point that wouldnt be wise said chandler softly something in the tone of his voice made the man hesitate either you turn them over or you cant enter he said lamely dont kill them gin said to chandler theyre just doing their job if theres any killing done here were going to do it said the second man finally choosing to speak you dont know who youre dealing with said gin with such conviction that the second man too seemed suddenly hesitant nobody moved for a few seconds then chandler removed his pistols and his knife and handed them to one of the men lets go he said to gin as the man stepped aside staring at him with a mixture of anger and uncertainty they proceeded down a long poorly illuminated corridor past a number of closed doors the sickly sweet odor of palyp an alien drug that humans had appropriated for themselves and now smoked in oldfashioned water pipes permeated the air they passed one open door and chandler glanced in four women lay suspended above the floor on cushions of air he couldnt tell whether they had been smoking or injecting but three of them were nearcatatonic the fourth her face contorted in agony saw him and reached out a trembling supplicating hand chandler stared at her for a moment with an expression of distaste then turned away and continued walking finally they came to a spacious lounge there were no chairs or couches in it just a number of large pillows on the floor some eleven men and eight women sat or lay upon them some in clusters of two and three some alone many of them looked bewildered as if they were just coming down from a high others looked anxious as if they were preparing for one a few merely looked bored there were half a dozen domarian actigraphs on the walls threedimensional creations of concentric circles and intricately weaving lines that pulsed with energy and had an almost hypnotic effect upon the viewer suddenly gin stopped and tensed where is he asked chandler softly see those two guys talking in the corner whispered gin indicating a bald rotund man dressed in a blue satin outfit and a small wiry man with a widows peak and an aquiline nose who wore an expensively tailored white tunic yes the fat one is omar tripoli hes a banker and he owns a couple of nightclubs in the antarrean quarter the little guy is the surgeon he doesnt look like much noted chandler the graveyards are full of people who didnt think he looked like much chandler stared at the surgeon for another moment then turned to gin wait here he ordered the driver hes probably armed whispered gin just do what i say answered chandler walking across the room and coming to a halt next to omar tripoli were having a private conversation said the surgeon without looking up i know said chandler then go away said the surgeon chandler remained where he was silent and motionless finally the surgeon looked at the man who was confronting him and got to his feet you dont listen very good do you i havent heard anything worth listening to replied chandler youre taking a big chance friend said tripoli not as big a chance as youre taking mr tripoli replied chandler what do you mean asked tripoli nervously you mean the surgeon hasnt told you said chandler with mock surprise told me what that hes leaving port marrakech this evening and going into a different business if i were you i wouldnt pay him another credit all right snapped the surgeon just who the hell are you your successor said chandler he paused i think if you hurry you can just make the flight to binder x youve got balls mister ill give you that said the surgeon i wonder how youll feel when you see them rolling across the floor save your threats said chandler calmly mr tripoli isnt impressed by them and neither am i suddenly a wickedlooking knife appeared in the surgeons right hand are you going to tell me who you are or am i going to have to take your id off your body ive no objection to telling you my names chandler i never heard of you thats just one of my names some people call me the whistler the surgeons eyes widened briefly but he didnt lower the knife or back away you can still walk out of here said chandler in fact as long as youre turning your business over to me ill even pay for your ticket you think you can buy me off with a spaceship ticket said the surgeon with a harsh laugh not really answered chandler but i thought id offer you the opportunity to live ive got a little something to offer you grated the surgeon he flipped his knife back and forth between his hands a number of times then lunged forward with his left hand extended chandler grabbed his wrist sidestepped the thrust and then more rapidly than tripoli or gin could follow delivered three quick blows one to the groin one to the adams apple and a final one upward against the nose forcing the bones into the brain the surgeon was dead before he hit the floor chandler picked up the knife and tucked it into one of his many pockets everything had happened so quickly that most of the people in the room were too stunned to react chandler turned to tripoli this is neither the time nor the place to conduct our business he said with perfect calm ill be in touch with you tomorrow or the next day youll find that my prices are quite reasonable for the services i provide in the meantime you might tell your friends that the whistler has come to town he stepped over the surgeons body and walked across the lounge paying no attention to any of the men and women who stared in awe at him lets go he said to gin they walked back down the long corridor to the dreambasins entrance picked up chandlers weapons and were in the landcar and driving away before anyone reported the killing that was some show you put on whistler said gin with the enthusiasm of a small boy for one of his sports heroes you were awesome well ive established my credentials anyway said chandler he paused it was a necessary if wasteful object lesson wasteful asked gin puzzled how i had to kill a man who had never met me who presented no threat to me and who was not my enemy wouldnt you call that wasteful not at all then its a fortunate thing that you dont have my ability to kill said chandler were growing a strange crop of assassins this season remarked gin amused this was not an assassination said chandler it was an execution well whatever you call it hes dead replied gin dismissing the subject with a shrug where to now whistler take me back to the souk replied chandler i think ive accomplished quite enough for one morning im going to read for a while and then take a nap just like that im sorry his death was necessary said chandler irritably i have no intention of joining the mourners id be surprised if there are any said gin he paused by the way i think you can expect the authorities to come calling on you as long as we confine our killing to each other they wont give you too much trouble but theyll have to at least talk to you just for show it was selfdefense answered chandler ive got more than a dozen witnesses true agreed gin he paused again you want me on call outside the souk not for a few hours answered chandler right now i want you to make the rounds and tell everyone what happened he handed a pair of bills to gin and since talking is such dry work you can use this to lubricate yourself with pleasure said gin taking the bills and stuffing them into a pocket i never liked that meanspirited little slasher anyway he was just a man doing a job said chandler from now on ill be doing it well youre the man of the hour as they say enthused the driver by tomorrow the whole damned city will know youre here to stay how soon will word of this reach the other moons asked chandler before nightfall gin assured him he wanted to ask if hades would hear of it too but decided not to the one person for whom he was putting on this performance already knew who he was and he would be surprised if she didnt also know of the surgeons death by the time he reached his rooming house it was a perfectly logical step for a man in his business to have taken you could work your way up through the ranks or if you were good enough and strong enough you could take on the top dog and assimilate his territory he had evinced no interest in hades had made no inquiries about the oracle nor would he he had come to port marrakech for business and he now had a readymade clientele to service it was as simple and clearcut as that the only question he mused wryly as the landcar pulled up to the souk was whether or not shed buy it the police woke chandler from his nap and took him to the local station to record his statement concerning the surgeons killing he got the distinct impression that they were just going through the motions that the death of an assassin regardless of the circumstances didnt bother them in the least when his deposition matched the various eyewitness accounts they released him with the bored instructions to keep within the law during his stay on port marrakech gin was waiting for him when the police dropped him off at the souk i see you had company he noted as the police vehicle sped away they werent any problem theyd probably have pinned a medal on you if they could have gotten away with it said gin the surgeon wasnt exactly the most popular guy in town neither will i be when i take over his client list yeah well in his case it was a matter of preferring the devil they dont know to the devil they knew i get the distinct impression that theyll leave me alone as long as i dont kill the wrong person thats about right so continued chandler i think until i know my way around a little better i might be well advised to confine my activities to the other moons and hades i can help you out said gin i know who to lay off of thanks for the offer but i dont really want to stake my life on your expertise okay said gin with a shrug have it your way but you might as well forget about hades there cant be a thousand men on the planet that implies theyre pretty important men said chandler someone might want one of them dead forget it said gin with conviction ever since the oracle set up shop there the place is a goddamned fortress who is the oracle asked chandler one of the blue devils gin shook his head they say shes a human woman i dont know if its true or not almost nobody ever gets to see her why would a human woman want to live on hades asked chandler beats me more to the point if the blue devils hate us why would they let her live there who knows replied gin i dont pay much attention to politics politics well maybe its not politics but whatever it is it doesnt concern the three ports and if they leave us alone thats good enough for me its interesting though said chandler a woman living down there why do they call her the oracle has she got a real name you got me said gin could you find out i dunno i never thought much about it gin paused it wouldnt do you much good though why not first because you arent allowed to land on hades second the oracle and the blue devils leave us alone and third because every now and then someone shows up on one of the ports and starts asking too many questions about her and then one day he just isnt around anymore so since you like being alive and i like being employed lets concentrate on the surgeons client list find out what you can anyway why are you so interested in her asked gin i never met an oracle before maybe she could tell me what numbers to bet on next time i play roulette you can make a lot more money just doing what you do best and you dont have to risk your life trying to meet her are you telling me that the oracle kills people whistler i dont know anything for sure about the oracle said gin in exasperation but i know the blue devils will kill you if you try to land on hades without their permission sounds like the democracy ought to move in suggested chandler we keep waiting for them to but so far they havent shown any interest in it he paused now can we let the subject drop you look nervous people who talk about the oracle have this habit of disappearing answered gin me i like it here chandler shrugged what the hell i was just curious its time to consider more important things such as such as dinner give me a chance to change and then i want you to take me to the best restaurant in town well add it to mr tripolis bill have you heard from him i will replied chandler confidently he has work to be done and ive already proven to him that im better at it than the surgeon he walked to the airlift ill be back down in about twenty minutes he went to his room took a quick dryshower shaved and dressed in a semiformal dark gray outfit that had been specially tailored to hide the bulk of three handguns one sonic one laser and one projectile then feeling somewhat refreshed and quite hungry he left his room strode to the airlift and floated gently down to the lobby well he said walking up to gin where are we going youre going to the green diamond said gin im taking my budget and my wardrobe to a place thats more to my taste he paused i can supply you with a companion if youd like some other time gin shrugged and led the way to the landcar and drove through the early evening traffic this looks familiar remarked chandler as they began entering a seedylooking area isnt this the platinum quarter not bad for a guy whos only been here once answered gin are you sure were going to the best restaurant in the city continued chandler dubiously its a private club said gin dont pay any attention to the exterior they dont want people wandering in off the street how am i going to get in if its private gin smiled word about this morning has gotten out you wont have any trouble youd better be right said chandler i dont like making a fool of myself trust me said gin pulling up to a dilapidated building the windows were boarded up the walls badly needed a coat of whitewash and the door was one of the few on the block that didnt boast intricate carvings well here you are youre kidding right said chandler this is the green diamond whistler just walk up to the door no password no secret knock look if you dont want to eat here just say so and ill take you somewhere else no said chandler were here and im hungry he got out of the vehicle and walked up to the door then turned to gin be back in two hours right said gin if you finish early ill be at the wolfmans its about two blocks north of here the landcar pulled away and chandler turned back to the door now that he was closer he could see that there was a very intricate computer lock on it and he spotted a pair of holo cameras concealed in the shadows he waited for almost thirty seconds then was about to knock on the door when the lock clicked and the door slid silently into a wall a short dapper man clad in green was standing a few feet from him in a diamondshaped foyer good evening mr chandler he said smoothly are you here for dinner or entertainment first one then the other replied chandler entering the building as the door slid shut behind him your table is ready for you said the man turning and walking toward a large crowded room just a minute said chandler yes said the man stopping instantly how did you know id be here tonight i didnt then why is there a table for me every diner has his own private table explained the man this one belonged to your ah he searched awkwardly for the word predecessor no one else may use it i see said chandler and your name is charles all right charles lead the way thank you sir said charles starting off once again he led chandler into a large room with a shining green floor and a prismatic ceiling that separated an artificial light from an unseen source into a variety of muted hues the ceiling was twenty feet high and domed at the top but the room was divided into some forty diamondshaped alcoves each with walls ten feet in height there were artificial green diamonds everywhere on the walls sunken into the floor on the waiters and waitresses elegant uniforms and in the center of the room was a large diamondshaped fountain charles led chandler to an alcove and suddenly the impression was one of intimacy rather than vastness chandler settled back on an expensively upholstered booth and a moment later a waiter approached him and rattled off the evenings menu chandler ordered a salad composed of vegetables grown on port samarkand and a mutated shellfish in a cream sauce very good sir said the waiter would you care to start with a fine alphard brandy we just received a new shipment this morning later as you wish sir by the way is mr tripoli here no sir if he should come in please tell him im here yes sir and if anyone else is looking for me let me know the waiter nodded and scurried off leaving chandler to admire that portion of the room he could see from his alcove a string quartet which had been on their break came out stood beside the fountain and began playing soothing if not brilliant music and a blonde waitress stopped by his table carrying an hors doeuvre tray he looked at the various selections chose one and a moment later his salad arrived he stared idly at the plate for a moment trying to identify the various alien vegetables and then he saw it maybe it was the light maybe it was the texture of the vegetables maybe it was simply the angle but suddenly he saw the artificial light reflecting off something bright he picked up a fork and dabbed at it gingerly then lifted it very slowly and brought it closer to his eye it was a tiny fragment of glass he moved a greenish leaf with his fork then found anothe piece and yet another he sat perfectly still staring at the plate while he tried to sort things out in his mind somebody had known he would be in the green diarnond on this precise evening even gin hadnt known where they were going until he had come back from the police station of course the driver had had time to tell someone while chandler was showering and dressing but he doubted it if he survived gin had to know that he was going to have to answer some difficult questions and hed already seen chandler in action that meant someone else knew someone who didnt have to be told where he would be dining who simply knew and that meant that the oracle was indeed penelope bailey the next question was more difficult why did his wouldbe murderer use ground glass when a poison would never have been spotted if the oracle had foreseen that he would be here then she must have foreseen that he would spot the fragments of glass was this just a warning or was there some limit to her abilities the iceman had said that even as a little girl with her powers not fully developed she could foresee potential threats to herself surely he was more of a threat alive than dead so was he being manipulated or had she simply proven to be fallible he didnt have enough information to answer the question so he let it pass and moved on to the next one somebody within the green diamond had tried to kill him who he stared at charles who was escorting an elderly couple to their table about forty feet away it was a possibility he looked for his waiter but couldnt spot him another possibility but somehow he didnt believe it ground glass wouldnt kill him instantly and his reputation had preceded him here they would have to know hed live long enough to take them both out before the glass ripped his insides enough to totally disable him then who he thought about it for another moment then signaled to charles yes mr chandler said charles approaching his table id like to see your kitchen he said certainly mr chandler were quite proud of our operation if youll come back tomorrow morning i shall be happy to give you a tour id like to see it right now im afraid thats out of the question mr chandler answered charles this is our busiest time of the day that wasnt a request charles said chandler charles blinked at chandler as his hand went meaningfully into a pocket youre quite certain mr chandler he said flustered quite might i ask why you might answered chandler but it wouldnt do you any good he got to his feet lets go please make no sudden or threatening movements said charles we dont wish to alarm our members follow your own advice and we wont have any problems said chandler charles turned and headed off toward a short but broad corridor that led to the kitchen then stopped before a door do you wish me to enter with you mr chandler no that wont be necessary charles turned and began walking away and charles chandler called after him yes mr chandler would i be correct in assuming that you plan to immediately summon either the police or a bouncer absolutely not mr chandler youre a lousy liar charles said chandler but there are two things you should know sir if you send a bouncer after me ill kill him and if you call the police ill charge the green diamond with attempted murder i beg your pardon said charles genuinely surprised someone put a little something extra in my salad charles said chandler if you dont want to call attention to yourself just leave my plate where it is charles stared at him for a long moment then turned and walked back into the dining room as chandler approached the door it instantly slid back revealing the interior of the kitchen to him there were numerous stoves grills ranges freezers and refrigerators and some six men and women and two lodinites all dressed in light green were carefully tending the food arranging it artistically on dishes or setting it carefully onto trays for the waiters who kept brushing past him none of them paid him the least attention then he saw what he expected to see a man and a blue devil entered from an alcove each bearing half a dozen salads the man noticed chandler stared curiously at him for an instant then shrugged and continued walking toward a large counter the blue devil took one look at chandler dropped its tray to the floor and ran back into the alcove chandler raced across the kitchen ignoring the yells and protests from the staff and entered the alcove the alien wasnt there but a door was just snapping shut and as chandler headed toward it it slid open again he found himself in a dank dimly lit alley behind the building and the blue devil was just disappearing around a corner he immediately gave chase and within a block had narrowed the gap between them from eighty yards to no more than forty then the blue devil ducked around another corner chandler followed it and suddenly found himself in a dead end facing the wall of a large building with the blue devil nowhere in sight he came to a stop withdrew his sonic pistol and surveyed his surroundings the alley led to a solid wall some twenty yards away and there were no doors on any of the buildings he looked up there were no windows within reach he walked along each wall there were no alcoves where anything the size of a man or a blue devil could hide he walked back along the buildings that led to the dead end and stood there trying to figure out where the blue devil could have hidden in the five seconds it had before he had turned the corner and then as port samarkand moved overhead and cast its light down into the alley he saw a manhole cover about ten feet away the blue devil couldnt have pulled it up and entered the manhole in five seconds but if he had been prepared for this eventuality if he had left the manhole uncovered and programmed it to close as soon as he plunged into it he would have just enough time to vanish before chandler came into view chandler frowned what was it gin had told him something about tunnels beneath the platinum quarter he considered going to the wolfmans and getting gin to act as a guide but there was no telling where the blue devil would be by then or even that he would still be in the tunnels and chandler wanted answers more than he wanted a guide his decision made chandler removed the manhole cover and pistol in hand entered the winding twisting world that lay beneath the platinum quarter chandler found himself in a small circular chamber with tunnels going off in three directions now he ceased being the assassin and once again became the hunter of the frenchmans world the floor was damp and he instantly saw that the water in a small puddle just in front of the lefthand tunnel was moving slightly as if someone had walked through it within the last minute or so crouching slightly ready to flatten himself against the wall in an instant he carefully entered the tunnel here and there he was able to detect signs in the millennia old tunnels that showed him he was still on the right track tiny disturbances that only the trained eye of a hunter could spot he wanted to increase his pace so that the blue devil didnt get too far ahead of him but the trail was difficult to follow and there was no sense racing ahead if his prey had turned down one of the many branches after ten minutes he came to a larger chamber and here he lost the blue devils trail for a number of men had passed through it even more recently no more than two or three minutes ago and had obliterated all sign of his quarry the chamber branched into four more tunnels and as he was trying to determine which one to follow he heard a slight shuffling sound off to his right he backed into the tunnel from which he had entered the chamber crouched down and waited a moment later a small man a laser rifle tucked under his arm entered the chamber looked around and uttered a shrill whistle the whistle was answered from the depths of another corridor he whistled again and again he was answered this time from a new direction i know youre here somewhere he said chandler remained still and silent come on said the man the more we have to look for you the harder itll be on you when we find you a second man emerged from a tunnel any sign of him he asked no said the small man but hes close i can feel it in my bones two more trilling whistles reverberated through the tunnels and in another moment four men all armed stood within the chamber come out now called the small man and all itll cost you is your money you make us hunt for you and itll cost you a lot more chandler heard yet another man coming down his corridor and quickly stepped into the chamber moving a step to his left and keeping his back to a wall drop the pistol pal said the small man as all four of them became aware of his presence and turned to face him when you do answered chandler the small man smiled there are four of us what chance do you think you have there are five of you chandler corrected him i dont want to kill you i just want some information he doesnt want to kill us laughed one of the men thats right said chandler the footsteps stopped come on in and join the party he said i think ill wait here until it begins answered an amused voice from the tunnel he had just left im looking for a blue devil who entered the tunnels about ten minutes ago said chandler his gun still trained on the small man have you seen him we ask the questions down here friend said the small man this is our domain and theres a fee for trespassing how much money have you got with you i dont pay tributes said chandler but i do pay for information ill pay five thousand credits to whichever one of you will lead me to the blue devil five thousand credits said the small man his face lighting up thats a lot of money to be carrying around with you friend too much said one of his companions way too much agreed another a man carries that much money hes just begging to be robbed he paused and leered i think were going to have to teach you a little object lesson about carrying so much money around with you youre making a mistake said chandler ominously the small man trained his laser rifle on chandler weve talked enough friend drop your pistol or i cook you right now the four men fanned out and chandler with a shrug dropped his sonic pistol to the floor where it landed with a noisy clatter glad to see youve decided to use your brain friend said the small man now it just so happens that the toll for walking to the next exit is exactly five thousand credits unless you happen to be carrying a lot more and if i am then wed be very insulted that you thought you could buy us so cheaply and when we get insulted we get greedy said one of the other men the small man grinned and nodded his head and nasty so i hope you only have five thousand credits said a third man approaching him you wouldnt like us when were nasty i dont like you much right now said chandler thats going to cost you another thousand friend said the small man or if you havent got it well take it out in trade now just hold still said the third man stopping in front of chandler and reaching for his tunic pocket or this is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me i doubt it said chandler he flexed his wrist and the concealed projectile weapon slid into his hand he fired pointblank into the mans chest then used him as a shield while he sprayed the chamber with bullets two seconds later he was the only man standing three of his antagonists lay absolutely still and the small man was writhing in agony clutching his belly in a futile effort to staunch the flow of blood you in the tunnel said chandler come out with your hands up he heard footsteps running away from him quickly stepped to the entrance to the tunnel and fired twice the sounds of the explosion were deafening but as they faded he was able to hear the weak rasping moans of the man he had shot he quickly walked to the small man and appropriated his laser rifle help me hissed the man the way you helped me asked chandler caustically im dying damn it youre probably good for another hour or so said chandler tell me where i can find the blue devil and ill send help for you you go to hell warm up a seat for me said chandler straightening up and heading off into the lefthand tunnel wait cried the small man weakly chandler tumed but did not approach him is there something you want to tell me a blue devil entered the tunnels about five minutes ahead of you where can i find him help me first chandler shook his head by the time i get you to a doctor hell be long gone tell me where he is and if i get done with my business in time ill contact the nearest medics and tell them where to find you they wont come down here thats your problem mine is finding the blue devil youll never find him without me ill never find him if i waste any more time with you said chandler ill make a deal gasped the man get me to a doctor and ill help you find him hell be back on hades before you can get to a hospital chandler turned toward the tunnel once more you cant leave me here thats precisely what you were going to do to me replied chandler you might consider it poetic justice who are you demanded the man im the man who killed you answered chandler heading off into the tunnel the mans protests and curses grew weaker and weaker and finally vanished as chandler turned a corner the tunnels were illuminated by a dim eternalight every ten yards and he soon saw a pattern to them most of the lights were purple but an orange one preceded a fork and a green one a chamber where two or more tunnels joined he continued going from one tunnel to another borrowed laser rifle at the ready from time to time he could hear the shuffling of feet in distant corridors but by the time he approached them they were gone he realized that if the blue devil knew its way around the tunnels he was never going to catch up with it and indeed it had probably already surfaced through some other manhole or exit but gin had never mentioned blue devils when describing the tunnels and the man he had just killed hadnt referred to the blue devil by name so there was a betterthaneven chance that the blue devil he was chasing had no more business being in the tunnels than he himself did and that in turn meant there was at least a possibility that it was even now undergoing the same treatment that he had been threatened with in that first chamber a green light told him he was approaching another chamber and he slowed his pace listening intently when he was within ten feet of the entrance he could hear two people a man and a woman conversing in muffled tones he made his way to the chamber in utter silence they both had their backs to him and were still speaking softly they say it was the whistler the man was saying he killed the surgeon earlier today why would he want to take over the tunnels asked the woman were small change to a high roller like him when you want to be a kingpin you dont worry about large or small answered the man knowingly you grab for it all well if he comes down here hes going to wish hed stayed up top hes already down here said the man who else could have killed boris and the others its got to be the whistler whistler or not if he shows his face ill slice him freeze said chandler softly stepping into the chamber not a word not a movement both of them tensed but neither moved nobodys slicing anyone continued chandler approaching them turn around they turned to face him youre the whistler asked the man some people call me that answered chandler youre not taking over the tunnels snarled the woman i dont care how good you are you cant kill all of us i dont want to kill any of you said chandler i just want some information then why did you kill boris and his men she demanded they wouldnt give it to me we dont turn on our own whistler said the man defiantly you might as well shoot us right now i dont want one of your own replied chandler im after a blue devil we got no blue devils down here said the woman just men he doesnt work for you at least i dont think so he entered the tunnels a couple of minutes ahead of me he paused i want him what for thats none of your business but it has nothing to do with the tunnels i want no part of them why should we believe you she persisted because the only other reason i could have for being here is to kill you and youre still alive said chandler the man and woman exchanged looks if we take you to the blue devil thats all you want said the man youll take him up top and leave the tunnels to us chandler nodded thats all i want and you wont ever come back down here again i cant promise that but i wont come back down without a reason the man stared at him for a long moment then nodded his head all right youve got a deal lead the way said chandler ive got to find out where your blue devil is first can you do it without leaving my sight asked chandler yes as the two men conversed the womans hand had moved down to her belt and closed over the handle of a knife pull it out and youre going to spend the rest of your life with one arm said chandler ominously dont be stupid snapped the man this is the whistler youre facing she glared at him for a moment then relaxed and dropped her hand to her side the man looked around the chamber picked up two small stones then walked to one of the corridors and clicked them against a wall in an irregular pattern the sounds were still echoing in the dank air as he walked to a second corridor and clicked them again he then repeated the procedure at the entrance to the corridor from which chandler had emerged its our own code said the man returning to the center of the chamber if your blue devil is anywhere in the tunnels well know it in a minute or two if youve called for help said chandler i want you to know that i have no intention of dying alone if we all keep calm nobody has to die at all said the man you just make sure you take your blue devil up top and dont come back they fell silent again waiting for a reply to the message about ninety seconds later they heard a faint tapping followed by a shrill whistle all right said the man turning to chandler weve got the blue devil lets go its not going to be that easy theyve figured out that youre the one who wants him he paused theyre willing to sell him to you how much asked chandler its negotiable youre sure this is the one who entered just ahead of me its the only blue devil thats entered the tunnels all night they know whats likely to happen to them down here he paused so are you willing to bid for him im willing to pay a reasonable price said chandler and if we dont agree to your price asked the woman still staring sullenly at him why dont we worry about that when the time comes suggested chandler he turned to the man lead the way the man headed off into the righthand corridor and the woman stepped aside to let chandler follow him you go next he said she glared at him but fell into step behind her companion and chandler brought up the rear they went almost fifty yards then took a hard left bore left at another fork and then began a gradual descent when they were almost a quarter mile beneath the surface of the moon they came to the largest chamber chandler had yet seen the blue devil was tied to a post and it was obvious that it had been badly beaten four men and two women stood near it and another man quite burly with a neatly trimmed beard and clad in colorful satins sat on a crudely constructed stone chair behind a makeshift granite desk at the far end of the chamber ah mr chandler said the seated man how nice of you to pay us a visit hes not chandler said the man who had guided him there this is the whistler that is merely his professional name replied the man at the desk he is joshua jeremiah chandler and he smiled he has had a busy day chandler stared at him but made no reply but where are my manners said the man rising to his feet allow me to introduce myself mr chandler my name is lord lucifer interesting said chandler noncommittally accurate was the reply lucifers domain is the underworld of earth and mine is the underworld of port marrakech he paused would you prefer that i call you chandler or whistler chandler shrugged whatever makes you happy excellent said lord lucifer with a smile i can tell that our negotiations are going to be cordial how did you know who i was i asked charles to point you out to me charles the headwaiter at the green diamond answered lord lucifer when i heard that you had killed the surgeon i knew it was only a matter of time before you showed up at the green diamond sooner or later anyone who is anyone shows up there and since i myself am a member i merely tipped charles to tell me when you had arrived he paused when i saw you enter the kitchen i became curious and when you didnt return i found out that you had left in pursuit of a blue devil had the two of you stayed on the surface there was no way i could enter the equation but on the chance that the blue devil had escaped to the tunnels i passed the word to my people to capture but not kill it on the assumption that it might be of considerable value to you if it was still alive he smiled again and here you are chandler looked at the blue devil does it speak terran if it was working on port marrakech it would have to answered lord lucifer all right said chandler turning back to lord lucifer how much well we must take into consideration that you murdered five of my operatives this evening said lord lucifer and then theres the effort we went through to capture the blue devil and theres my own time and overhead and of course both you and the blue devil can now identify me so i shall have to take that into account too the price said chandler in bored tones on the other hand i like you mr chandler i truly do how many men would actually place themselves in my power and continue to look so calm and collected make me an offer my friend five thousand credits lord lucifer shook his head sadly i couldnt possibly place such a small price on my fallen comrades i really couldnt consider less than thirty thousand chandler reached into a pocket and pulled out a wad of bills then peeled five of them off and put the rest back he then walked across the chamber and placed the bills on the desk five thousand credits he repeated you are either a very brave or very foolish man mr chandler said lord lucifer im on a budget lord lucifer threw back his head and laughed excellent he said at last i think you and i are going to become great friends mr chandler the smile vanished from his face you have the blue devil for five thousand credits on one condition what is it you asked if the blue devil could speak terran answered lord lucifer that implies that you wish to question it before killing it or giving it its freedom he stared at chandler my condition is simply this i want to be present when you question it why you have done no harm to any blue devil since landing here and i know that you havent been to hades no blue devil on port marrakech is in our particular line of business mr chandler so i would like to know why this one wants you dead still why dont be obtuse mr chandler said lord lucifer murder is one of my organizations most lucrative enterprises if the blue devils are thinking of going into competition with me on port marrakech i want to know about it i can assure you that they arent said chandler doubtless you can answered lord lucifer but i would prefer to hear for myself chandler shook his head what it has to say doesnt concern you let me be perfectly clear mr chandler my business interests start and end on port marrakech if the blue devil had any other reason for attempting to kill you it is of absolutely no interest to me if you are afraid that i will act on such information as i may hear let me assure you that i will not he met chandlers gaze i will order my people to leave the chamber so that only you and i are here when you question the blue devil but this is the only way i will accept five thousand credits as payment chandler considered lord lucifers statement for a moment then nodded his assent you heard us lord lucifer said to the others leave us alone until i send for you he turned to chandler if you should kill me please believe me when i tell you you will never live to see the surface again the five men and three women filed out of the chamber and chandler and lord lucifer walked over to the post where the blue devil was bound have you got a name asked chandler the blue devil stared at him and did not answer its name is boma said lord lucifer how do you know i wasnt in quite as much of a hurry as you were replied lord lucifer with a smile i asked while i was in the kitchen he paused its been working at the green diamond for about two weeks and i talked to the iceman about two weeks ago said chandler shes good ill give her that who is the iceman asked lord lucifer and what she are you referring to chandler ignored his questions and faced the blue devil when did she tell you to kill me boma two weeks ago or today boma made no answer can you contact her from port marrakech the blue devil remained silent how do i get in touch with her boma no answer just tell me how and you can walk out of here in one piece said chandler no answer youre sure it speaks terran chandler asked lord lucifer absolutely it understands what im asking it yes all right boma said chandler withdrawing his laser pistol she cant help you now only you can if i have to burn off one finger and one toe at a time i can then well go to work on the joints sooner or later youre going to talk to me boma looked into chandlers eyes never it said see you can speak when you want to said chandler now just tell me how to contact her and you can save yourself a lot of pain boma stared at him and made no reply last chance boma said chandler deactivating the safety mechanism and holding the muzzle of the laser pistol next to one of the blue devils digits you cannot win whistler said boma you think not she is the oracle the blue devil clenched its jaws together hard and instantly slumped over held upright only by its bonds shit muttered chandler forcing the creatures mouth open one of its fangs is broken off it probably had an oldfashioned suicide capsule in there he straightened up frowning i should have guessed said lord lucifer his face alive with dawning comprehension i knew port marrakech was too insignificant for you youve come for her you know about her i know enough not to envy you my friend chandler stared at the corpse of the blue devil for a long moment then looked up what kind of hold does she have over a member of an alien race that it would rather kill itself than tell me how to contact her that should tell you precisely what kind of hold she has mr chandler said lord lucifer it preferred facing you in the flesh to displeasing her from a distance of some miles and it preferred death to relinquishing any information no matter how trivial that might aid you he shrugged well nobody ever said blue devils were smart i dont quite follow you it could have told you anything you wanted to know explained lord lucifer why i should have thought the answer would be obvious mr chandler replied lord lucifer she cant be killed they were sitting in a small chamber whose leather furnishings and woven rugs were in total contrast to its stone walls and floor lord lucifer held a large sirian cigar between his fingers and was sipping a centuryold alphard brandy while chandler took a long swallow of his beer and then set his glass down on an exquisite table of domarian hardwood understand mr chandler said lord lucifer id help you if i could i would very much enjoy working with a man of your abilities he sighed i have no love for any human who has sold out to an alien race and i would certainly like the opportunity to expand my operations to hades itself but there is simply no way you can succeed youve never seen her replied chandler as far as i can tell nobody on this world except me even knows what her abilities are so why are you so afraid of her i know the power she wields answered lord lucifer it is not necessary for me to know how she wields it all right tell me about her power the democracy has never been stronger than it is right now mr chandler said lord lucifer it is expanding in all directions gobbling up worlds right and left it was all set to assimilate hades about fourteen years ago just a minute interrupted chandler i thought the democracy had no interest in the alpha crepello system once the ports were mined out thats the official story in point of fact the seventeenth fleet was positioned to shall we say pacify the inhabitants of hades then she showed up i dont know what she did but suddenlythe fleet retreated and hades was an independent world again i also know that the democracy has sent in five or six of their top operatives and none of them has ever been heard from again he took another sip of his brandy i dont have to know what her abilities are mr chandler i know that she can hold the democracy at bay and thats good enough for me in fact im surprised they were able to convince you to come here they didnt answered chandler im working for a private party this iceman you mentioned chandler nodded well whatever hes paying you it isnt enough he took a puff of his cigar what have you actually accomplished tonight you were fortunate enough not to die at dinner and youve killed one of her operatives and my answer to that is so what there are two hundred million more blue devils where boma came from but only one oracle said chandler i wonder if its possible to lure her away from hades how i dont know yet perhaps by killing more of her operatives lord lucifer shook his head im sure theyre all expendable why dont you just find some way to obliterate the whole damned planet and be done with it first because contrary to what you may think im not a genocidal maniac and second because my instructions are to kill her only if i cant bring her out bring her out chandler nodded shes a very valuable commodity nobody wants her deadunless it looks like they cant have her any other way he paused thats the real reason the fleet backed off when she arrived they didnt want to risk harming her youve piqued my curiosity more in fourteen minutes than she has in fourteen years said lord lucifer what is it about her that everyone wants what powers does she have just one precognition she sees the future as i understand it she sees a number of futures and by her actions shes able to bring about the one she wants thats some talent said lord lucifer admiringly how do you approach someone who knows what youre going to do long before you yourself know chandler shrugged i suppose ive got to put her in a position where there are no viable futures i dont see how you can do it from port marrakech i know they wouldnt give me permission to land on hades so i thought i might at least establish a valid reason for being here while i probed for weaknesses so thats why you killed the surgeon chandler nodded if a killer comes to town hed better kill someone quick or people will wonder what hes doing here he grimaced obviously it didnt work he paused frowning at least i dont think it did you seem puzzled noted lord lucifer i am if i fooled her why did she try to kill me and if she tried to kill me why did she fail ah said lord lucifer his expression brightening so she does have her limitations obviously proximity has something to do with it she could foresee that you eventually planned to kidnap or kill her because that would involve your being in her presence but she couldnt see what could happen here some miles away from hades he stared at chandler you look unconvinced mr chandler why it makes perfect sense to me if she cant see what will happen on port marrakech how did she even know i was here perhaps in one of those futures in which you confront her you tell her so and she worked backward to try to kill you chandler shook his head boma was in place at the green diamond the day after i accepted the comrnission and that took place a hell of a lot more than miles from hades an interesting point agreed lord lucifer they sat in silence each sipping his drink for a few moments youre going to have to go to hades you know said lord lucifer at last if she knows youre alive shell just keep making more attempts to kill you and youll never get her to come out to port marrakech i know said chandler my immediate problem is getting there then ill worry about approaching her oh getting there is easy enough answered lord lucifer expansively im not the lord of the underworld for nothing but what you do once you get there thats the problem you know what i have to do im not making myself clear i can smuggle you down to hades easily enough theres a transport ship for blue devils every other day and depending on how much money you can spread around we can disguise you as a copilot or navigator or at least hide you in the cargo hold but if you have no official status youll be picked up the moment you show yourself he shook his head no let me think further on the matter theres got to be a better way chandler stared thoughtfully at his beer glass why are you going to all this trouble for me he asked at last first because i like you answered lord lucifer and second because the sooner you leave the sooner there is shall we say a power vacuum at the top of our profession here on port marrakech one which i hope to fill myself are you a criminal kingpin a killer or what i am an opportunist answered lord lucifer calmly the surgeons death and your departure present me with an opportunity whatever your reasons i want to thank you for your help my dear mr chandler i have every intention of letting you thank me in a substantial manner before you leave port marrakech for hades how much do you want and when can i leave i dont know the answer to either question yet admitted lord lucifer he stared at chandler getting you there will be my problem staying alive until then will be yours he paused there are a lot of blue devils on port marrakech if she tried to kill you once shell very likely try again chandler got to his feet id better be getting back when youre ready leave a message for me at the wolfmans not the green diamond chandler shook his head and grinned wryly ive lost my faith in their cuisine poor charles i hope he doesnt take it personally lord lucifer suddenly arose id better escort you back he said it will keep you from getting lost and it might also add to the longevity of some of my more aggressive subordinates lord lucifer led the way through the labyrinth of ascending tunnels eventually they passed through the chamber where chandler had killed boris and his companions nothing remained but a few bloodstains here we are said lord lucifer when they reached the small circular chamber beneath the manhole through which chandler had entered do you know your way from here chandler nodded yes my driver should be waiting for me at the green diamond maybe ill walk over there with you said lord lucifer suddenly i never did get around to having my dessert and coffee they emerged into the alleyway then walked the two blocks to the restaurant theres the landcar said chandler gesturing at gins vehicle which was parked near the door to the green diamond gin saw chandler approaching and got out to open the door for him as chandler reached the vehicle lord lucifers voice rang out chandler watch out chandler hit the ground instantly his projectile weapon already in his hand as he rolled over gin was slower in reacting and screamed an instant later as a laser beam seared the flesh of his left shoulder chandler fired at the source of the beam and a body that had been hiding behind another vehicle fell heavily to the pavernent thanks said chandler getting to his feet and walking across to the corpse just dumb luck answered lord lucifer joining him if id been looking in any other direction id never have seen the movement he looked down at the body it was a human male youve got more enemies than you thought mr chandler you dont think he worked for the oracle asked chandler if he did he was the first human ive ever known her to use chandler crouched down and began going through the bodys pockets lets find out he said he withdrew an id packet and frowned you look troubled commented lord lucifer i am said chandler he tossed the packet to lord lucifer he worked for the democracy so it was the democracy that hired the iceman to bring her out im just the subcontractor then why did they try to kill you i dont know answered chandler he frowned again somethings very wrong here part the injuns book the darkhaired man hovered three feet above the floor sprawled comfortably on his airbed watching an adventure holo that was taking place about four feet away from him hey injun you got company said one of his guards over the speaker system suddenly the holoscreen deactivated and the door to his cell slid open a tall welldressed man with a shock of white hair walked in so youre jimmy two feathers said the man staring at him if im not youre gonna get a hell of a nasty letter from my lawyer in the morning answered the injun the man smiled they told me you had a sense of humor the injun shrugged and waited for him to continue speaking youve got quite a reputation jimmy as a comedian the mans smile vanished as he shook his head as a thief an arsonist an extortionist a blackmailer and a murderer the injun shrugged i take it you disapprove of versatility no said the man just of you you came all the way from deluros viii to tell me you disapprove of me said the injun what makes you think im from deluros i can spot you government types a mile away answered the injun and youre too well dressed to be from around here what else do you think you know about me asked the man you act like you think your shit dont stink that makes you military the injun paused i know i was flying pretty high when they brought me in but ill be damned if i can remember killing an officer you didnt what a pity said the injun lying back and relaxing arent you interested in why im here asked the man youll tell me when youre ready to im ready right now the man paused how would you like to get out of here i suppose i could adjust to it you didnt the last four times the injun shrugged a series of misunderstandings the man smiled caustically you call twentyseven dead men a series of misunderstandings actually i was performing a valuable social service most of them would have wound up in here look at all the money i saved the government you have no regrets at all do you well i regret getting caught youre a bright man jimmy said the man why do you keep getting caught you wouldnt be here if you hadnt read my record answered the injun you know why youre a seedchewer when im on the seed i feel like i can take on a whole regiment so sometimes i try to he grinned wryly next time maybe i should settle for a platoon youve been clean for two years now yeah well the prison chef doesnt serve alphanella seeds with the roast beef mores the pity the man stared at him and shook his head sadly you got a problem asked the injun youre the one with the problem answered the man youre one of the most brilliant criminals of the past quarter century you commit the insoluble murder or the perfect robbery and then you start chewing the seed and tell everyone what youve done i wish i knew what makes someone with your talents just piss his life away are you here to lecture me or offer me a deal asked the injun in a bored voice im here to offer you a deal answered the man you may not like it though im sure i wont but why dont you tell me about it anyway and then ill tell you what i think of it the man nodded all right by the way have you got a name you may call me well i was close said the injun i beg your pardon the injun smiled youre covert operations i thought you were military we frequently work in tandem answered calmly may i proceed be my guest what would you say if i told you that i have the authority to give you a full pardon effective immediately id say thats damned generous of you and lets get the hell out of here there are strings of course arent there always said the injun wryly you would have to come to work for me why am i not surprised and you would have to submit to certain surgical alterations the injun frowned just what kind of freak do you plan to turn me into i assure you that this particular surgery will make no difference whatsoever to your physical appearance yeah and just what are your assurances worth your freedom the injun stared at him for a moment then sighed okay go on the third planet of the alpha crepello system is home to a race of aliens known as the lorhn which are more commonly called blue devils over the centuries they have resisted all of our efforts to assimilate them into the democracy paused for a moment then began speaking in lower tones on alpha crepello iii is a human woman named penelope bailey a woman possessed of certain extraordinaly talents we have been trying to get her to return to the democracy for almost sixteen years thus far all of our efforts have failed what makes her so special she is gifted with the power of precognition answered do you understand what that means it means ill never bet against her in a card game sighed deeply i dont think you understand the gravity of the situation this is a woman who can foresee the outcome of various political and military actions and our best information is that she has become a renegade totally opposed to the goals of the democracy she is therefore potentially the most serious threat to the existence of the democracy and indeed the primacy of the human race that has ever existed and as such her continued presence is unacceptable how many men have you sent after her already what makes you think weve sent any asked the injun smiled you dont recruit from the jails until your own killers have failed stared at him for a moment weve sent eight men in we would have been just as happy to bring her out as to terminate her but new orders have just come down and that is no longer an option what happened to your eight operatives seven are dead and the eighth shrugged hes still there but youve lost faith in him no from everything ive heard about him hes as good as they come then why are you giving up on him because our policy has changed as i said the order came down yesterday that she is to be terminated the man who is on the scene had orders to try to bring her out alive hes already there why not just tell him that theres been a change in orders hes operating covertly in enemy territory answered we dont want to jeopardize his position by attempting to make contact with him he grimaced ruefully furthermore he s from the inner frontier and has no interest in or loyalty to the democracy hes basically a subcontractor whose sole loyalty is to his employer and it is possible that his employer has reasons of his own for wanting to bring the oracle out alive reasons about which we know nothing then why not just blow his cover if you think he might screw up the works if he can actually make contact with her where seven of my finest operatives have failed i want to know how he managed it besides continued there is no such thing as a cover when you are operating against someone who can see the future there is no question in my mind that she knows hes there i dont understand said the injun frowning and running his hand through his unkempt black hair if she knows hes there why hasnt she taken him out and why are you concerned about contacting him she can see what will happen but we dont think she can see whats happening now answered in other words she knows that he plans to abduct her at some point in the future but she doesnt know where he is at this very minute youre sure of that asked the injun dubiously maybe an hour ago she knew where hed be right now sighed deeply were not sure of anything we know what her capabilities were when she was six years old and from this our people have been able to extrapolate what they may have become then you dont actually know a damned thing do you said the injun no we dont admitted thats why i dont want to expose this man thus far it has been impossible to get any of my people close to her perhaps if he distracts her if her attention is divided between the two of you if he seems the more immediate threat you might have a chance you want a suggestion id be grateful for any suggestions you might care to makesaid sue for peace said the injun based on what you told me theres no way youre going to kill this woman all you can do is make her mad at you then you are refusing my offer who said anything about refusing your offer demanded the injun but id much rather die with a weapon in my hand than locked in a cell he paused and stared sharply at am i going to have a hand when youre all through with this surgery certainly answered i told you you will look exactly as you do now i know what you told me said the injun what you didnt tell me is what youre going to do we are going to turn you into a walking holograph transmitter said your left eye will be removed and replaced with a prosthetic one it will appear identical to the one we take from you and it will be tied into your optic nerve center so that you will be able to see through it but it will also transmit to me a threedimensional image of everything you see also a microscopic transmitter and receiver will be embedded inside your ear everything you hear will also be audible to me and i in turn will be able to speak to you without anyone else being able to hear what i say where will you be all this time shrugged thats undecided at present if i can land on one of the uninhabited planets in the system i will otherwise ill be on philemon ii the nearest democracy world about four lightyears removed youll be sending and receiving subspace signals the transmissions will be virtually instantaneous within a range of ten lightyears youve selected me because you think im good enough to kill her said the injun so why do you have to monitor me i may be able to help how all youll do is distract me i spent more time with penelope bailey than any member of the democracy except her parents yeah said the injun how much time almost six months sixteen years ago the injun snorted contemptuously forget the surgery and just let me get on with business there is another reason for the surgery said unperturbed by the injuns attitude oh you will be operating beyond the boundaries of the democracy continued based on your prior behavior there is every likelihood that once there you will take your ship and head straight for the inner frontier or if you remain in the alpha crepello system sooner or later you will be tempted to revert to your addiction and you think being able to whisper platitudes about duty and honor in my ear will stop me no said but i rather suspect that the miniature plasma bomb we plant at the base of your skull which i can trigger from a distance of up to twenty lightyears will act as a deterrent he paused now do we still have a deal the injun glared at him for a long moment then nodded yeah we have a deal you nogood bastard can you hear me jimmy two feathers grimaced and rolled onto his side jimmy wake up this is what muttered the injun wake up jimmy youre coming out of the anesthetic now im awake goddammit now leave me alone sit up jimmy go away i am away jimmy im more than five thousand miles from you the injun sat up groggily what are you talking about open your eyes jimmy dont want to my head is killing me it will pass it damned well better now open your eyes jimmy the injun opened his eyes and winced as the light struck his pupils both the real one and the artificial one its bright he complained thats just because your pupils are dilated theyll adjust in a minute or two the operation is finished asked the injun yes how do you feel now like ive been on a weeklong bender everything hurts especially my head we did a lot of work on your head look around the room the injun did as he was instructed and found himself in a large hospital room a nurse dressed in sterile white sat in a corner observing him intently from the smarting in his left arm he expected to find a number of tubes and wires tying him into a life support system but evidently it had already been removed from the room a number of small monitors were attached to his chest and neck but they were more awkward than painful very good said approvingly now hold your hand up about six inches in front of your left eye which hand either one the injun held a hand up the lenses adjust almost instantaneously noted now turn your head to the left and look out the window im not a puppet said the injun just do what i ask said i want to see how your vision adapts to a sudden change from a darkened room to sunlight then what i dont understand i dont plan to spend the rest of my life jumping through hoops for you said the injun weve got to test out your new eye jimmy the injun sighed and turned to gaze out the window excellent what next demanded the injun in a surly voice nothing answered everything appears to be functioning properly i assume you have no difficulty hearing me i wish i did your surgery doesnt seem to have improved your attitude said dryly i dont like having a voice inside my head said the injun thats not all youve got inside your head just remember that and well get along fine the injun made no reply and continued speaking now weve got some private business to discuss ask the nurse to leave the injun turned to the nurse he wants you to leave in a moment she said walking over and checking the readings on the monitors she nodded her satisfaction then left the room without a word youve got her well trained commented the injun she was only there in case your implants were malfunctioning it could be very disconcerting to wake up alone in a room minus half your vision and with nobody to talk to its disconcerting just to hear you talking to me youll have to learn to put up with it jimmy paused do you see the nightstand to the left of your bed yes open the top drawer and pull out the envelope thats in it the injun did as he was told now open it all right its open now lets examine all the material carefully continued the holograph on the top is penelope bailey at age six the injun stared at the image of a thin blonde little girl with pale blue eyes she looked drawn and tired and most of the color was gone from her cheeks the next holograph is a representation of the way we think shell look today barring extreme overweight or anorexia we can only guess at the style and color of her hair of course but based on her bone structure this is probably pretty accurate youve wasted your artists time replied the injun if shes as important as you think im going to have to plow my way through a hell of a lot of people to get to her ill know her when i see her possibly so possibly not even among primitive races the substitution of an expendable subject for the ruler is not completely unknown if you run into a woman with brown eyes or the wrong cheekbones this may help you then why the hell do i need a camera in my eye either you trust me to spot her or you dont i think you have a chance of reaching her a chance not a certainty i do not necessarily think that you have the skill or intelligence to terminate her without my help or quite possibly even with it is that plain enough thanks for your confidence lets be perfectly frank with one another jimmy you accepted this assignment solely because it is the only way you were ever going to get out of your prison again and you doubtlesss have every intention of reneging on your pact with me if the opportunity presents itself i chose you because i have lost a number of excellent operatives you are more adept at deceit and murder than any of them and you are expendable do we understand one another one of us does replied the injun sullenly then lets get back to business the next item is your identification packet we considered trying to change your retinagram and erase your fingerprints but there was still the matter of your voiceprint and if they found too many surgical changes youd be a marked man the instant you touched down therefore you will retain your real identity that of jimmy two feathers but we have changed every existing data base including the master computer at deluros viii to show that you are a naval officer who has been officially attached to our embassy on alpha crepello iii just a minute said the injun there are a lot of people on both sides of the law who know my name and my face what about them you will fly directly from here to your destination the embassy staff has been informed that you are working on a highly confidential assignment and they will be ordered not to question you about it or to discuss your presence among themselves i could still run into a bounty hunter or a pusher on the street i think thats highly unlikely jimmy youve been out of circulation for two years the average bounty hunter doesnt live that long still he added thats one of the reasons for your surgery if you spot anyone who might recognize you we will take him off hades if necessary hades thats the informal name for alpha crepello iii sounds like my kind of place i very much doubt it said to continue the next item before you is a map of hades as youll see its a relatively underpopulated planet for a world that size there are nineteen major metropolitan areas the largest is the capital city of quichancha which i am certain i am mispronouncing next is a street map of quichancha with the location of our embassy highlighted the oracle lives in quichancha asked the injun we assume so but we dont know for certain paused the next three packets contain all the information we have on port marrakech port samarkand and port maracaibo the three humanpopulated moons of hades what do i need them for if im landing on the planet we have safe houses on all three moons assuming that your mission is successful you may need a place to hide if your route back to the embassy is being watched the injun ripped up th three packets what are you doing demanded lets stop playing games said the injun i dont understand you if im good enough to kill the oracle im too goddamned dangerous for you to let me live every last one of those safe houses is going to be filled with people just waiting to blow me away if i want to kill you jimmy all i have to do is trigger the device weve inserted in your skull sighed ill have another set of packets on the three moons made up and delivered to you he paused theres only one item left are you ready to continue yes then pick it up and study it the injun held up a holograph of a tall moderately handsome man with auburn hair and pale blue eyes who appeared to be in his late thirties who is it his name is joshua jeremiah chandler should that mean something to me you may have known him as the whistler the injun shook his head nope he stared at the holograph again whats he got to do with the oracle hes our distraction paused he is a top professional possibly the best on the inner frontier hes operating at a disadvantage i had a feeling that the termination order would come through so he unlike you was not provided with these maps but that wont prove much of a hindrance to a man of his abilities hes currently on port marrakech but if anyone can make it to hades in one piece hes the man if that should happen you want me to work with him no the injun frowned then why the hell am i looking at his holograph we hope that hell take the oracles attention away from you after all hes a covert agent who according to my inforrnation may already have killed one of her operatives on port marrakech which means his presence is probably known to her however continued as i mentioned before his goal is different from yours if the oracle is half of what you think she is theres no way hes going to bring her out said the injun with absolute conviction i realize that the notion of kidnapping the oracle seems ludicrous admitted but to be truthful so does the thought of killing her if she has a weakness i imagine one is as likely as the other so what are you trying to tell me simply this jimmy we dealt with him in good faith and i dont wish to sacrifice him but if at any point it seems that he might actually reach the oracle before you do youre going to have to kill him it took the injun five hours to clear customs on hades which refused to honor the concept of diplomatic immunity the blue devils questioned him over and over again more than long enough for them to feed his fingerprints and the retinagram of his right eye through their computers and their allies computers and those computers of their enemies to which they had access and throughout the long interrogation kept feeding him the proper answers finally he was allowed to leave and found a driver from the embassy waiting for him lieutenant two feathers thats me answered the injun declining to return the young drivers snappy salute im here to take you to your quarters at the embassy the sooner the better grunted the injun he looked around where the hells my luggage its still being examined sir said the driver another member of the staff will retrieve it when its been cleared what do they think im smuggling anyway nothing sir its just their way of emphasizing their independence from the democracy the driver paused by the way i suppose i should introduce myself i am daniel broussard and i am at your disposal for the duration of your stay on hades jimmy two feathers replied the injun thats a curious name if i may be perrnitted to say so sir cherokee cherokee is that a planet not exactly said the injun lets get the hell out of here you can tell me your life story on the way follow me sir said broussard just a minute son said the injun sir my name is jimmy thats what people call me thats what i respond to you say sir and my first inclination is to turn around and see whos standing behind me he paused if you get tired of jimmy you can call me injun ill answer to either yes sir said broussard kids a real quick study muttered the injun under his breath he is to be your liaison jimmy dont start by offending him he didnt hear me i beg your pardon sir jimmy said broussard just talking to myself answered the injun i do it all the time these days dont pay me any attention as you wish sir broussard caught himself im sorry as you wish jimmy okay lead the way the injun followed broussard through the small spaceport and out into the hot air of hades where a land vehicle was waiting for them youre supposed to sit in back said broussard as the injun opened the front door i like it up front better view please sir ill get in trouble if they see you riding up front whos the enemy anyway muttered the injun the embassy or the blue devils you know who the enemy is theres no point in making more the injun climbed into the back of the vehicle and broussard started driving through twisting streets that suddenly widened and narrowed for no discernible reason the buildings bore no relation to each other nor to any other structure the injun had ever seen no two looked remotely alike some were tall others were squat some were round some needleshaped some trapezoidal some possessed so many sides and angles that he doubted there was a mathematical term that could properly describe them the street itself was as strange as the buildings it began as a gleaming superhardened ceramic near the spaceport became a potholefilled rubble in the midst of what seemed to be a commercial section constantly changed grades and inclines and moved from ceramic to dirt to gravel to plastic and back again for no reason that he could discern how the hell do you find your way around this madhouse it takes getting used to answered broussard swerving to avoid a blue devil who was strolling aimlessly in the middle of the street ive been here almost two years and i myself needed a guide for the first ten months or so none of the buildings are numbered and none of the streets are identified not even in their native language he paused most alien cities have a human quarter that makes some sense by our own standards but we have such a marginal presence here on hades that our embassy is right in the middle of their financial distnct if i were you i wouldnt wander out alone until i was sure i could find my way back once youre out of sight of the embassy you could get lost for weeks the citys not big enough to get that lost in its not the size but the structure sir said broussard many of these thoroughfares bear a striking resemblance to a mad city planners notion of a mobius strip they keep turning in upon themselves and though youre sure youve been walking in a direct line for a mile you suddenly discover that youre right back where you started wheres the embassy from here asked the injun as they passed a building that seemed tall enough to act as a landmark its no more than half a mile away though ill have to cover about five more miles of these streets before we reach it broussard grinned actually you could walk to it much faster than i can drive to it he paused you wont find it too disconcerting once you become acclimated im not disconcerted thats surprising said broussard most newcomers are you ever chew any seed son asked the injun no sir you ought to try it sometime then all the streets look like this one he leaned back and relaxed its like coming home youre kidding me right sir said broussard a worried frown on his youthful face jimmy right daniel they rode in silence through fifty more right angles and obtuse angles and hairpin turns and finally broussard pulled into the driveway of the one building that seemed to make any sense here we are sir he announced doors windows everything said the injun looking at the large embassy building i wonder how the oracle likes where shes living subtlety jimmy remember they dont know why youre here you ought to fire any of them who havent guessed yet replied the injun fire who sir asked broussard confused nothing replied the injun lets go inside he waited until broussard had entered the building then muttered you keep talking to me and theyre going to change their minds and think im here for the cure he walked into a large elegant tiled foyer the walls bore portraits of the last three secretaries of the democracy including the current holder of the office plus an artistic rendering of the sprawling planetwide city that deluros viii had become three uniformed men stood guard before a trio of doors looking neither right nor left broussard escorted him to a large office where a black woman dressed in a severely tailored outfit sat behind a polished chrome desk yes she said not looking up at him lieutenant jimmy two feathers reporting for duty he said weve been expecting you lieutenant she replied you are not on our duty roster so you might wish to spend some time settling in and getting acquainted with the embassy and its staff is there anyone im supposed to report to she glanced at a computer screen no you are to make your reports to your superiors by your own means the embassy is to feed and house you and provide you with a guide and otherwise leave you strictly alone she dismissed him with a nod of her head and broussard led him out of the office and down a corridor to an airlift friendly sort isnt she remarked the injun sardonically she doesnt have to be answered broussard as they floated gently up to the third level of the building shes commander ngoma the embassys chief of staff they stepped out into a corridor your quarters are this way sir said broussard heading off to his left they passed four doors then stopped before a fifth the computer lock is coded to your military id number since i dont know what it is i cant open the door for you how does the room get cleaned asked the injun curiously theres a small household robot in each closet dont let its appearance startle you it looks like a cross between a tree stump and a large snake thanks for warning me said the injun he approached the door and stared at the lock yq said the voice inside his ear he touched the appropriate numbers and letters and the door receded into the paneling very nice he said walking forward the room was quite long and very smartly furnished to his right was a bed with a nightstand to his left a sitting area with two cushioned chairs and a sofa and straight ahead of him facing a window that overlooked the carefully manicured grounds was a desk with a small computer this is the door to your closet said broussard and this is the one to the bathroom each will slide away as you approach it and the bathroom can be locked from within very nice indeed repeated the injun my most recent accommodation he smiled was somewhat more confining any changes or additions to your standing orders will be stored in your computer continued broussard it can be activated by your voiceprint and id number okay im impressed said the injun now lets get something to eat the commissary is in the basement sir ill be happy to escort you there he paused theres every likelihood that your luggage will arrive before were through the injun shook his head arent there any restaurants in the area restaurants sir repeated broussard surprised establishments where people who dont want to eat at home go for dinner said the injun sardonically possibly youve heard of the concept i have but the blue devils havent sir to them eating is as private and personal a function as well going to the bathroom is to us you mean theres not a restaurant in the entire city demanded the injun actually there are three sir answered broussard but theyre all in the grubbiest section of the city a section where the blue devils rarely go and they cater to all offworlders not just humans i dont think youd enjoy the experience very much sir choose one of the three and lets go the govemment will pay for it that might be unwise sir said broussard hesitantly we are not exactly the most popular race on the planet there was an incident between a human and two canphorites at one of the restaurants just last week i cant get the feel of the city by sitting here in the embassy ill be happy to drive you around and give you a thorough tour sir and i cant get it from the inside of a vehicle continued the injun you dont have to come along if you dont want to just tell me how to get to the nearest restaurant i wont let you go alone and i havent the authority to prevent you said broussard with a sigh so i guess ill have to accompany you sir fine lets go they left the room walked down the corridor took the airlift back down to the foyer and were soon outside in the incredibly hot air of hades is it within walking distance asked the injun i feel like getting a little exercise well yes and no sir answered broussard its probably no more than four hundred yards away in a straight line but well have to walk for almost a mile to reach it a straight line could get mighty lonely on this planet replied the injun lead the way let me suggest one last time that i drive you sir youre not used to the heat and it can sap your strength before you know it this is the best way i know to get used to it they walked past a large manysided building that possessed neither windows nor apparently doors then turned a corner and almost walked through the window of a crafts shop seventeen triangles of various woods and metals were on display and the injun queried broussard about them theyre not exactly religious symbols was the answer i mean they cant be equated with crosses i suppose theyre more of an emblem the way you might display a flag or wear a military insignia as near as we can tell each substance and color denotes a different ethnic group though i really dont know if the group represents a clan a business or even a military unit but its the most common symbol on hades broussard looked up the street which contained perhaps forty blue devils some walking purposefully some windowshopping a few simply standing still for no discernible reason youll see that about half of them have the triangles sir some wear them as pendants some attach them to their clothing some simply tie them around an arm or a leg the injun stared at the nearest of the blue devils then shrugged and continued walking a sickening odor wafted out to him and he peered into the interior of a building where he saw the corpses of a number of small sixlegged animals hung on what appeared to be meat hooks slaughterhouse explained broussard the blue devils like their meat on the high side stupid place for a slaughterhouse this looks like a retail area not really sir said broussard they dont cluster their businesses the way humans do in fact if theres any order to the way the city was laid out ive yet to figure it out are there any businesses or shops around here that are run by humans no said broussard the law doesnt forbid us to own a business on hades but as i said were not very popular here and except for a medical center no human enterprise has been able to obtain a license the restaurants are owned by a canphorite a lodinite and a mollut he pointed to a spherical structure about one hundred yards away thats the medical center over there its too small for a hospital noted the injun we have our own medical facilities at the embassy of course but this is for nonembassy personnel there are currently less than one thousand men on hades the center is more than capable of handling those problems that arise beyond the embassy compound you sound like youve been there broussard smiled not as a patient sir but the young lady im seeing is a doctor there i hope my presence isnt damaging your romance this is my job sir if i wasnt with you id be escorting someone else good i hate feeling guilty they continued walking through the tortuously twisting streets with broussard pointing out an occasional landmark or point of interest to the injun and finally they arrived at the restaurant it was a small building with an even smaller dining room there were fifteen tables nine were empty and the other six were occupied by a variety of beings none of them human as i told you sir said broussard as they seated themselves at a table near the door very few humans leave their hotels to eat no problem answered the injun i wanted to see the city they turned to the small holographic menu that hovered above the table and ordered it to list its contents in terran i wouldnt order the meat sir advised broussard it translates as beef but hades has no trade agreements with the democracy and actually its their local meat animal humans have some difficulty metabolizing it youre not going to tell me that youve all become vegetarians no the embassy imports all the food it needs from port samarkand but these restaurants arent owned by humans and they dont especially cater to us so i would consider their meat dishes suspect well i appreciate your concern but ive eaten animals on two dozen worlds and nothings ever upset my digestion yet he stared at the menu again for a moment then requested the dish he wanted as soon as it registered the menu vanished i think youre making a mistake sir said broussard with a worried frown the injun shrugged ill never know if i dont try you re being foolish jimmy the injun ignored the voice within his head and engaged broussard in meaningless small talk mostly about sports until their meal arrived looks pretty awful said the injun staring down at the bluegreen piece of meat on his plate we can order something else if youd like nothing ventured nothing gained muttered the injun he took a small mouthful and chewed it thoughtfully tastes about the way it looks broussard turned to his own plate a large salad and the injun took a few more small bites of his meat during the next few minutes then announced that his experiment in alien cuisine was ended and that he would dine at the embassy for the duration of his stay on hades you can share some of my salad if youre still hungry offered broussard no thanks that stuff killed my appetite the injun shrugged when all is said and done thats just what a meal is supposed to do i suppose i could get thin and healthy if i came here every night for a month he waited for broussard to finish left his thumbprint and id number with the tiny computer that had generated the menu waited another minute until the embassy accepted the bill and then the two of them left the restaurant he began complaining about the meal the instant they were outside and kept it up until they were within thirty yards of the medical center then suddenly he clutched his stomach doubled over as if in agony and began moaning in pain broussard decided that he was too ill to wait for an embassy car and helped him stagger to the medical center as he sat moaning hideously on the steps outside the building while broussard raced off to find a doctor he listened to s scathing lecture on the stupidity of eating alien food and managed to fight back a grin of triumph then he closed his eyes and collapsed he felt them lift him onto a stretcher and carry him to an emergency room then heard them leave in search of a doctor he cracked open his right eye looked around and saw a very worried broussard standing near him he sat up on the table and as broussard was about to say something motioned him to silence the young man stared at him curiously as he made writing motions in the air finally nodded in comprehension and handed him a pocket computer the injun examined the voiceactivated machine then shook his head and made the same motions again broussard pulled a pen out of his pockee found some paper on a nearby table and handed both to the injun dont say a word wrote the injun and lock the door broussard read the message frowned and did as he was instructed now find some cotton and some adhesive and tape my left eye shut broussard searched through a pair of drawers came up with what was required and taped the eye closed under no circumstances are you to speak until i give you permission is that understood broussard read the message and nodded still frowning then took the paper from the injun and wrote whats going on why cant i speak whats wrong wlth your eye i am here on a very sensitive assignment responded the injun i am not at liberty to tell you the details but it concerns the oracle a doctor began pounding on the locked door tell him to wait wrote the injun make up any story that will work broussard nodded walked to the door unlocked it and stepped out into the hall he returned a moment later all right he wrote now suppose you tell me whats going on the injun took the pen back during my orientation and briefing period while preparing for this assignment i lost a day somewhere i went to bed one night and woke up in my hotel room hours later bits and pieces of information that ive been able to piece together lead me to believe that i have been tampered with in what way asked broussard i suspect that i have had a camera and an audio transmitter implanted inside my head why didnt you report this to your superiors at the time because i dont know which of them is in the employ of the oracle if i told the wrong one i would have been terminated instantly i made up my mind not to do anything about it until i reached hades broussard stared at him for a long moment what if youre wrong if im wrong youve been inconvenienced for ten minutes and ive made a fool of myself but no harm has been done and no false accusations have been made but if im right then our covert operations branch has a traitor in its midst why would they rig you with a camera and an audio receiver asked broussard the injun shrugged any number of reasons the oracle could be testing her security she could be creating a file on all the humans on hades she could merely be hoping that ill have access to secret information so what do we do now asked broussard now we get someone you can trust maybe your lady friend who works here and we remove whatevers been implanted whlle whoevers at the other end still thinks im being treated for a bellyache broussard looked thoughtful shes not the doctor i just spoke to but i know shes on duty he paused but id have to tell her whats going on can you trust her to keep quiet broussard nodded okay get her and tell her shes got to work fast it cant take that long to pump out a stomach full of bad food broussard smiled and took the pen back ill have her make a couple of statements about sedating you that should buy us a good eight to ten hours the young man turned to leave but the injun grabbed him by the arm one last thing he wrote im assuming a camera and a receiver but there could be more things in there tell her to remove anything she finds broussard nodded again then walked to the door and left the emergency room he was back some ten minutes later with a pretty but grimfaced young woman in tow she immediately took a pen out of her pocket and wrote a message on a notepad i am dr jill huxley daniel has explained your situation to me and has vouched for your credentials then lets get on with it wrote the injun youve been a very foolish man mr two feathers she said aloud daniel warned you against eating alien food he managed a groan its nothing lifethreatening she continued while writing on her notepad and ive got a couple of patients who are in immediate need of my services im going to sedate you now and ill get around to emptying your stomach as soon as i get a chance she tore off a sheet and handed it to him i will have to move you to an operating theater it read and since this is to be done in absolute secrecy i will have to ask daniel to assist me broussard read the message over her shoulder and suddenly looked somewhat ill how long will it take asked the injun if you have been tampered with it will take me about an hour to run a scan on your head and have the computer construct a holographic analog the actual surgery will last anywhere from one to four hours depending on how deeply embedded the devices are if youre ready nod your head and ill send for some attendants to move you the injun nodded then lay back and waited two husky young men arrived a moment later transferred him to an operating room and then departed broussard had remained with him and jill huxley arrived almost ten minutes later what was the delay asked the injun she held up a pair of treated contact lenses then placed them in a pocket if youve got a camera in there it wont stop functioning just because youre unconscious i realize that your eyes will be closed initially but if i have to remove the camera it will record what is happening once i open the eye that contains it once i determine that a camera indeed exists ill insert the lenses in my eyes darken the room and operate in infrared light only good thinking wrote the injun i never considered that theres no need to anesthetize you until we determine that surgery is indicated she continued the scanning process itself is quite painless he nodded his agreement and a moment later she had wheeled him under a large device that looked like a cross between a punch press and an oversized camera it is essential that you hold still for the next twenty seconds she wrote he made no reply but simply handed the notepad back to her and stared up at the machine it began whirring softly and deep within its lens a small reddish light glowed faintly he felt neither discomfort nor pain and finally the whirring stopped the light went out and broussard wheeled him away jill huxley gestured him to join her at a bank of computers along the far wall one by one each screen came to life displaying readouts that were totally meaningless to him but finally one of them produced a threediminsional rendering of his head with three blinking yellow dots one in his left eye one deep inside his right ear and one at the base of his skull have you any idea what this one might be she asked pointing to the third dot he shrugged whatever it is it doesnt belong there take it out she ignored him for the next half hour creating cross sections of his head on her various machines checking and crosschecking the best routes to reach the artificial implants finally she picked up the notepad and began writing again i can remove two of the devices but there may be a problem with the one in your eye its tied into the optic nerves so intricately that i might cause irreparable damage if i removed it remove it and give me a prosthetic eye he answered she shook her head once the optic nerves are damaged it requires a specialist to implant a functioning prosthetic eye and prostheses are not my field she paused and stared at him then wrote you have a decision to make mr two feathers i can leave the camera in or you can awaken with vision in only your right eye theres no third option the injun lowered his head in thought he didnt especially give a damn whether could see what he was doing or not his prime concern was to get rid of the explosive device and secondarily to find a way to silence the voice within his head but he had sold these two a story and his answer would have to comply with it if he wanted to retain his vision finally he bent over the notepad and began writing youd better leave it in theres no way i can replace the eye on hades and my mission may place me in hazardous situations where depth perception is essential whoever implanted it has already seen daniels face and knows what my quarters look like if i make sure that i spend a minimal amount of time at the embassy i probably wont be revealing anything that the traitor doesnt already know but you will still be transmitting everything you see to the oracle wrote jill wont that totally neutralize you ill wear an eyepatch he wrote smiling as the thought came to him ill remove lt only if and when i require the use of both eyes all right she replied perhaps its just as well i was uncomfortable about operating in infrared light ill prepare the anesthetic one more thing he wrote grabbing the notepad back from her it occurs to me that the device at the base of my skull may have been placed there as a means of controlling or destroying me if i get too close to the oracle have you anything that can analyze it i doubt it then to be on the safe side get rid of it as quickly as possible should i get rid of the receiver too she asked no he replied its harmless once its been removed and it might tell me something about the nature and even the identity of the enemy save it for me she nodded remove your tunic and then lie back on the table im going to inject you with an anesthetic which will work almost instantaneously one last thing that alien meat really is making me sick can you pump my stomach out while im unconscious yes she wrote thats pretty terrible stuff im surprised youre not in even more discomfort he removed his tunic tossed it to broussard who was standing around looking both uncomfortable and useless and then he lay down on the table suddenly he sat up and gestured for the notepad again dont speak once youve removed the audio transmitter theres every possibility that it will still be functional im well aware of that she replied then aloud she said well as long as hes sedated theres no sense bringing him out of it lets go to work and when he wakes up with the granddaddy of all stomachaches maybe itll encourage him to be a little more intelligent about his choice of food next time he visits an alien restaurant sounds good to me doctor replied broussard disguising his voice then she leaned over and injected something into the injuns left arm and he tried mentally counting backward from he was unconscious before he hit a voice disturbed the darkness that enveloped him how do you feel the injun moaned and tried to turn away then winced as his right ear touched his pillow wake up lieutenant two feathers go away the surgerys over lieutenant said broussard its time to get up now what time is it almost morning all right give me a minute to clear my head he lay motionless trying to remember all the events of the previous evening until they finally came into focus how did it go about as anticipated answered broussard she removed the transmitter and the explosive and left the camera in he paused she woke you and checked you out briefly right afterward then had me move you here for a few more hours the injun sat up abruptly then moaned and held his head no sudden movements for another day said broussard who was sitting in a chair by the foot of the bed jesus it feels like someones inside my head hammering to get out jill said youd have quite a headache when you woke up was the thing at the base of my skull a bomb asked the injun yes where is it we dissolved it in acid can you dissolve a bomb in acid asked the injun dubiously you can when its an organic device like a plasma bomb answered broussard the trick was getting it out without triggering it he smiled thats why youve got a headache what about the transmitter its in the next room said broussard i didnt think youd want it around until we had talked i can destroy it if you like not yet said the injun he paused am i on any medication she loaded you up with antibiotics and glucose before she brought you in here and youll be on pain medication for a couple of days things look different said the injun frowning i took the liberty of putting an eyepatch on you answered broussard you can remove it whenever you want but until i knew what you planned to do it seemed best not to let the person at the other end of the camera know that you were awake and in a hospital room good thinking said the injun approvingly do you think youre up to some breakfast yeah i could do with some in a few minutes answered the injun except for four or five bites of that alien meat i havent had anything to eat since i arrived at the embassy yesterday afternoon speaking of the embassy im going to have to report in to them in the next few minutes before they start sending out search parties broussard paused i called them right after we wheeled you out of surgery and gave them some cockandbull story about your having a liaison with a girl you had met but theyre going to start getting nervous before long how soon can i get on my feet whenever you want okay said the injun give me another hour and then take me back to the embassy i dont think you can walk that far in your current condition sir said broussard perhaps id better get the landcar and come back for you the injun nodded then winced as a bolt of pain shot through his skull damn he said how long is this going to keep up what sir every time i move my head it feels like someones hitting it with a blunt instrument i really couldnt say sir i only know that jill said there would be some discomfort for a day or two discomfort to a doctor is the torture of the damned to his patients get me the painkiller broussard reached into his pocket and withdrew a small inhaler take one breath of this every four hours the injun grabbed it from him inserted it into a nostril and took two deep sniffs i havent got time for a slow recovery is there anything else i can do for you before i leave for the landcar sir two things first where are my clothes broussard walked to a closet and ordered the door to open right here sir and the second thing bring me the transmitterand dont make a sound while youre doing it then get the vehicle and pick me up in an hour broussard left the room and returned a moment later with an incredibly miniaturized device which rested on a soft sponge he handed it to the injun saluted and left the room the injun waited until the door slid shut then inserted the device into his left ear good morning you son of a bitch he said hows your stomach feeling today jimmy asked his voice sounding distant and tinny never better i trust youve learned your lesson you wouldnt believe all the things ive learned said the injun there was a long silence arent you going to ask said the injun at last ask what replied why you cant see anything i assume youve got your eyes closed one of em anyway this is a very juvenile display of petulance jimmy said im here to help you and i cant do that if i cant see what youre seeing actually im here to help you replied the injun and i think the first thing im going to help you do is renegotiate my contract what are you getting at jimmy were about to change the ground rules said the injun how badly do you want the oracler very badly you know that how much are you willing to pay weve already got a deal jimmy said your freedom in exchange for the oracle my freedom was just the down payment said the injun leaning back carefully against a pillow and wincing again now were going to start talking money forget it jimmy im not going to let you or anyone else take advantage of the democracy whos taking advantage said the injun i want an honest days pay for an honest days work youve never done an honest days work in your life answered we have an agreement and youre going to stick to it no im afraid not let me remind you that i possess the ability to terrninate our agreement rather forcefully whenever choose youre welcome to try why are you talking like this demanded whats come overyou jimmy nothings come over me answered the injun but a lot has come out of me want to see he withdrew the transmitter then faced a wall so that couldnt pinpoint his location from the view out the window removed his eyepatch with his free hand and stared at the tiny object look familiar he asked there was no response and he realized that even if was speaking he couldnt hear it until he reinserted the transmitter into his ear he covered his eye once again and then carefully put the transmitter back in place was just coming to the end of a long string of obscenities id show you the bomb too but its already been destroyed the injun grinned again are you ready to talk price thats extortion and i dont deal with extortionists no you just wire them for sight sound and extermination you go after the oracle on our onginal terms or youre a dead man jimmy i cant tell you how frightened that makes me feel im not kidding jimmy you may be able to hide for an hour or a day or possibly even a week but i promise youll never get off that planet maybe i dont want to what are you talking about the reason were going to negotiate a price no matter how loudly you protest said the injun is because youre not the only game in town who else is there i figure there are at least two other players answered the injun first of all theres the guy whos coming to take her out you dont even know who he is youve already told me the name he uses and if he makes it here he wont be that hard to spot he paused once he learns that the democracy wants him dead i figure he ought to be more than happy to pay me to learn the identity of the man who doublecrossed him whos the other party i would have thought that would be obvious replied the injun theres the oracle youd sell your own race out i dont believe it ive got nothing against her answered the injun shes never done me any harm which is more than i can say for some members of my own race this is more than extortion snapped furiously its treason no said the injun its business he paused now i can transact it with you or i can transact it with someone else thats the only decision youve got to make and youve got exactly five minutes in which to make it if we reach an agreement in that time ill return to the embassy and go to work for you if not i guarantee you wont find me before i find the whistler and the oracle made no reply and the injun started counting down the seconds in his mind four minutes he announced still there was no reply three minutes how much do you want asked in strained tones im a reasonable man said the injun you keep telling me that the oracle is probably the greatest potential threat the democracy has ever faced i dont think ten million credits is out of line ten million youre crazy come on said the injun easily you spend billions of credits waging wars against races that are no threat to you at all i would think youd jump at the chance to be rid of the oracle for only ten million there was a lengthy pause payable upon completion of the job the injun laughed aloud ive lost my faith in the democracy i want half down and the other half where i can get it when the jobs done give me a bank and an account number and ill have five million credits transferred there by tomorrow morning im not that dumb even when im on the seed said the injun itll go through so many middlemen that youll lose track of it before its halfway to its destination and i dont go to work until its where i want it to be he gave the first step of the money route what assurances do i have that youll go through with it once the moneys in place none answered the injun consider it an act of faith he paused have we got a deal there was a short pause ill have to think it over think fast youve got less than a minute left will you reinsert the transmitter so that i can monitor your progress not a chance i work alone another pause all right its a deal but thought the injun with a grin as he tossed the transmitter into an atomizer and began getting dressed we didnt shake on it the injun lay back on his bed staring at various two and threedimensional prints on the beige walls and wishing that the embassy had hired a bolder decorator when the throbbing in his right ear and at the base of his skull finally began to subside he decided to begin working computer activate he ordered the computer on his desk hummed to life computer do you know who i am you are lieutenant james two feathers do you know the nature of my assignment on hades no i do not is anyone currently monitoring my room no is anyone currently monitoring my conversation with you he continued no have i the authority to keep it that way i do not understand lieutenant two feathers answered the computer you must word your questions more precisely is there a way that i can prevent anyone from monitoring this room no can you warn me if and when the room is being monitored yes i order you to do so order received and enacted good the injun paused trying to formulate his request properly i dont want anyone to know what information i am about to request of you is there a way to make this and all future conversations between you and me private so that no one else can access them yes how do i go about it you must instruct me to seal your work under a priority restriction please seal all my work under a priority restriction order received and enacted all right said the injun now lets get to work he paused as another surge of pain shot through his inner ear then continued speaking after it had passed i have two missions on hades one is to assassinate the human woman known as the oracle the other is to prevent a man who is somewhere within the alpha crepello system from reaching her before i do if i make contact with him there is a possibility that i may have to kill him will your programming allow you to help me yes replied the computer helping you accomplish your mission will not set up any ethical conflicts within me good do you have any information in your memory banks concerning a mercenary or bounty hunter who uses the professional name of the whistler no he comes from the inner frontier can you access a computer that may have some information about him possibly silence well demanded the injun you made no request lieutenant two feathers try to access a computer that can supply you with data about the whistler and if you are successful transmit that information to me working there was a threeminute silence during which time the injun lay absolutely still and hoped the pain within his head would diminish it had just begun to subside slightly when the computer spoke again the man known as the whistler is actually joshua jeremiah chandler he is thirtyeight years old he is six feet two inches tall weighs pounds and has auburn hair and blue eyes he has no distinguishing scars or birthmarks his home planet is boyson iii which is known locally as the frenchman s world he is a bounty hunter who has made twentyseven reported kills and has brought in eleven living fugitives it is assumed that he has made even more unreported kills but the number cannot be ascertained impressive said the injun can you supply me with a photograph or holograph of him yes the injun waited for a few seconds then grimaced please do so instantly a holograph of chandler taken from his passport flashed on the small screen im too far away to see it said the injun make it larger suddenly an image of chandlers holograph some four feet on a side popped into existence just above the desk the injun studied the pale blue eyes the high cheekbones the humorless expression trying without success to get some feel of the man from his image do you know if hes landed on hades yet no no he hasnt landed no i do not know dont all humans have to report to the embassy yes answered the computer but my understanding is that residents of the inner frontier do not recognize the authority of the democracy therefore it is possible that he has landed without reporting his presence to the embassy can you check it out with spaceport security no i am denied access to the spaceport computer i see said the injun he paused still trying to order his thoughts his assignment is to kidnap the human woman known as the oracle what in your opinion is his most likely course of action he will come to hades gain access to her and forcibly remove her from the planet the injun grimaced again lets take this one step at a time if he wanted to come to hades and keep his presence unknown how would he do so he would not report his presence to the embassy that would just keep his presence unknown to you how would he keep it unknown to the blue devils he has two options answered the computer either he will have to keep his arrival secret from the spaceport security system or he will have to disguise his identity how many humans have managed to avoid spaceport security i have insufficient data to answer that question how many are you aware of none then lets assume it cant be done and that hell be disguised said the injun what type of disguise is least likely to be penetrated by spaceport security i have insufficient data to answer that question you mean nobodys ever done it if it has been done successfully by its very nature i am not aware of it answered the computer the injun paused while he digested the information then spoke again hypothesize that hell accomplish it where will he go next i have insufficient data to answer that question you are a goddamned pain in the ass snapped the injun all right let me restate it if a human doesnt stay at the embassy where is he most likely to stay there are four hotels that accept humans answered the computer none of their names can be pronounced or spelled in terran they are codenamed blue house red house white house and green house by members of the embassy staff they dont cater exclusively to humans i take it that is correct now hypothesize that hell stay in one of the hotels lets assume blue house his next step will be to determine where to find the oracle how will he go about this first he will use the vidphone directory then he will ask at the embassy then stop commanded the injun the computer was instantly silent he doesnt want his presence known remember asking the embassy is like waving a flag i do not understand the reference look said the injun irritably there are certain facts that you must take into consideration for this hypothesis first the whistler is here illegally and if his presence is discovered he will either be imprisoned or deported or possibly even executed second he may already be aware of the fact that the democracy does not want him to succeed in his mission and has ordered his death third the oracle is under the protection of the blue devils and they will almost certainly be suspicious of anyone who asks questions about her now taking his need for absolute secrecy into account how do you think he will go about locating her i have insufficient data to respond to that question why exploded the injun sitting up in frustration and groaning at the sudden sharp pain inside his head while i have the ability to shield certain files against scrutiny i myself have not been programmed to initiate covert activities im just asking you to hypothesize darnn it i am incapable of attempting this hypothesis the injun lay back on the bed propped his head up against a pillow closed his eyes and waited for the pain to pass youre driving me crazy he muttered at last the machine made no response okay said the injun as the pain subsided again lets skip the whistler for a while and concentrate on the oracle what information do you have on her the oracle is known to exist there was a long pause thats it said the injun unbelievingly as his whole body tensed in frustration and the pain returned that is my only verifiable information everything else in my data banks is supposition or hypothesis give it to me anyway the oracle is believed to be penelope bailey age twentytwo the oracle is believed to be in the company of an alien being known as the mock turtle the oracle is believed to be a political renegade and an enemy of the democracy the oracle is believed to possess the power of precognition if the supposition that she is penelope bailey is true then the oracle is known to possess the power of precognition the oracle is believed to have resided on alpha crepello iii for between twelve and fourteen years the oracle is not believed to be a member of the government of alpha crepello iii but is believed to have considerable influence over its decisions the injun waited to make sure the computer was through then spoke again does the oracle reside in quichancha i have insufficient data to answer that question the injun paused for a moment considering his next question does the oracle ever grant audiences to humans no does the oracle ever grant audiences to members of alien races other than the blue devils i have insufficient data to answer that question that means you dont know of any such audiences that is correct has the oracle left hades at any time during the past twelve years i have insufficient data to answer that question all right said the injun lets assume that she came here twelve or thirteen years ago and hasnt seen a member of any race except the blue devils since then do you possess any information to the contrary that is correct are there any spaceports on hades other than the one in quichancha no the injun analyzed all the information he had been given and suddenly smiled then i know how im going to find her i wonder if the whistler is smart enough to figure it out the machine made no reply are you denied all access to the spaceport computer or just to its security functions i am denied access to all aspects of spaceport security what about shipping and receiving i do not understand the question can you access cargo manifests from the spaceports shipping docks yes provided the manifests do not include items associated with planetary security this is almost too simple said the injun what this embassy needs is more killers and less bureaucrats he smiled again computer access the manifests of all goods received in the past two weeks working accessed with the stated exceptions good now go through them and access a list of all human foodstuffs that have been imported from hades moons working accessed now eliminate all those items that were ordered by the embassy or the four hotels that cater to humans working eliminated now elimunate all those items that were ordered by the three restaurants in quichancha working eliminated how many items remain asked the injun four were all four items in the same shipment no they were in two shipments spaced ten days apart to whom were they consigned to vrief domo answered the computer who or what is vrief domo a native of alpha crepello iii a blue devil that is correct i knew she couldnt make a steady diet of that goddamned native meat exclaimed the injun triumphantly computer can you show me what vrief domo looks like yes silence then do so damn it said the injun a holograph of a blue devil replaced that of chandler shit muttered the injun they all look alike to me he paused what data do you possess on him vrief domo is employed by the government of alpha crepello iii the planetary government not the government of quichancha interrupted the injun that is correct what are his duties unknown where is his place of business the house of rule the house of rule repeated the injun frowning whats that the house of rule is the complex of buildings from which alpha crepello iii is governed the injun considered this then shook his head its got to be crawling with security he paused you must know something else about him give me everything you have once every ten days vrief domo accepts a shipment of human foodstuffs at the quichancha spaceport that is the only information i possess about him where does he take it working there was a lengthy silence unknown do you know where he lives no can you find out where he lives working yes is his residence in quichancha yes whats the address quichancha has no addresses in human terms can you pinpoint his residence on a map of the city yes the injun waited patiently then so do goddammit the holograph of vrief domo was replaced by a threedimensional grid of the city with a tiny flashing dot pinpointing the blue devils living quarters i want a hard copy of this working done and i also want a hard copy of vrief domos holograph a twodimensional representation is acceptable working done where are they asked the injun my printer is in the large righthand drawer of your desk you will find the hard copies there how far is the embassy from vrief domos quarters approximately meters approximately meters to be exact is that in a straight line or following the streets a straight line how far is it via the streets the shortest route is approximately kilometers very good computer make sure no one can access what weve just discussed you have already placed all your interactions with me under a priority restriction i was just reminding you i am incapable of forgetting fine deactivate the computer went dead and the injun got to his feet and walked over to the desk he opened the righthand drawer and pulled out his two hard copies he carefully folded the map and put it into a pocket of his tunic then held up the picture of vrief domo his first tangible link to the oracle gotcha you son of a bitch he said if his head hadnt begun throbbing again he might even have felt sorry for the blue devil the injun waited for two days by that time the pain had subsided and he had made discreet inquiries to make sure that his five million credits was in the pipeline was still tracing it of course but the injun was confident that it would become more and more difficult with every transaction until it was finally impossible he had the computer match the handful of incoming humans against the embassys list of anticipated arrivals and wasnt surprised when they checked out if the whistler was half as good as he was supposed to be it was going to take more than an embassy computer to find him finally when he felt well enough he summoned broussard to his quarters how are you today sir asked the young man entering the room a moment later much better im glad to hear it really asked the injun with a smile if i were you id be heartbroken to hear it im about to cut into your time with your doctor this is my job sir well its time for me to get to work on my job pull up a chair broussard walked to a corner of the room picked up a chair and carried it over to the bed now sit down and get comfortable said the injun broussard sat on the chair and grinned wryly well the sitting part is easy sir who the hell furnished this place you wouldnt think something this dull would also be uncomfortable ive often wondered that myself sir admitted broussard the indian looked amused and then his face became serious so much for small talk weve got more important things to discuss the oracle suggested broussard yes before we speak further perhaps we should go to a secure room not necessary said the injun i ordered the computer to let me know the instant anyone attempts to monitor us he tossed the map to broussard take a look at this and see if it makes any sense to you broussard studied the map carefully for a moment then looked up i take it that you want to reach the location thats been highlighted right on foot or by vehicle im not sure yet said the injun by day or at night it makes no difference yes it does sir oh why because the current temperature is fiftyseven degrees celsius and theres no way you can walk there and back without dehydrating and probably suffering heatstroke answered broussard you may be feeling better but its still only been two days since you underwent major surgery what will the temperature be tonight asked the injun perhaps fortyfour degrees celsius which is still formidable answered broussard the injun grimaced then i guess we drive he paused too damned bad your vehicle is pretty easy to identify thats an area inhabited almost exclusively by blue devils said broussard a human walking through it would be even more conspicuous have you got a safe house anywhere around there i dont think so we can ask the computer the injun shook his head dont bother he said i already asked the computer s not aware of any i just thought there might be things that you didnt tell it broussard looked puzzled any computer that can be built can be breached explained the injun not this one sir i admire your confidence said the injun dryly but ive got half a dozen friends who could invade it in less than two hours i sincerely doubt that sir replied broussard firmly im sure you do said the injun unimpressed im not here to argue the point i just want to know if theres a nearby safe house to the best of my knowledge we dont have one in quichancha i believe we have four on the entire planet all in other cities broussard fidgeted uneasily may i ask why you want to know there is every possibility that i am going to have to do some very unpleasant things to a blue devil answered the injun id rather not have to do them in a building thats filled with other blue devils id much rather take him to a secure location first is murder a possibility if he doesnt tell me what i want to know its an absolute certainty said the injun he paused thoughtfully it probably will be anyway i dont want him reporting what i know or identifying me to the oracle and i dont want him around when the whistler shows up the whistler whos that im afraid thats restricted information broussard frowned you could cause some problems for the embassy sir if you kill a blue deviland i assume this one is in some way connected to the oracle theyre going to assume the embassy ordered it or at least sanctioned it embassies exist to confront problems replied the injun with no show of concern theyll find a way i dont know sir said broussard doubtfully it would be extremely difficult to convince the blue devils that we didnt at least have prior knowledge of the killing and that implies either consent or approval he paused after all i drive an embassy vehicle and as you pointed out before it will stand out in a residential area so get an unmarked vehicle id have to put through a request for funds and even if my request was approved theres still every likelihood that it could be traced to the embassy i dont mean to sound insensitive said the injun but i really dont give a damn how much trouble i cause the embassy my assignment is more important you dont understand sir said broussard even if i agreed with you thats all the more reason for not involving the embassy it will simply put the oracle on the alert just killing the blue devil will do that said the injun suddenly a plan began to take shape in his mind unless he fell silent for a moment and broussard waited patiently for him to continue i think ive got a way to protect both our asses he announced at last yours and mine sir asked broussard puzzled the injun shook his head mine and the embassys can you get your hands on some seed seed sir alphanella seeds theyre illegal on every planet in the democracy allow me to point out to you that were not in the democracy theyre illegal on hades too you havent answered my question noted the injun can you get some seed its possible said broussard reluctantly within the embassy broussard shook his head no but theres a woman in red house user or seller a user good said the injun confiscate half a dozen seeds whats the purpose of this sir asked broussard whether they trace the killing to the embassy or not theyre going to know im after the oracle the second i kill the blue devil what have the seeds got to do with anything persisted broussard if i take out most of the residents of the building and leave a couple of halfchewed seeds on the premises the embassy could claim that i was a hoppedup chewer whod gone on a binge and offer a reward for me giving out a phony id and hologram which will get them off the hook while still giving me freedom of movement and in the meantime it might hide my real reason for being there at least temporarily he paused id have to do it at night and id have to go there on foot it wouldnt do to have an embassy vehicle being seen transporting a maniac to the scene of the crime the injun frowned ill still need your help though i cant read or speak the language and ive got to hit my blue devils quarters first before i kill the rest of them i dont want him escaping if he hears any noise elsewhere in the building broussard considered what he had heard for a long moment then shook his head no chance sir he said at last the embassy will never be a party to this youre speaking about blithely killing dozens of innocent beings simply for the sake of misdirecting the oracle the injun shrugged theyre just aliens the ambassador would point out that on this planet were the aliens spare me his platitudes said the injun the democracys at war with the oracle and in a war sometimes civilians get hurt i dont know anything about the oracle admitted broussard but i do know that the democracys not atwar with hades and your proposed actions could precipitate one he paused i know the way the bureaucracy works theyll kick it all the way up to deluros viii and even if their transmissions arent intercepted your blue devil will probably have died of old age or disease before they make a decision well thats that said the injun i cant do it without the embassys complicity i might get my hands on the seed and i might find the blue devil im after and i might kill enough other blue devils to confuse the oraclebut if the embassy wont support the cover story ill have both sides hunting for my scalp with no place to hide he sighed deeply i guess we go to plan b just killing the one blue devil asked broussard yeah said the injun he frowned i hate to do it though once hes dead theres no way the oracle can mistake whats going on he paused considering the situation and if he doesnt talk he added im going to eliminate my only link to the oracle he shook his head unhappily i just wish they didnt all look so much alike if you could follow him would you prefer it sir asked broussard much the injun looked at broussard why what do you have in mind there may be a way sir yeah said the injun if you can come up with one youve just made my life a hell of a lot easier i dont think so sir said broussard seriously port marrakech port samarkand and port maracaibo were all high in the night sky as the injun emerged from the unlit landcar half a mile from his destination this is as close as i can go without attracting attention sir said broussard apologetically ill wait here for you the injun nodded absently and tried to get his bearings the suddenly broadening suddenly narrowing always twisting streets looked a lot different in person than they did on a map and he already felt mildly disoriented he had a small lithiumpowered flashlight in the pocket of his tunic and his first inclination was to pull out the map and doublecheck his position but men with maps werent supposed to be here and the light would only broadcast his presence he had wanted to approach his destination via alleyways but there werent any his next notion was to go underground and make his way via the sewer system but they had no map of it and he didnt relish trying to find his way with no maps and no landmarks so keeping as near to the irregular buildings as he could he began walking slowly and silently through the incredibly hot night the humidity was minimal but between the heat the effort he was expending and the tension both his skin and clothes were soaked with perspiration before he had traveled more than one hundred yards he was fast approaching a very sharp corner and suddenly he could hear voices alien voicessomewhere up ahead of him he turned and looked for the landcar but it was lost in the shadows the voices grew clearer and louder until he estimated that they were no more than thirty yards from the corner he decided to duck into the doorway of the nearest building until they passed then discovered that it didnt have a doorway he backtracked a few steps found a small alcove between that building and the one he had just passed and darted into it then he crouched down and waited five blue devils suddenly came into view as they turned the corner one of them had an extremely highpitched voice but he couldnt discern any other difference among them four of them wore the triangles he had seen on his first day in quichancha and all five wore what appeared to be stoles made of some metallic fiber wrapped about their torsos as they reached a spot in the street opposite his hiding place two of them got into what seemed to be an argument and suddenly all five stopped walking voices grew strident postures grew aggressive and they remained where they were gesticulating wildly the injun felt his calves and thighs cramping up after a few minutes he was horribly uncomfortable his legs aching his body pouring sweat but he didnt dare move while the aliens were there it would be bad enough to be seen walking through this section of the city but to be found skulking would be infinitely worse finally he could stand the pain no longer and he carefully leaned forward momentarily assuming the position of a runner in the starting blocks alternately stretching each leg out behind him when he was through he carefully brought one leg beneath him and moved to a kneeling position the blue devils were still arguing but a moment later one of them made a gesture that the injun couldnt comprehend and two of them stalked off into the darkness the remaining three spoke among themselves for another minute and then continued walking in the direction they had been going the injun waited for almost three minutes long enough to make sure that none of them were coming back and then carefully stood erect stuck his head out looked in both directions and quickly walked to the corner as the map had shown the street made a degree turn almost doubling back on itself and simultaneously narrowed to a point where it was less than ten feet wide the injun felt very claustrophobic as he kept walking and the street kept narrowing within another fifty yards he had to walk sideways with his back pressed against a wall to pass between buildings on the opposite sides of the alien street then it broadened again not slowly and gradually but instantly and in a single stride he went from a street so narrow that it seemed like a corridor to a thoroughfare so wide that he thought for a moment that he had turned the wrong way and wound up in a public square there was no artificial illumination nor with the three moons overhead was any needed it was almose bright enough to read by the moonlight and he realized that he had almost three hundred yards to walk before the street narrowed again three hundred yards in which there were no parked vehicles no lampposts no benches no trash atomizers nothing to hide behind and he would be the only living moving thing he didnt like the odds of crossing those three hundred yards without being seen and he stopped looking for some less exposed route his first thought was to go via the rooftops but very few of the buildings were remotely similar in height and structure the sewers were out too even if he had a map which he didnt he couldnt spot a manhole and didnt know how to go about finding an entrance to them finally he decided that there was no alternative to simply walking as quickly and silently as he could and this he proceeded to do staying as close to the buildings on the left side of the street as possible when he had covered slightly more than half the distance he saw a blue devil staring at him from a third or fourthstory window fighting the urge to run he looked up saluted and continued walking he expected to hear outraged screams or sirens or approaching footsteps or something but nothing happened and in another ninety seconds he had turned another corner and found himself on a street that for a change seemed neither too wide nor too narrow he stepped into some deep shadows as two more blue devils came into view and was prepared to wait motionless until they had passed him but instead they entered a small building and he began walking again then another pair of blue devils began approaching and he once again hid in the shadows until they had walked by for some reason this stretch of the street had much more activity than he had encountered thus far but fortunately the buildings and shadows afforded him instant hiding places four more groups of blue devils and one single being caused him to duck out of sight before he made it the final two hundred yards to his destination but eventually he arrived at the building he sought and couldnt find a door whispering a curse to himself he began circling the structure looking for some means of ingress he finally came upon a miscolored section and leaned tentatively against it nothing happened he pushed harder with no results finally he stood back a few feet and waved a hand hoping that some hidden scanner might react to the motion still nothing he walked once more around the building and came back to the miscolored section convinced that it was the entrance he stood a few feet away from it trying to determine how to trigger the locking mechanism obviously it didnt react to force or to motion he chanced shining his flashlight on it for a second just long enough to make sure that there were no buttons buzzer bells or computer locks next he looked around the ground hoping he might find some mechanism there but he couldnt see anything remotely promising vrief domo lived on the third level he looked up wondering if he could scale the building and decided that he couldnt he spent another five minutes trying to figure out how to gain entrance to the building and couldnt come up with an answer at last he leaned against a wall next to the miscolored portion mentally exhausted and almost fell over backward when a fourfootwide section of the wall slid behind the miscolored part of the building he looked around quickly before the wall slid back and plunged the interior of the building into total darkness and found a narrow staircase he shone his light on it just long enough to fix the height of each stair in his mind and then slowly carefully began ascending fourteen stairs later he reached a landing felt around for the railing couldnt find one flashed his light again for an instant and discovered that the stairwell ended on the second level deciding that he hated alien buildings even more than he hated he stood still and tried to reason things out as far as he could determine there was only one door to the building the one he had inadvertently triggered if that was so this was the only set of stairs leading up from the ground floor therefore everyone living on a higher level had to come to this point before proceeding then what did they do he activated his flashlight again and examined the landing more carefully there were four doors each more familiar in shape than the one downstairs three of them possessed various markings the fourth was absolutely plain realizing that it was just as likely that there was only one apartment on this level and three stairwells leading up he nonetheless decided to try the unmarked door it slid up as he approached it revealing another narrow staircase and he decided to keep his light on after all if someone was coming down while he was going up having his light in his pocket wasnt going to keep his presence secret for very long anyway when he reached the next landing he was annoyed but not surprised to find that it took thirtyone stairs to reach it he came to five doors four marked and one plain now he pulled out the map once more turned it over and looked at the symbols broussard had drawn on the back the teardrop signified the domicile of a communal or family group of young blue devils old enough to leave home but still bound together by some social custom that was beyond the comprehension of human psychologists that eliminated the door on the left vrief domo was a mature blue devil with a responsible position in the government he shone his light on the next door there were seven symbols he didnt understand and one that broussard had duplicated it looked like a broken dagger or perhaps a very twisted cane broussard hadnt explained it but had said that it was the most common symbol and that for reasons that were too esoteric to go into it wouldnt be on the door he wanted that left the two righthand doors each possessed the symbol that looked like a crescent moon the one that broussard said would signify a government employee the injun was barely able to resist the urge to curse two government employees how the hell was he going to know which was the one he wanted they looked alike sounded alike dressed alike and if he chose the wrong one hed waste so much time before he discovered his error that the whistler could wind up so far ahead of him that hed never catch up think redskin he told himself silently think he studied both sets of symbols trying to find something anything that matched the other symbols broussard had said might be on vrief domos door there werent any all right he decided lets try it the other way around he had a list of eleven symbols that would definitely not be on the door of the blue devil he wanted he couldnt find any of them on the second door from the right he turned his light on the righthand door carefully studying each symbol and then he found it the offbalance trapezoid with two right angles that denoted a member of the military both blue devils worked for the government but vrief domo was a civil servant the injun turned his attention to the second door from the right vrief domos door he had been prepared to spend hours decoding a computer lock but instead all he found was a large keyhole so large that he could insert his finger all the way through it it took him less than thirty seconds to spring the latch and then he was inside the blue devils quarters his body tensed listening for any sign that his quarry might be awake he remained absolutely still for almost a minute moonlight filtered in through the single window and his right eye gradually adjusted to the semidarkness he hadnt wanted to remove the eyepatch from his prosthetic left eye hadnt wanted to have any idea of what he was doing but he needed his depth perception and he took the patch off and put it into a pocket he took a tentative step into the room then another searching for the object he sought he carefully examined the furniture both the functional pieces and the totally incomprehensible ones but he couldnt find it there were three doorways leading from the room in addition to the one through which he had entered the smell of spoiling meat wafted out from the doorway on his right and he knew that it must be the kitchen he quickly walked to it considered using his flashlight once he determined that the room was empty and then decided that hed have too much difficulty readjusting to the darkness once he left the room the kitchen was small filled with gadgets that he had never seen before and arranged in a way that made no sense whatsoever a slab of meat lay on a counter that had been constructed no more than eighteen inches above the floor chairs faced the walls spices were piled on the floor in a corner there was what seemed to be a sink with seven spigots and there was nothing that remotely seemed to resemble a stove or a refrigerator a large hectagonal chart was tacked on the wall at an odd angle he studied it for a moment but couldnt begin to guess whether it was a calendar a recipe or something else finally he returned to the room that he had originally entered and tried to figure out which of the other two doorways led to the sleeping vrief domo he paused undecided for almost a minute then he heard a gurgle of water running through a pipe off to his left and immediately walked through the lefthand doorway he found himself in a large room and this time he had no choice but to use his flashlight as there were no windows and the room was set at such an angle that none of the moonlight from the first room reached it now that he could see clearly he took the eyepatch out of his pocket and put it back over his left eye to prevent from monitoring his actions the walls were made of a beautiful alien hardwood that was streaked with various shades of brown and gold and had intricate designs carved on each panel the floor was covered by a handwoven carpet at first he thought the fabric was metallic but then he realized that it was a finely spun silk there was a strong smell of chemicals in the air and there were four large handpainted ceramic basins each with drains at the bottom and goldplated pipes running into the walls he couldnt tell which constituted a sink which was a commode and which served as a tub and he had absolutely no idea what the fourth basin was for but there was no question in his mind that he was in a blue devil bathroom there were six fixtures on the walls none of which seemed at all functional to him all of which glistened with a plating that seemed like a dull chrome but on closer inspection proved to be a handrubbed alloy not unlike pewter you guys take your ablutions seriously ill give you that he thought wryly there was a series of small porcelain boxes stacked against one of the walls and he knelt down placed the flashlight in his teeth and began opening them one by one he found what he was looking for in the third box a large triangle the same type that he had seen so many of the blue devils wearing in the street he reached into another pocket and pulled out the small vial that broussard had supplied him opened it and using a clean cloth that had been supplied for this purpose moistened it and then carefully rubbed it on the surface of the triangle he waited a moment until it dried then replaced the triangle in the box put the other two boxes back the way he had found them walked to the doorway and shut off the flashlight he waited almost two full minutes for his eyes to adjust to the filtered moonlight then enormously relieved that he wouldnt have to enter the sleeping blue devils bedroom carefully walked across the main room of the apartment and gently opened the door pulling it shut behind him he reached into the enormous keyhole and manipulated the lock back into place he had no difficulty finding his way back to ground level and a moment later he was in the street darting from shadow to shadow hugging the wall as he reached the incredibly broad section and then carefully squeezing between buildings as the street narrowed to less than a meter broussard was waiting for him and he entered the vehicle with an enormous feeling of relief you did it asked broussard yeah replied the injun youd just better be right about it i am answered broussard confidently there were microscopic particles of a unique uranium isotope in that solution some of them have to have stuck to his triangle the radiation wont do him any lasting damage but with the equipment weve got back at the embassy well be able to trace him anywhere he goes he paused well just wait for him to pick up his next shipment of human foodstuffs at the spaceport and then follow him right to the oracle sounds good to me said the injun now lets get the hell out of here right said broussard speeding off down a crazily twisting street take it easy cautioned the injun i didnt risk my life back there to die in a goddamned traffic accident im sorry sir i guess im a little excited broussard paused i would think youd be running on pure adrenaline right about now this was just the first step the next one might be a little more difficult following the blue devil no problem at all sir the problem comes when were all through following him said the injun and suddenly his feelings of triumph and exultation faded away as he wondered exactly what he would do once he found himself in the presence of the oracle parlor tricks like the one he had pulled off tonight certainly wouldnt fool her and he realized that it was time to begin considering exactly what would let him get close enough to her to accomplish his mission then as he relaxed and felt the tension finally leave his muscles an old craving returned and with it the germ of a plan the injun staked out the cargo area of the spaceport for four days with no success on the fifth morning vrief domo finally showed up hes here sir announced broussard pointing to a blinking indicator on the control panel grid damned near time said the injun leaning forward from the landcars backseat to look at the blinking light i was starting to think the oracle had gone on a hunger strike hes approaching the cargo dock how long will it take us to find out what hes picked up were tied into the embassy computer and it in turn is monitoring the spaceports cargo manifests i think we should have corroboration before he leaves the gate just be ready to move out fast said the injun broussard nodded without replying and concentrated on the panel okay he announced after another two minutes he s made his pickup and hes on his way out follow him the embassy computer hasnt verified that hes picked up foodstuffs yet he could be carrying almost anything follow him anyway ordered the injun if he leaves the spaceport theres no need for us to stay here and if hes got food for the oracle i dont want to lose him he paused let him get a kilometer ahead of us i dont dare sir said broussard the way these streets wind that could give him a tenminute lead so what if the oracles not in the city and he leaves quichancha ten minutes before we do he could get so far ahead of us that we lose his signal all right said the injun but stay far enough behind so he doesnt spot us if he thinks hes being followed he could lead us all over the goddamned planet or right into a trap ill do my best sir said broussard moving the car into the heavy spaceport traffic and keeping a watchful eye on his panel another light blinked the computer just confirmed it announced broussard excitedly he picked up human food at the cargo dock the injun made no comment and broussard began concentrating on his panel making certain that he didnt lose vrief domos vehicle on the small grid the blue devil didnt seem to be in much of a hurry he passed through a residential area then turned to the south he s going to see her right now said the injun as the city came to a surprisingly abrupt end and they suddenly found themselves in the vast expanse of red desert that had given the planet its name he could be going almost anywhere responded broussard concentrating on the narrow road that seemed so out of place on the red sand the injun shook his head hes going to see her he repeated how do you know we know she doesnt live in the city and we know that hes transporting food to her the injun paused i hope youve got more fuel than he does id hate to think of losing him out here and even more i hate to think of roasting to death in this goddamned landcar it must be sixty degrees celsius outside its not a problem sir answered broussard this vehicle has an auxiliary power plant that utilizes solar batteries the one place we wont get stranded is the desert hes not going to stay in the desert for long oh said broussard dubiously if he was headed to the next city it would have been more practical to ship the food via public transportation his destination is somewhere up ahead not too far awayand it wont be in the desert because any structure that was built here would stand out like a sore thumb he pointed to some large rock outcroppings about sixteen kilometers to the southeast my guess is that hes heading there it makes sense when you say it that way sir admitted broussard but but you think its too pat well frankly yes the injun smiled the simpler something is the less can go wrong with it that applies equally to machines and hideouts broussard shrugged youre the expert the injun leaned forward again checked the blinking light on the grid then laid a hand gently on broussards shoulder come to a stop but well lose him hes already eight or nine miles ahead of us believe me hes going to stop at those rocks up ahead said the injun but were starting to raise a cloud of dust from all the sand thats blown onto the road and i dont want him to see it all right said broussard reluctantly slowing the vehicle to a dead stop pull off the road broussard shook his head i dont dare sir well sink into the sand its that soft and that deep i wonder how they ever managed to keep the road itself from sinking asked the injun curious beats the hell out of me sir broussard pulled out a pair of small antarrean cigars and offered one to the injun care for a smoke sir filthy habit would you rather i didnt smoke asked broussard the injun shrugged suit yourself i figure everyones allowed at least one weakness broussard stared at the cigars for a long moment then sighed and replaced them in his tunic how long do you intend to remain here sir how far ahead of us is he now broussard checked the grid about twelve kilometers i suppose we might as well get going again said the injun as the last of the dust cloud dissipated if we start raising too much dust stop even if we lose him on the screen well catch up with him at the rocks up ahead the vehicle began moving forward and when they were within six kilometers of the rocky outcroppings broussard announced that vrief domos vehicle had stopped its somewhere in that field of rocks as you said sir theres gotta be some buildings hidden in there said the injun is that grid of yours good enough to tell us which one he enters no problem answered broussard i can pinpoint his location whenever you want the injun considered this then shook his head not good enough if this is her headquarters there could be half a dozen structures and domo could have business in three or four of them i need to know where he drops off the food he paused does the road run through the rocks or around them around them can you tell if theres more than one building in the rocks to be honest sir i didnt know there were any buildings there the injun sighed too bad i guess we do it the hard way the hard way get me as close to the rocks as you can and let me off ive got to find out if theres more than one building and if there is i have to figure out which one the oracle is in that wont be as hard as you think sir said broussard the grid detaches from the control panel you can take it with you im going to carry that thing over uneven terrain in this unholy heat without being spotted by the bestprotected person on the planet and you dont think itll be hard said the injun wryly i merely meant that never mind never mind said the injun just get me to the edge of the rocks its about three kilometers from one end to the other said broussard as they approached the outcroppings then the desert starts again shall i wait for you here or on the far side right here i dont think weve been spotted yet why take any chances actually sir said broussard thoughtfully i suppose it doesnt really matter where i wait for you if the oracles got the gift of precognition as most members of the embassy seem to believe then she knows youre here to terminate her no she doesnt said the injun confidently broussard frowned but she cant foresee what was never going to happen and i have no intention of confronting her today i just want to know where to find her he stared at broussard you look unconvinced whether you confront her today or tomorrow or next week the end result is the same you mean to do her harm at some point in the future so why wouldnt she dispose of you right now before you can threaten her there has to be a limit to her powers answered the injun the fact that im still alive means were still beyond it she might simply be waiting for you to approach on foot suggested broussard she might be agreed the injun but i dont think so if planning to kill her was enough to elicit a response from her she could have killed me or had me killed half a dozen times since i landed i have a feeling that she either cant foresee anything but an immediate physical threat to her or else shes so secure in her powers that shes not concerned until shes threatened either way he concluded with a wry smile ive got to find out exactly where she is before i can threaten her how do you even approach someone who can see the future the injun smiled when the time comes youll be the first to know you seem awfully sure of yourself sir said broussard this is my business and im damned good at it the injun glanced out the window start slowing down then stop behind that big rock thats coming up on the right broussard did as he was instructed good said the injun detaching the grid opening the door and wincing as he stepped out into the oppressive heat he took few tentative steps along the side of the road then turned back to broussard the grounds a lot harder here pull off the road and move alongside the rock if anyone else comes along theyll pass right by and never know you were here broussard nodded and edged the vehicle off the road and the injun began climbing to the top of a rocky outcropping he couldnt see anything out of the ordinary but he checked the grid and found that domos position had not changed appreciably in the past few minutes which implied there had to be something hidden back there among the rocks and boulders he had gone almost half a mile keeping well off the road and hiding among the myriad outcroppings when he finally saw the first building it resembled nothing more than a purple glass pyramid some twenty feet on a side and he was more annoyed than surprised to note that it possessed neither windows nor a discernible door he looked at the grid again and found that he was still half a mile away from vrief domo he continued his slow cautious approach and finally he came to it he didnt have to check the grid or search for domos vehicle to know he had reached his goal nestled in a small depression beneath a huge outcropping was a building palace would have described it better as would fortress except that both words seemed somehow inadequate that covered the equivalent of a quichancha city block the structure was irregular and manysided walls rose to enormous heights and then angled back down for no apparent reason the roof was a hodgepodge of colored quartz and a shining metal that seemed to shimmer with all the colors of the spectrum a private road covered by some incredibly hard plastic that showed no sign of melting in the heat led up to a huge triangular door that he assumed was a garage for numerous vehicles here and there were artifacts that looked like fountains but none of them seemed to have any water and he had no idea what function they fulfilled the building was beautifully camouflaged between the rocks and the depression there was no way to spot it from overhead and a huge row of boulders had been positioned in such a way as to shield it from the view of passing vehicles only in one location could a driver turn off the road and slip his landcar between two of the boulders and then onto the plastic surface half a dozen blue devils were walking in intricate individual patterns around the grounds they didnt seem to be carrying any weapons and the injun couldnt tell if they were guards residents of the huge building or were simply carrying out some duty so alien that he couldnt begin to comprehend it the grid was going wild and afraid that it might start beeping as well as blinking he quickly deactivated it he was still wearing his eyepatch he wanted very badly to remove it to get a more thorough view of the building and its surroundings but he was afraid that would record the image and bring in some expert to identify the rock formations at this particular point and he hadnt gone to all the trouble of finding the oracles hideout just to broadcast it to and his whole department he squatted down in the shadow of a large overhang and spent the next ten minutes studying the layout and taking holographs with the tiny camera he had brought along for the purpose when he finally felt himself beginning to dehydrate from the heat he carefully retreated still staying well clear of the road until he came to the spot where broussard had hidden the vehicle god its hot out there he panted leaning back and luxuriating in the conditioned air of the vehicle people werent built to live in this kind of heat agreed broussard sometimes i think even the blue devils look uncomfortable in this weather he paused did you find her i think so you think so repeated broussard i didnt see her answered the injun but ill be awfully surprised if shes not there did you find a way in im working on it what now the injun leaned back comfortably clasped his hands behind his head and shut his eyes now we go back to quichancha and wait wait for what asked broussard for any number of things said the injun serenely for certain funds to be transferred for the whistler to show up for the oracle to make another mistake another mistake the injun nodded she should have killed me this afternoon i was unarmed and on foot and i couldnt have run fifty yards in that heat he paused she has her limitations she cant see far enough ahead to know that the next time i come back im going to kill her i still dont see how you plan to do it sir said broussard putting the vehicle in motion and starting to head back toward quichancha the injun smiled tranquilly neither does she but you do have a plan absolutely would you care to share it with me youll know it when the time comes answered the injun if i know it wont the oracle know it too very likely then shell be able to prevent it the injun shook his head knowing it wont do her the least bit of good i dont understand sir said broussard neither will she said the injun smiling again i almost feel sorry for her part the jade queens book chandler remained in his rooming house for three days following the attempts on his life leaving only to have dinner each night at the wolfmans restaurant he considered meeting with some of the surgeons former clientele and going through the motions of soliciting business but decided against it after all both the oracle and the democracy had tried to kill him there didn t seem to be any reason to try to maintain his cover on the fourth night as he entered the restaurant accompanied by gin who had resumed his duties though his injured shoulder was still heavily bandaged the wolfman spotted him and immediately approached him follow me please he said leading them to a small circular room at the back of the restaurant where lord lucifer sat at a hexagonal table good evening mr chandler said lord lucifer good evening replied chandler looking around the room as gin seated himself at the table finally he took a small device out of his pocket and pressed it against a wall where it remained when he took his hand away whats that asked the wolfman an antieavesdropping device answered chandler itll scramble any signals that might leave this room youre a very careful man mr chandler said lord lucifer thats how i stay alive can i bring you anything whistler asked the wolfman i just got in a shipment of cygnian cognac later dinner perhaps well let you know the wolfman shrugged and went back into the restaurant whilechandler seated himself at the table well said chandler facing the dapper criminal finding a way to smuggle you onto hades is proving to be more difficult than i thought replied lord lucifer since bomas death the blue devils have taken additional security measures on their shuttle flights it can be done of course but it will take a lot more time and planning than i had anticipated he paused and smiled shes definitely not very anxious to see you in the flesh mr chandler if shes everything shes supposed to be i dont imagine shes losing any sleep over the prospect replied chandler this is probably the blue devils idea he stopped speaking struck by a sudden thought what is it mr chandler asked lord lucifer staring at him intently consider what i just said answered chandler theres no reason why a woman who can foresee the future should be worried about me trying to kill her therefore this has to be the blue devils idea he stared at lord lucifer what does that imply to you that they dont want you to reach her of course they dont said chandler impatiently but why not they know the extent of her power its whats kept them out of the democracy so why should this worry them i see said lord lucifer suddenly grinning well i dont see a damned thing interjected gin would someone please tell me what you two think you know chandler turned to the driver ive been hired to bring her out and to kill her only as a last resort i havent figured out how to kill her yet and they have no reason to think she can be killed what does that imply to you gin shrugged i dont know he said confused what should it imply that theyre afraid shell leave voluntarily with mr chandler said lord lucifer ive been operating on the assumption that shes remained on hades by choice added chandler but what if that assumption was false youve told me about her said gin how could they hold someone with her powers against her will you lock her in an electrified cell surround it with a force field and leave two guards on duty and all the foresight in the world isnt going to do her a bit of good said chandler if every possible future has her incarcerated against her will then thats where shell stay it still doesnt make sense protested gin if she can see the future why would she let herself be locked up to begin with chandler shrugged who knows she was only eight years old when she came to hades maybe her powers werent that well developed then she arrived with an alien called the mock turtle maybe he betrayed her maybe she simply didnt understand what they intended to do with her he paused or maybe they were all bosom buddies until the day she decided to leave and they realized that without her they were going to be assimilated into the democracy or maybe youre dead wrong said gin unconvinced maybe said chandler but lets assume for the sake of argument that im right he paused again it would also explain why the democracy wants me dead if they think there s a chance shell come out with me theyll just have to go to the trouble of tracking her down again and i gather she wasnt an easy lady to find he paused look at it from their point of view the blue devils arent much of a military threat and they havent made any major alliances with the democracys enemies if they cant kill her this is probably as safe a place to keep her as any if she leaves she could go to the canphor twins or lodin xi or some other world that can make war on the democracy i still think youre making a mistake said gin adamantly prove it easy said the driver if she wants you to rescue her why did she send the blue devil to kill you she didnt that was his idea his or his governments then how did he know who you were and where to find you a very good point said lord lucifer he turned to chandler have you an answer there are no answers when were dealing with such minimal information just suppositions said chandler but suppose she could foresee that boma couldnt kill me that id spot the glass in the foodand suppose further that she knew it would lead me to the very conclusion ive just reached he paused wouldnt that be the best way she had of telling me that she was willing to leave that s a lot of supposing said gin dubiously i sure wouldnt risk my life on it i dont plan to risk my life on it either answered chandler not yet anyway he fell silent for a moment collecting his thoughts still ive got a gut feeling that im right i think a new course of action is called for what did you have in mind mr chandler asked lord lucifer well we seem to be in agreement that i cant go to hades right now not if theyre searching every shuttle then what do you plan to do i would think the answer was obvious answered chandler if i cant go in after her the only alternative is to get her to come to me shell never come up here said lord lucifer if she wants to leave with you the blue devils will never let her and if youre wrong and she wants you dead shes got enough agents on port marrakech to do the job for her i have no intention of remaining on port marrakech said chandler the blue devils know who i am and the democracy is also trying to kill me then i still dont understand what youre going to do said lord lucifer frowning there are two other moons which one has the most blue devils on it port maracaibo offered gin port samarkand is mostly farms and processing plants then the whistler is going to be captured by that famed opportunist lord lucifer who will incarcerate him in the tunnels beneath the platinum quarter until someone pays a ransom of oh not to price myself too cheaply ten million credits chandler smiled no one will pay it of course the democracy wants me out of the way the blue devils want me out of the way and the iceman isnt about to dip into his own pocket to rescue me he paused and tomorrow a man with a fresh and totally untraceable identity will show up on port maracaibo hell dwell in total obscurity shunning the spotlight there every bit as much as the whistler sought it on port marrakech and before a month has gone by hell have wrought such havoc among the oracles agents that the blue devils themselves will insist that she take a hand in finding and capturing him you really think theyll send her to port maracaibo to find you asked lord lucifer theyre not going to be willing to live in a state of terror forever replied chandler and theyre certainly not going to declare war against the moons and give the democracy any cause for moving in to protect its human population sooner or later theyre going to decide that their best bet is to send the oracle to port maracaibo to save them and if they decide shes too valuable to risk losing persisted lord lucifer then answered chandler wryly ive still got four months to think of something else i dont mean to be insulting mr chandler but thats a pretty feeble answer it was facetious admitted chandler actually if i cant draw her up to port maracaibo i think my chances of getting her out may actually be enhanced you lost me again said gin im afraid i dont quite follow you either added lord lucifer if shes totally committed to the blue devils shell come after me the instant i start putting pressure on them she probably considers herself invulnerable so from her point of view theres no risk involved its just a matter of tending to security and if she actually wants to leave hades and they let her come anyway then they feel they can control her and ive overestimated her power he paused but if theyre afraid to let her come to port maracaibo then her power is every bit as awesome as ive been led to believe it is and they dont dare risk giving her any freedom of action at all if that s the case all i have to do is figure out a way to open one door for her and shell do the rest lord lucifer smiled you make it sound a lot simpler than i think it will prove to be well if it was easy someone would have gotten to her before now admitted chandler he paused i dont know about anyone else but i think im ready for that cognac sounds good to me agreed gin chandler turned to the driver why dont you go and tell the wolfman to bring it in sure thing whistler said gin he got up from the table and left the room find out everything you can about him said chandler lowering his voice about gin repeated lord lucifer hes been around for years do it anyway do you have some reason to suspect he might be in the employ of the oracle if shes got any humans working for her im not aware of it neither am i admitted lord lucifer he frowned then why are you suspicious of him the oracle s not the only one trying to kill me remember but gin was almost killed by a democracy assassin protested lord lucifer and he spent two days in the hospital with a shoulder burn responded chandler he should have been out on the street the next morning they knew he was my driver they may have gotten to him while he was being patched up if they did i want to know who he reports to ill take care of it promised lord lucifer he paused thoughtfully still i think your fears are groundless look at him the man practically worships you if i recall my theology judas practically worshipped jesus too answered chandler wryly duly noted said lord lucifer by the way it occurs to me that you could use a contact on port maracaibo you have one in mind no doubt suggested chandler the very best answered lord lucifer but i see gin is returning with our cognac so perhaps wed best discuss it later right agreed chandler good stuff said gin entering the room with a bottle and three glasses on a tray i had a little taste out there just to make sure it was as represented he filled the glasses and passed them around let me propose a toast mr chandler be my guest to the oracle said lord lucifer she has certainly made our lives more interesting ill drink to that said chandler raising his glass to his lips lets just hope she hasnt also made them briefer there were major differences between port maracaibo and port marrakech although they had been terraformed by the same team and possessed almost identical atmospheres gravities and climates the structures on port maracaibo were less exotic more rectangular less formal more closely clustered in the residential areas the city which like its counterpart on port marrakech bore the name of the moon had been carefully planned its streets were laid out in a grid its commercial center had clearly defined borders and a series of public coaches powered by superconductivity skimmed a few inches above the streets between the city center and the outlying areas chandler sat in a coach studying a map of the city he had picked up while passing through customs from time to time he looked up to make sure that no one was watching him but he didnt seriously expect that he was being followed before leaving port marrakech he had dyed his auburn hair a dark brown put browntinted contact lenses into his eyes and had left all his weaponry on port marrakech his new features perfectly matched the passport that lord lucifer had supplied him and he hadnt set off any alarms while going through spaceport security he was just a downonhisluck traveler hoping to find work on the farthest of hades three moons his new name was preston grange and lord lucifer had even arranged to give him a history that included four arrests and a pair of convictions for minor crimes he probably couldnt stand the kind of scrutiny he would receive if he were arrested but then if he were arrested he had more pressing problems to worry about anyway the address lord luficer had given him was on cleopatra street he hunted it up on the map realized that he had to change coaches in order to reach it and walked to a door an electronic sensor picked up the heat from his body relayed it to the coachs brain and the coach came to a stop at the next corner chandler stepped out looked for a public transit sign on the next cross street and stood in front of it a moment later he was in another coach and a few minutes after that he was standing on cleopatra street he checked a number and began walking toward the address he had been given the area quickly turned shabby and a bit rundown bars nightclubs and drug dens lined the street and brightly dressed men and women lingered in doorways some beckoning some engaged in whispered conversations some merely staring out at the street in complete boredom finally he came to number a small unobtrusive building stuck between an allnight restaurant and a sleazy nightclub promising acts that would shock any race in the galaxy bar none he opened the door and found himself in a small octagonal foyer with no other doors there was a small device on one wall about five feet above the floor and a recorded slightly mechanical voice instructed him to peer into it he did as he was told and was soon staring at a hologram of a stunningly beautiful blonde woman doing a sensuous dance the hologram vanished after thirty seconds and the voice informed him that his retinagram had been taken analyzed and cleared please step forward said the voice chandler approached the wall which slid aside to let him pass through then moved back into place he followed a narrow corridor and emerged into a luxurious parlor filled with plush fumishings erotic paintings and holograms and even a bronze sculpture of the same woman who had appeared in the little holo he had seen in the foyer the room was filled with women in various states of undress including a pair who were totally nude there were four men present a huge wellmuscled bouncer and three welldressed men who were obviously clients a seductively clad woman detached herself from a group of similarly dressed young women and approached chandler welcome to the womb the finest brothel on the three moons she said may i help you im looking for the jade queen replied chandler is she expecting you i believe so and your name is he stared at her just tell her that lord lucifer sent me wont you make yourself comfortable said the woman ill be back shortly she left the room and chandler idly inspected some of the erotic artwork that hung on the walls she returned a moment later follow me please she said chandler fell into step behind her as she led him into an airlift ascended two levels walked down a narrow corridor then stopped when she came to the very last door shes in there thanks perhaps ill see you later suggested the woman i doubt it she shrugged and walked away and chandler turned to face the door he heard the whirring of a holo camera and felt the brief always slightly unpleasant sensation of having his retina scanned and then the door receded and he entered a huge octagonal chamber furnished with artwork and exotic artifacts from more than a dozen worlds the carpet rippled with a life of its own and a golden love seat designed for beings that bore no resemblance to humanity hovered inches above the ground off to his left dominating the room was a huge window that looked out upon sights far more alien and savage than the jungles of the frenchmans world chandler looked for the holo projector that was casting the incredibly real images but couldnt spot it seated behind a large desk that allowed her to observe both the door and the window was a woman no longer youthful but not quite middleaged carrying a few pounds more than she should have but carrying them well she wore a jade necklace and a pair of rings with matching stones and a golden outfit trimmed with the delicate feathers of some alien bird her eyes were large green and rather wideset her nose small and straight her lips thin and painted an iridescent orange her hair was brown but streaked with shades of gold and red carefully coiffed and piled high atop her head what can i do for you mr she said in a voice that was just a little lower and a little deeper than he had expected grange he replied preston grange that idiot she snapped contemptuously i beg your pardon hes sent three preston granges to port maracaibo in the past four years how long does he think he can keep getting away with it serves me right for trusting anyone else said chandler ill change it tomorrow just out of curiosity what is your name she asked chandler do some people call you the whistler from time to time she nodded as if to herself i thought it was you your fame precedes you mr chandler so it would appear does my alias he added wryly no problem she said youll have a new identity before you leave my office she paused then indicated a chair facing the desk have a seat he did as she bade him can i get you something to drink no thanks something to make you happier perhaps or mentally sharper he shook his head she shrugged as you wish she said walking to the cabinet and helping herself to a pair of small round pills she stood perfectly still for a moment as if waiting for the effect whatever it was to begin then sat down opposite him write down the name you want to use so that there wont be any discrepancy in the way its spelled ill need your signature for the id documents anyway have you got a piece of paper he asked withdrawing a pen from a pocket of his tunic she opened the top drawer of her desk and handed him a monogrammed sheet of stationery all right said chandler scribbling on the paper this is it she took the sheet back from him and studied it julio juan javier chandler smiled its so alliterative that no one will ever believe it s not a real name given by a doting mother with terrible taste no one would use a name like that as a cover she shrugged all right youll be javier by tomorrow morning she paused for a moment ill start calling you that right now i dont want to get in the habit of calling you chandler or whistler and having it slip out at an inopportune time and what do i call you asked chandler my professional name is the jade queen you may call me jade may i assume that you own this place jade i own every building and business for two blocks in each direction she answered bluntly im impressed said chandler you should be whats your connection to lord lucifer since he sent you here theres no sense hiding it from you she replied i suppose you could say that hes my counterpart on port marrakech each of us has created an empire by preying upon the foolish the gullible and the greedy she paused his holdings do not extend to port maracaibo and mine do not extend to port marrakech but she added each of us would like to establish a foothold on hades itself so it is in our best interest to help you in any way we can good said chandler ill take all the help i can get from what i hear youll need plenty said jade does anyone else know youre here just my driver a man named gin hes back on port marrakech under lord lucifers watchful eye have you some reason to be suspicious of him she asked no then why i just dont have a very trusting nature she nodded her approval youll live a lot longer that way she paused youre sure hes the only person other than lord lucifer who knows youre here except for you how long do you plan to stay here im not sure yet answered chandler possibly a month hopefully much less well if you want me to help you while youre on port maracaibo perhaps youd better tell me what youll be doing here you might be better off not knowing he suggested once i tell you youre legally culpable mr javier said jade i own half the officials on this moon and i rent the other half if you want my help youre going to have to tell me what you intend to do otherwise we cant do business chandler paused for a moment then nodded his acquiescence all right he replied ive come to port maracaibo to kill blue devils if you hate blue devils there were plenty of them on port marrakech i wasnt interested in killing those blue devils so i gather she said why do you want to kill these particular blue devils i hope to elicit a response i dont understand said jade what kind of response hatred fear panic all three thats no answer why is it important that the blue devils on port maracaibo should feel fear or panic because if they do i hope they will make an attempt to prevent what im doing she stared at him for a moment you think theyll summon the oracle to come to port maracaibo and hunt you down dont you thats right that may not be the brightest idea youve ever had said jade shes supposed to be virtually invulnerable how do you propose to kill her shes much more valuable alive than dead said chandler there isnt a govemment or military organization in the galaxy that wouldnt give its eyeteeth to get its hands on her after all how can you lose an election or a war when shes on your side telling you what to do next he paused the democracy has been after her for sixteen years ive been paid to bring her out and to kill her only if there is no possible way of taking her away from hades and you think that if you kill enough blue devils shell come to port maracaibo its a possibility jade looked dubious why should she because shell be the only one who can stop me and eventually the blue devils are going to get tired of being decimated what i meant was what does she care about blue devils why should she leave hades where even the fleet doesnt dare attack her because i have reason to believe that she wants to leave hades that in fact she may be incarcerated there against her will oh he explained his chain of reasoning to her as he had done to lord lucifer two days earlier so actually youll be more encouraged if she doesnt come to port maracaibo than if she does said jade if im reading the situation correctly yes how long will you give her continued jade how many blue devils will you have to kill before you decide that she isnt coming i dont know admitted chandler i imagine itll depend on how much confusion i can cause here and how much i can disrupt any lines of communication that exist between her and port maracaibo i still dont know why you had to come here to do it though my identity was known to too many people on port marrakech he answered sooner or later the blue devils would have figured out who was behind the killings and they would have come after me themselves it makes much more sense to start on a new world with a fresh identity theyre only going to use her as a last resort once they themselves have failed to find out whos responsible for the murders and the disruptions jade got up walked to a wet bar poured herself a cygnian cognac and turned to face him well you certainly have your work cut out for you julio juan javier she sipped her drink where do i come in im an outsider here answered chandler and i plan to keep it that way given a week or so i could learn my way around the city find out where the blue devils congregate and set up a number of hideouts but a lot of men and blue devils would see me and some of them might remember me and the only way to make this an effective campaign of terror is for my identity to be completely concealed in fact id be just as happy if the blue devils think im one of them therefore i need a guide someone who can tell me where to go or better still provide me with some form of private transportation and i need a place to return to when im done one of the bedrooms at the womb would serve my purposes because that way if anyone ever does track me back here youll be able to vouch that id been here all night he paused and theres another reason i need you oh im going to have to kill a number of alien beings its strictly business and i have no more use for them than they have for me but it would be less wasteful and more useful if you could direct me toward those blue devils who might be in contact with the oracle or whatever forces she controls since the object of this operation is to wreak enough havoc and cause enough disruption that the blue devils are forced to bring the oracle here to confront me then my most effective course of action is to kill those blue devils who might have some connection to her or at least to the government of hades i see said jade nodding thoughtfully by the way im going to need some weapons can you get them for me no problem chandler paused theres one more thing you should know he added oh and what is that someone in the democracy doesnt want me to fulfill my contract i dont know if they dont want me to bring her out or if they dont want me to kill her but this person or these people whichever the case may be tried to kill me back on port marrakech is the democracy your employer asked jade i think so you think so im just a subcontractor he answered ive never dealt directly with the person whos paying for this jade frowned one thing puzzles me she said returning to her chair and sitting down once more if the democracy is your employer why dont they just call you off i dont know for a fact that the democracy is my employer and at any rate im not working directly for it let me try it a different way continued jade if they dont want you to fulfill your mission why are you going ahead with it because im a businessman not a patriot answered chandler i was paid half the money up front and i dont get the other half until i complete the contract youre a foolish man said jade whatever theyre paying you it isnt worth going up against the oracle then youre an equally foolish woman for helping me replied chandler theres a difference she said theres an entire world for the taking my gain is commensurate with the risk yours isnt half a world he corrected her youre referring to lord lucifer of course chandler nodded hes out of the equation said jade her expression as cold and hard as chandlers own or did you really think you were the only killer in this room jade ushered chandler to a large luxurious room next to her own it possessed an ornate airbed handcarved furniture from the domar system and the same holographic display she had in her office ill pass the word that ive got a special friend living here and everyone will leave you alone she said wont they want to see who your special friend is asked chandler whats wrong with that she retorted the more people who know youre here the better well even have all your meals brought up here the trick is not to let anyone see you leave she paused thats a false closet she continued indicating one of four identical mirrored doors lining one of the walls ill rig it to respond to your retinagram so it will open whenever you approach it and stay open for shall we say twenty seconds behind it is an airlift that will take you down to my garage youll enter and leave the building through it and no one will know youre gone i saw a number of doors down the corridor said chandler how much business gets transacted on this floor almost none unless were overcrowded some of the girls sleep up here when theyre too tired or too busy to go home it would probably be a good idea for you to meet a few of them and try to make friends with them the more people who can vouch that you spend all your time up here the better it sounds good he replied ill need to take a tour of the city tomorrow ill be off duty just before sunrise she said well leave then she paused id better fetch you the first time until you learn your way around jade walked to the door ill see you in a few hours he offered no reply and she left the room chandler took a dryshower shaved and then lay down on the bed he was asleep almost instantly but some internal clock woke him up about twenty minutes before jade was due back and he was dressed and ready for her when she appeared you look pleased with yourself he noted as she entered the room dressed in a more practical outfit and handed him the weapons he had requested i take it the whorehouse did a good nights business actually it was only average she replied but i did a good nights business she tossed two small packets onto the bed what are these the top one contains your new id papers and passport thanks he said studying them with an expert eye that was fast youre paying for it and whats in the other one take a look he picked it up and opened it withdrawing a sheet of paper on which were written a trio of incomprehensible alien symbols what is it he asked one of the wombs clients works for the planetary defense department she replied i didnt know you had one when you live on a moon and youre outnumbered hundreds to one by a hostile population on the planet that youre orbiting youd damned well better have one she said oh we couldnt win a war with the blue devils in fact we probably couldnt last ten minutes if they attacked us but we monitor all their transmissions and if we ever have cause to believe that an attack is being planned well send for the navy she paused anyway this client specializes in translating and decoding the blue devils transmissions and that she concluded gesturing toward the paper is the way the blue devils refer to the oracle in their own language how did you get him to write this down first i got him a little drunk said jade with a smile and then i appealed to his ego which alas is the most massive thing about him by the time he wakes up in the morning he wont even remember he wrote it all right said chandler now i know how to spell the oracles name on hades so what well said jade it seems to me that if youre trying to elicit a response to use your own words you can elicit it a lot faster if youll leave this symbol on each of your victims chandler considered her suggestion not bad he admitted its damned good replied jade if they think the oracles responsible for the killings shell have to try to capture you to prove shes innocent and if they think shes being set up theyre going to want her to stop you from killing them with such impunity she flashed him a triumphant smile they might even think youre trying to elicit a response so that were justified in bringing in the fleet that ought to shake them up agreed chandler id like you to do something else for me what contact the guy who gave this to you and see if he knows which blue devil is sending those messages and also see if he can identify any other blue devils who work for the oracle or if he knows the location from which theyre being sent i think well get a much quicker response if i go after those blue devils who are in communication with her ill make a point of finding out next time hes here how often does he show up here asked chandler she shrugged it varies chandler shook his head not good enough he could stay away for weeks all right said jade ill invite him to lunch after i show you around the city will he come she smiled if i invite him hell come she paused well she said at last are you ready to go lead the way she walked to the false closet waited for it to open and led him inside a moment later they floated gently down to the basement level on the heavy air currents there were two vehicles parked there an elegant chrome and gold groundcar that like the public coaches was capable of skimming just above the ground but also possessed wheels for those streets that hadnt been treated for superconductivity and a very old very nondescript vehicle that had seen better days and even better decades but which would arouse almost no interest she entered the latter and he climbed into the front seat beside her what do you think of it she asked it belongs in a home for the elderly it might surprise you javier she replied with a smile ive had the whole thing rebuilt and customized beneath this exterior its twice as fast as the showpiece over there she continued indicating the groundcar interesting commented chandler practical answered jade it doesnt draw attention the way the other one does and as a result i can maintain my privacy when i have to go out she pulled out of the garage and drove up a ramp to the street then turned north youve got to watch out for these damned coaches she commented moving to the side of the street to allow a coach to pass her theyre omnipresent and theyre responsible for eighty percent of the accidents in the city where are we going asked chandler blue devil heaven thats what its called its what it ought to be called replied jade its the area where most of the blue devils congregate there are a few shops but no restaurants no nightclubs no whorehouses nothing but apartment buildings theyre a strange race javierive been on port maracaibo for eleven years and i still dont know what the hell theyre doing here theyre not part of the economy they dont work they dont organize politically they dont interact with men they just hang around on street corners like a bunch of surly human teenagers they must immigrate here for some reason said chandler i suppose so she agreed but ill be damned if anyone i know can tell you what it is maybe they just want some token presence here in case they ever try to reclaim the moons some legal justification to prove theyve never really relinquished them she shook her head thats a good logical human reason so its probably not valid she looked ahead here it comes she announced once we cross this big street coming up were in their neighborhood chandler looked out the window and studied the area most of the buildings had been built for human residents and had fallen into various states of disrepair blue devils lined the streets most of them simply standing and staring a few walking purposefully what do they do for entertainment asked chandler have they got anything akin to holos or theaters damned if i know i thought youd been living here for eleven years we dont bother them they dont bother us answered jade both races prefer it that way drive by the heart of their commercial district said chandler i want to take a look at it she turned left for a block then continued going north in another moment they came to a single block that was lined with shops and stores almost half of which were grocery markets go slower said chandler jade slowed the vehicles pace it wont work she said what wont destroying some grocery stores she answered theyre not like us youre just as likely to disrupt them by killing some innocuouslooking blue devil whos standing on a corner minding his own business ill do both if i have to he replied id much rather find out which blue devils have some connection to the oracle though i told you id get your information she said irritably in case its escaped your notice i havent been out of your presence since you first said you wanted it im sorry he said its just that i find the thought of killing hundreds of blue devils wasteful id rather kill two or three who matter to the oracle and get the same response a moral assassin she said with an amused smile not everyone gets into this business because they like to kill people he replied then why do you do it because i find all forms of business distasteful answered chandler this one pays me enough so that i dont have to work very often i suppose theres a twisted kind of logic to that said jade lets leave this part of the city he said after a few more minutes had passed go back to the womb and then just start driving around that general area i want to get the feel of it and to make sure i can find my way back in the dark she headed for the womb spent another twenty minutes crisscrossing the vicinity and finally pulled into the sunken garage im going to leave you here and try to get some more information said jade once you get back up to your room just tell the computer what you want to eat and it will transmit the order to our kitchen youve got a kitchen he asked surprised well actually its in the restaurant next door but the buildings are connected in the meantime ill see what i can find out about the transmissions she seemed about to open the door then paused can i ask you a question javier go ahead just what is it that makes the oracle so valuable to the democracy asked jade weve all heard of her but no one knows exactly who she is or what she does she sees the future second sight more than that if all she could do was see what was going to happen next i think everyone except gamblers and stockbrokers would leave her alone what else does she do she not only sees the future she manipulates it answered chandler she sees every possible future every permutation and she tries to make the one she wants come to pass youre kidding no im not if shes got the power to make anything happen that she can envision why hasnt she conquered the galaxy by now he shrugged its a big galaxy and i think her power has its limits what limits i dont know he admitted but if she didnt have them she would have conquered the galaxy by now or at least changed it a hell of a lot more than she has just the same said jade i hope theyre paying you enough sometimes i wonder about that myself he said getting out of the vehicle he floated up to his room ordered a meal decided that it was a good thing the brothel wasnt depending on the quality of its food to make a profit then lay back on his airbed and watched a prerecorded game of murderball on the holo jade entered the room just as the game and its few remaining participants had headed into overtime how did you do he asked getting to his feet well ive got your first victim for you she said and with a little luck i may have the oracles location by tomorrow morning oh she nodded my friend is putting a tracer on their transmissions hell be able to pinpoint the exact location on hades that theyre being sent to chandler considered the possibilities for a moment then grimaced i dont know if that will be of much use to us he said its probably relayed half a dozen times before it reaches her he paused but id like to know where its sent from were working on it answered jade in the meantime youve got your own work cut out for you what do you mean the blue devil you want the one who sent the transmission my friend told me about is named kraef timo i dont know what his function is but it must be something pretty damned important what makes you think so asked chandler hes got half a dozen bodyguards how could your friend possibly know that i thought he just checked transmissions i have other friends said jade and one of them is a local policeman whos on my payroll once i got kraef timos name i asked him to run it through his computer just to see if there was anything on him and it turns out that they arrested timo on a very minor violation about five months ago it never even went to court but when they went to his quarters to bring him in he had to call off his bodyguards or thered have been a real bloodbath very interesting said chandler where do i find this timo hes one of the few blue devils who doesnt live in their sector said jade hes got a suite of rooms at the uncut diamond thats a hotel about ten blocks from here i assume his bodyguards stay there with him yes they do is timo likely to be there after dark she shrugged since nobody knows what he does nobody knows his hours she paused are you really sure you want to go up against six armed blue devils i can think of things id rather do but youre going to do it anyway i cant think of a better way to start putting some pressure on her maybe i can get another name from my friend someone who sends transmissions and doesnt have a walking arsenal following him around he shook his head the bodyguards are precisely what makes this one such a desirable target why dont you come back for me in about six hours what are you going to do in the meantime she asked take a nap he said reclining on the airbed ive got a busy night ahead of me he closed his eyes and a moment later he was sound asleep jade stared at him for a long moment then left his room and returned to her own and sat down and for the first time tried to decide whether she really wanted the oracle to come to port maracaibo looking for chandler and his confederates chandler awoke just after sunset ordered dinner and spent the next half hour watching various sporting events on the holoscreen then jade entered his room and approached him are you ready she asked he shook his head lets wait another two or three hours i want to give timos bodyguards a little time to get sleepy good said jade pulling up a chair and sitting down because we have to talk what about about the oracle chandler stared at her go ahead he said im listening why are you trying to lure her to port maracaibo i told you why said chandler i know what you told me she said now i want you to tell me something else what how do you know this is your idea shes no telepath he replied the man who hired me actually spent some time with her some years ago she doesnt have to be a telepath persisted jade i dont think i follow you you told me yourself she can see an infinite number of futures and manipulate things so that the future she wants will come to pass maybe she chose the one future in which you came to port maracaibo and devised this particular plan i doubt it said chandler but even if its true so what my job is to bring her out what if she doesnt want to go with you said jade what if she just needs an excuse to leave hades for what reason how should i know what reason responded jade i just want to know how you can be sure shes not pulling your strings right this moment he sighed the answer to that is that i dont know i dont think she is i dont think she has that kind of power or if she does have it then i dont think she can be held anywhere even hades against her will but even if she is manipulating me into getting her off hades why should i care about it shes just making my job easier i dont know said jade but i feel very uneasy about it if shes manipulating you then shes manipulating me too and i dont like being manipulated i dont know exactly what we can do about it either way replied chandler we can quit right now not a chance he said ive got a contract to fulfill how do you know that she isnt planning to go to war with the democracy maybe kraef timo is the only voice in opposition to hers and shes manipulating us into killing him if she can do that from miles away answered chandler why doesnt she just choose a future in which he chokes to death on his food or trips down a flight of stairs and breaks his neck i dont know admitted jade her face hardened in fact the more i think about this situation the more things i dont know look said chandler either weve got free will or we dont if we do then were doing the right thing if we dont then we cant do anything else anyway so whats the point of worrying about it because we can stop right now if we decide to he smiled and how will you know that the oracle didnt change her mind and choose a future in which we stopped she wearily leaned back on the chair where does it end secondguessing fate asked chandler never thats why its a good idea not to start doesnt it bother you to think that your actions your very thoughts might not be your own she asked but they are my own even if were being manipulated the oracle didnt choose these thoughts and put them into my mind she just arranged things so that these were the ones id think and act upon he paused besides i dont see any viable alternative if i assume shes controlling me then shes controlling me whether i kill kraef timo or walk away from him jade considered his statement well its a practical approach she conceded but it s not very satisfying i think an animal in the forest might have that same viewpoint i spend most of my life with animals in the forest replied chandler very few of them have high blood pressure or heart attacks maybe they know something we dont know they dont know anything said jade they just react they stay warm and dry and well fed he noted when all is said and done thats all most humans are really trying to do youre not a very comforting person to talk to javier she said i come to you with serious doubts and you give me a lecture on animals im not in the comfort business i know i suppose ill have to make my decision without any help from you what decision whether i should help you or stop you jade said bluntly id very much like your help though i can accomplish my mission without it said chandler with equal bluntness id strongly advise you not to try to stop me she stared at him for a long moment i still have to make up my mind she said at last let me know when you do youll be the first to know she got up and left the room chandler waited another twenty minutes then got up and walked to the false closet it opened after scanning his retina and registering it against its data base and a moment later he was standing in the sunken garage he decided against borrowing jades vehicle since he didnt know port maracaibos traffic laws and also had no idea where he could leave it while he went about his business he walked over to a gentle incline followed it up to a door at ground level opened it and a moment later found himself in a small alley behind the womb he followed it for two blocks then turned onto a main street asked a passerby how to find the uncut diamond and caught a coach that seemed to be going in the right direction he was annoyed that jade had forced him to change his schedule hed have been much move comfortable visiting kraef timo after midnight when the blue devils bodyguards had relaxed and a couple of them had perhaps gone off to bed but if she decided to oppose him there was no telling how she might go about it and bringing in some hired killers was certainly not beyond her capabilities the coach passed the uncut diamond a small rather ordinarylooking hotel and he got off at the next street then walked back to the main entrance he felt no need to keep to the shadows or hide his presence since nobody here knew him anyway he walked into a darkened cocktail lounge off to the left of the registration desk was struck by the rancid odor of alien intoxicants realized that he was one of the few humans in the room and dialed a beer on the computer menu he nursed it for about fifteen minutes keeping an eye on the hotel entrance though the hotel catered almost exclusively to aliens no blue devils entered or left he hadnt really expected to see any and he decided that it was time to find out where kraef timos suite was located there was no guest register nor could he have read one if there was the house vidphones were out of the question too he was sure the desk wouldnt release the room number and asking would just alert timo to his presence the hotel was only five floors tall he could simply check each floor for blue devils but it was unlikely that any of timos bodyguards were posted outside the suite finally he walked over to a public vidphone booth entered it checked the directory and found a restaurant down the street that delivered around the clock he quickly punched out its combination then smiled into the camera when the connection was made this is mr timo at the uncut diamond he said ive been displeased with room service the last two nights can i get a sandwich and a beer sent over the man at the other end took his order and asked for his room number its in some alien script answered chandler but you cant miss it its the third door to the right of the lift on the seventh floor he hung up walked back to the cocktail lounge and waited half an hour later a young man carrying a bag that obviously contained food entered the hotel walked to the airlift stepped into it and stepped right back out frowning chandler left the lounge and slowly approached the airlift as the young man walked to the desk and exchanged a few words with the lodinite clerk the two of them arrived together and floated up to the fourth level in silence the deliveryman turned to his left checking the numbers on the doors and chandler waited a few seconds then began following him at a leisurely pace the man stopped at a door touched a sensor and waited for it to slide open chandler saw a blue devil approach the deliveryman after which the two exchanged heated words for a minute or two and finally the man left and returned to the airlift chandler leaned against a wall until he was sure the man wasnt going to come back and make a second attempt to deliver his package and get his money then he walked silently down the corridor stopped in front of timos door and reached out to touch the sensor the door opened instantly and a powerfullooking blue devil appeared i told you to go away it said in thickly accented terran chandler reached out and slit his throat without a word then leaped into the room three blue devils were seated in oddlooking chairs he killed all three with a sonic pistol before they realized he was there a laser beam missed his ear by inches and he hurled himself to the floor rolling and firing back as he did so a blue devil shrieked in agony and staggered across the room an ugly green fluid trickling from its ears he fired again and the alien fell motionless to the floor who are you demanded another voice less heavily accented but definitely not human what do you want the voice seemed to be coming from a bedroom off to his left and changing his sonic pistol for a laser gun he fired a beam that seared through the wall at a height of about four feet who are you repeated the voice why does she want me dead chandler felt a brief surge of satisfaction the she that the alien mentioned could only be the oracle which meant that he had indeed chosen the proper target for a moment he considered trying to take timo alive and grilling it thoroughly about the oracle and her plans but he recalled that boma the blue devil they had questioned on port marrakech took its own life rather than reveal any information about the oracle and with at least one more bodyguard unaccounted for chandler didnt think the risk was worth it he fired through the wall once more lower this time and heard a body fall to the floor he waited a full minute for another sound a movement any indication of life within the bedroom then cautiously approached it when he reached the doorway he peered in and saw a blue devil lying on the floor a huge burn mark running the length of its torso he entered the room turned the corpse on its back and looked for some sign or symbol of identification as he was examining the body he saw a sudden motion out of the corner of his eye and as he turned to face the final bodyguard a blue foot kicked the weapon out of his hand the huge blue devil leaned forward reaching out for chandler he responded with two quick kicks against the blue devils leg joints and as the surprised creature was struggling to maintain its balance chandler made a quick slashing motion with his hand then stood back as blood spurted out of the bodyguards throat it rasped hoarsely once glared at chandler for a moment and died chandler locked the door to the corridor and spent the next few minutes making sure there were no more blue devils around then withdrew a small knife made the oracles mark on each corpse and began thoroughly inspecting the suite looking for anything however insignificant that might tell him something more about the oracle and her organization he was rummaging through the very last compartment when jade walked in a pistol in her hand youve had a busy night she said glancing briefly at the corpsestrewn floor how did you get in here he demanded i own this building what are you doing here i came to stop you said jade why because i hadnt decided whether or not i wanted you to kill these blue devils and on my world nobody kills anyone unless i give my permission she paused then continued speaking with a cold fury you said youd wait in your room for two more hours you lied to me i changed my mind he said you lied to me and thats all that matters she replied it could be that for various reasons you didnt want me to come along it could be that youre simply a liar by nature or it could be because she made you lie youre getting paranoid about her said chandler how can you be paranoid about someone with the ability to shape the future she retorted you can underestimate her capacity for harm but i hardly think you can overestimate it she stared at him however thats not the issue here you lied to me and you killed seven blue devils without my permission thats tantamount to disobeying me how can i disobey you said chandler irritably that implies that i take orders from you and nobody gives me orders there are only two options for you while youre on port maracaibo said jade first you can clear your plans with me and obtain my permission and whats the second she pointed the pistol at him i can kill you put that away said chandler you want to expand your operations to hades and im the only man who can make that possible were still on the same side if youre on my side you dont sneak off and commit murders without my approval they heard the sound of footsteps outside the door as a very heavyfooted alien walked to its room this is neither the time nor the place to discuss this said chandler these bodies arent going to stay undiscovered all night he paused timo and one of his bodyguards were in one of the bedrooms for all i know they sent for help before i killed them jade considered his statement then nodded all right she said lowering her pistol well continue this discussion back at the womb they walked quickly to the airlift floated down to the lobby together then left the building did you bring your vehicle he asked its around the corner she replied they entered the landcar and drove back to the womb in silence she pulled into the sunken garage and a moment later they ascended to his room and immediately went to her quarters well what now she asked now we choose another target she shook her head im not helping you until i know that im not being manipulated into it chandler shrugged then ill have to do it myself without my help all youll be doing is slaughtering a bunch of innocent blue devils who may not have any connection to the oracle at all i wont have to kill that many of them responded chandler if i put the oracles insignia on each victim shell either come up here to stop me in a couple of weeks or ill know she cant leave hades and ill have to go after her he paused but it would save me a lot of trouble if i knew who worked for her or communicated with her not until i sort things out said jade adamantly the only thing you have to know is that whether i kill her or take her out youre going to get rich or rather richer said chandler as for the rest of it we simply dont have enough information you could consider the problem halfway to eternity and you still wouldnt know if were doing what she wants or acting on our own theres one piece of information that you havent considered oh what is that you told me that the democracy tried to kill you back on port marrakech why i dont know probably they didnt want me to fulfill my mission which mission asked jade bringing her out or killing her i dont know well its something you ought to consider she continued if theyve managed to learn something about the oracle since you were hired something that makes them think shes too dangerous to be allowed to live then the last thing you want to do is bring her out alive by the same token he replied if youre convinced she can manipulate you and me without our knowing it she can probably manipulate them but why would she have them try to kill you if you were going to bring her out any number of reasons answered chandler first she may be very happy where she is second she may have arranged the attempt on my life knowing id survive it as a way of making me move my base of operations from port marrakech to port maracaibo where id have a better chance of convincing the blue devils to bring her to me third theres every likelihood that shes carrying a grudge against the man who hired me maybe with me dead hed have to come here and try to fulfill the contract himself he paused theres no way to know until i come facetoface with her by that time itll probably be too late said jade i dont know if she can control events from hades but everything youve told me leads me to believe she can control them when shes in the sarne room with you i havent come to kill her answered chandler shell know that but you will kill her if you have to said jade shell know that too unless i know for a fact that shes amenable to coming away with me ill probably have to kill her shes too dangerous to try to deal with shell know that then ill have to put her in such a position where knowing it doesnt do her any good theres no possible way to do that well see replied chandler with more confidence than he felt he paused do you have anything more to say not at the moment then if you dont mind im going to go get something to eat youd better have something sent to your room she said youll want whoever delivers it to be able to testify that you were there he nodded then left her suite and returned to his own quarters he ordered a sandwich and an imported beer and watched the artificial scenery through his window while he waited for the meal to arrive the vidphone flashed and he activated it yes he said the image of a blue devil appeared above the phone it wont work whistler what are you talking about go home whistler said the blue devil go home and stay alive it broke the connection he immediately returned to jade s suite where he found her sitting at her desk staring at a computer with a frown on her face whats the matter she asked looking up it worked he said much faster than i thought it would what worked ive just been warned off by the oracle asked jade in essence he replied by some blue devil how did they find you so quickly he shrugged for all i know theyve been watching me since i landed here and you led them right to the womb not on purpose said chandler besides they contacted me not you they know whos responsible for what happened at the uncut diarnond they have no reason to suspect you of any complicity if they saw you at the uncut diamond then they saw me too what exactly did this blue devil say that what i was doing wouldnt work he paused thats her way of telling me to go in after her youre jumping to conclusions i dont think so maybe the blue devils are trying to scare you off before they have to bring the oracle to port maracaibo chandler shook his head this has the oracles signature on it believe me what makes you so sure because if she wanted me dead the blue devils know where i am they d have sent me a bullet or a laser beam not a vidphone call he paused but if she wants me to bring her out this is exactly the way shed tell me you killed seven blue devils tonight said jade why wouldnt they retaliate regardless of her wishes because she told them not to said chandler and because she and she alone has manipulated things to keep them from being assimilated by the democracy that doesnt make any sense said jade first you make her sound like a prisoner and now youre telling me that theyre afraid to disobey her orders maybe the two arent mutually exclusive suggested chandler maybe as long as she gives them valid information they let her live and if she ever misleads them theyll kill her under those circumstances theyd give her the benefit of the doubt because the alternative would be to kill her and they dont want to do that if there are any other options besides look at her message it sounds like shes dealing from strength and trying to frighten me off jade was silent for almost a full minute finally she looked directly into chandlers eyes you cant go she said chandler frowned more doubts while you were in your room i tied into the master computer on deluros and and i told it to locate any information that was available about the oracle she continued it qualified its information by saying that it was only valid if she had once been known as the soothsayer but some of the details matched what youve told me about her what point are you trying to make asked chandler when she was eight years old she was able to kill some of the best bounty hunters on the inner frontier said jade and that was when she was just a little girl shes a grown woman now and its reasonable to assume that shes even more powerful now than she was then she looked across her desk at chandler she killed eight armed bounty hunters in a single afternoon on a planet called killhaven i dont want any part of her its not worth the risk if she was easier to kidnap or kill the rewards wouldnt be this great dont you see said jade in frustration this woman has the power to hold the democracy at bay those blue devils arent even cold yet and she already knows you killed them if shes being kept on hades against her will then i say good for the blue devils and lets leave her there she paused the blue devil who contacted you gave you good advice go home ive got a job to do first said chandler besides arent you curious to see her and find out what she can really do i am i dont want to be the one who turns her loose on the galaxy you dont have to have anything to do with it he said i just need to find some way to get to the planet without being detected you arent going to have anything to do with it either dont try to stop me he said ominously i wont let her escape from hades she replied firmly you dont have a choice of course i do she said producing her pistol i told you once youre not the only killer in this room i let you live before but im afraid now youve left me with no alternative you really intend to kill me he asked i do how do you know that this isnt what the oracle wants jade frowned as if considering the question and in that instant as her concentration wavered he made a swift motion with his hand she grunted and dropped her pistol as a knife buried itself in her throat chandler walked over to her im sorry he said but you were going to kill me youre a fool she whispered hoarsely youve destroyed us all then she slumped over and died he left her where she was sitting pausing only long enough to retrieve his knife then returned to his room took the airlift down to the garage and walked out into the port maracaibo night part the icemans book the iceman took the shuttle down to philemon ii made his way to the large hexagonal building that was his destination and flashed his temporary pass at the door once inside he walked directly to the information computer queried it briefly and walked to an airlift he was required to display his pass again and undergo a retina scan after which he descended almost two hundred feet below ground level he stepped out into a maze of shining brightly lit corridors waited for an armed soldier to approach him displayed his pass a third time and was ushered to a small waiting room he barely had time to light a small cigar when a door slid back and another soldier stepped through hell see you now mr mendoza the iceman walked to the door then entered a large office as the soldier moved aside and the door closed behind him carlos said looking up from his chrome desk and smiling the wall behind him was filled with the memorabilia of a lifetime devoted to government service including a personally inscribed holograph of the current secretary of the democracy its been a long time twentyfour years give or take a month replied the iceman you havent changed much maybe youd better have your eyesight tested said the iceman im a sixtyfiveyearold man with a potbelly and an artificial leg smiled no you havent changed at all carlos he said always a little too blunt always inclined to disregard a well meant social lie he uttered a terse command to his computer and a chair floated over wont you have a seat the iceman sat down how about a drink name it whatevers wet unless youve changed more radically than i think you havent got anything cheap lying around chuckled in acknowledgment how about some alphardbrandy sounds good said the iceman walked to a wall that appeared to be covered with bookshelves pressed a certain spot on it and a section of the holographic projection vanished to be replaced by a wellstocked bar he filled two glasses with brandy handed one to the iceman and returned to his desk thanks said the iceman its from a new vineyard said straightening the glowing fabric of his expensively tailored tunic which had wrinkled slightly when he sat down im anxious to have your reaction the iceman shrugged what the hell he said ive got all day let me know when you want to talk business you never believed in small talk did you said wryly its your money replied the iceman chatter all you want but when youre through i hope youll get around to telling me why you promised me three million credits if id come to philemon ii i didnt think youd come for less said frankly its my understanding that youve become a very wealthy man i get by but you were still willing to come for three million credits noted its a lot of money just to take a trip theres more where that came from im listening said the iceman weve got a serious situation on our hands carlos said whos we you know who i work for all right youve got a serious situation on your hands what has that got to do with me well to be perfectly candid carlos youre working for me the iceman smiled so you sent bettina bailey or whoever she really was to last chance he paused i knew someone in the democracy sent her but i didnt know who i sent her confirmed and you accepted her commission im working on it to be more precise joshua jeremiah chandler alias the whistler is working on it am i correct the iceman stared levelly at him i see no reason to lie about it hes younger and stronger and a hell of a lot quicker than i am but i hired you in point of fact you didnt hire anyone your operative did and i sent the best man for the job well it may interest you to know that the best man for the job has gone off the deep end said i very much doubt that have you been in contact with him since he reached the alpha crepello system no but i didnt expect to be not this soon the iceman drained his glass then relit his cigar which had gone out id be surprised if he ever contacts you again said do you know what he did when he landed on port marrakech port marrakech one of alpha crepello iiis terraformed moons suppose you tell me said the iceman he murdered the best assassin on the moon and took over his business then he moved his base of operations to port maracaibo where two nights ago he killed the woman who ran most of the brothels and rackets on that moon paused damn it carlos the man has become the criminal kingpin of both moons and i financed him the iceman shook his head youre not telling me everything i certainly am what hes done is a matter of record i know the whistler he has no intention of leaving his home world in fact he only takes assignments to pay for that jungle world he lives on i tell you the man has turned insisted hes in business for himself now slow down a minute said the iceman he began just the way id have begun he set himself up on the first moon this would assuage any fears penelope had that he had come after her and would make it easier for him to buy information about her obviously he was successful but if he was there was no reason for him to move to the second moon hes turned renegade the iceman shook his head again he wasnt on the first moon long enough to consolidate his holdings something made him change his base of operations he stared at something youre going to have to tell me about if this conversation is to proceed any further stared at him then sighed deeply someone tried to kill him one of your men no but one of the democracys were not the only department concerned with the oracle come on said the iceman disbelievingly they were your men and you decided it was the most efficient way to eliminate him he paused so the whistler found out you were trying to terminate him and he moved to another moon the only thing that surprises me is that he didnt change his identity he did then how do you know he was there he killed a woman known as the jade queen a number of people who worked for her gave us his description i assume you havent picked him up hes vanished completely said but its just a matter of time before he surfaces again he hasnt had time to establish his authority there yet the iceman looked amused the years havent made you any wiser i see where do you think hell show up hes probably on alpha crepello iii by now then why did he kill the jade queen i have no idea i dont buy it said every move hes made since arriving has been directed toward taking over the criminal networks on those two moons have it your way said the iceman nonchalantly i didnt come here to argue with you you came here because i paid you to thats right agreed the iceman and for three million credits the very least i can do is listen to your ramblings politely look said irritably i told you we had a problem even if youre right about his reaching alpha crepello we still have a problem im still listening word has come down that we dont want to risk bringing the oracle out my new orders are to terminate her i wish you luck said the iceman i need more than luck said i need results he paused will the whistler kill her only if he cant find a way to bring her out answered the iceman in case its slipped your mind thats what you paid for can you contact him and tell him the situation has changed asked after what happened on port marrakech i doubt that hell believe me even though i had nothing to do with the attempt on his life i doubt it said the iceman thoughtfully if he s on the planet hell stay undercover until he reaches her your best bet is to send someone else in after her and hope your new operative reaches her first ive sent eight men in said the first seven were killed what about the eighth grimaced the eighth was a criminal that i had released from jail brilliant planner brutal killer paused i had him wired all the way camera in his eye transmitter in his ear even a bomb in his skull to keep him in line and the son of a bitch found a way to disconnect me said furiously hes already held me up for more money and hes operating without any guidance or constraint the iceman grinned i like him already hes also got orders to kill your man if he shows up on hades hades thats the trade name for alpha crepello iii why is he supposed to kill the whistler because the democracy has decided that it would rather have her dead than alive and abroad in the galaxy it wont work said the iceman after some thought the whistlers as good as they come your man wont lay a finger on him i dont care if he kills him or not snapped then im at a loss to understand your problem damn it carlos ive got two men down there one of them is going to try to bring her out and if shes willing to go with him then thats the last thing we want the other knows that ten million credits have been deposited in some secret account that even i havent been able to trace and he knows hes facing a death sentence if we get our hands on him he paused trying to regain his composure my assignment is to terminate the oracle and i have no reason to believe either of the men on hades will accomplish that you could be right agreed the iceman calmly it looks like youve wasted a lot of money its partly your fault said oh how do you figure that there s only one man who knows penelope bailey well enough to do the job you were the one i hired carlos if you took the money you should have done the job yourself im a fat old man with a limp answered the iceman i got you the best there is he may be the best assassin but he doesnt know her you do look said the iceman i want her dead even more than you do she killed someone i cared about and she cost me my leg he put his cigar out but i also know her capacity for harm shes potentially the most dangerous being in the whole damned galaxy maybe in the history of the galaxy so i passed up a chance for personal vengeance to hire you the man most likely to get the job done well hes not getting it done hes killing criminals and taking over their operations ill bet you the three million you promised me that hes either on hades or en route to it but even if youre right hes not going to try to kill her not at first acknowledged the iceman you know her capacities said if she knows hes there and she isnt willing to leave with him what are his chances of killing her just about nil my own man might be able to sneak up on her continued but he has no reason to hes been paid plenty and he has no reason ever to contact me again you cant sneak up on her said the iceman she doesnt have to see you to know youre there she can see whats going to happen next and if she doesnt like it she can change it you see said thats the kind of thing that the whistler and jimmy two feathers dont know thats why i need you jimmy two feathers repeated the iceman surprised you sent the injun in after her you know him i know of him hes a seedchewer thats why i had him wired well you can forget about him said the iceman if hes not under your control hes floating off in limbo somewhere there are no seeds on hades the iceman stared at him you really believe that dont you we monitor every cargo shipment to hades if theres a planet they cant smuggle seed to it hasnt been discovered yet thats neither here nor there said if hes on the seed thats all the more reason why you have to go in i dont have to do anything said the iceman youre paying me three million credits to listen to you nothing more theres lots more im a rich man i dont need it and theres the chance for vengeance you dont take vengeance on a hurricane or an ion storm said the iceman theyre forces of nature if you survive an encounter with them you count yourself lucky and you make sure that it never happens again he paused penelopes the same thing a force of nature id love to see somebody kill her i dont think it can happen and im not dumb enough to volunteer i had my shot at her when i was a lot younger and stronger and i was lucky to come away alive you sound very cool and dispassionate said but i researched you thoroughly carlos you followed every lead you could get your hands on for fourteen years you traveled all over the inner frontier looking for her thats not the behavior of a man whos afraid to face her again in the beginning i hunted her with a passion admitted the iceman i wont deny it but a man cant survive on hatred for fourteen years after a while the blood cools and the passion fades and toward the end i was hunting her more out of curiosity than hatred i wanted to find out what she had become how she had managed to stay hidden all these years what her plans were shes only two systems away from here said and you still dont know the answers to your questions when shes ready to move well all know finished his brandy and looked across the desk at the iceman we cant afford to find out he said weve got to kill her now maybe all she wants is to be left alone if you had those powers would you want to be left alone to live in obscurity demanded no but but what but im human said the iceman she probably isnt not anymore thats all the more reason to terminate her if you say so ten million credits said the iceman made no answer but stared at some fixed point on the wall well said be quiet said the iceman im thinking computing expenses i said be quiet looked at the iceman then shrugged and was silent the iceman remained motionless for almost a minute then turned back to youve got a big problem on your hands he said thats what ive been explaining to you the iceman shook his head its not the one you think what are you talking about its been so long since ive seen her that i tend to forget what she can do said the iceman youve got two men on hades one that we know of take my word youve got two there said the iceman all right for the sake of argument said what has that got to do with anything why are they still alive looked confused i dont think i understand the question why didnt the injuns ship crash when it landed why was the whistler able to kill whoever it was he killed on the moons you think she wants them alive asked why there s only one reason i can think of answered the iceman shes being held against her will and wants them to bring her out against her will repeated how is that possible i dont know but i know if she didnt want to leave the injun wouldnt have been alive long enough to get your tampering undone the surgeon would have sneezed or flinched at the wrong moment and hed never have survived he paused you were right if you cant call the whistler off youll have to kill him and probably the injun too if she wants to leave hades then youve got to stop her my orders are to kill her fuck your orders said the iceman you had her when she was six years old and you couldnt keep her even then i tried to kill her when she was eight and i failed but now somehow the inhabitants of hades have actually managed to keep her there against her will all these years even though her powers have doubtless matured he stared at you let her off that planet and there will be hell to pay she doesnt need a navy to conquer a world all she has to do is choose the one future out of a million in which its star explodes or a meteor plows into it give her an army of five thousand men and she would win any battle against any force in the galaxy just by picking and choosing which outcome she wants for each skirmish she probably cant be killed but she can be contained theyre containing her right now if youre right then these are the perfect conditions under which to assassinate her persisted you still dont understand said the iceman lets say shes locked up in a cell if you tried to shoot her shed cough or sneeze or twitch or do something that would bring about the one future in which you blew the lock off the door weve still got to try no snapped the iceman once and for all try to understand what im saying to you theyve found a way to contain her wed be crazy to tamper with it but we cant just sit back and do nothing protested we could have before you hired me and sent the injun after her said the iceman but like i said youve got a big problem on your hands the first one of them to reach her is going to free her whether he means to or not he paused for a very long moment put the ten million in my account he said reluctantly im going to have to go in after them i thought you didnt want any part of it i dont said the iceman but im the only one who can call the whistler off hell kill anyone else you send what about the injun if hes on the seed hes off in dreamland somewhere and if he tries to kill the whistler you can bury whats left of him but if hes clean and he cant find the whistler hell be going after the oracle then ill have to find him and stop him as you pointed out youre a fat old man with one leg said what makes you think you can stop him he wont know why im there and he has no reason to kill me answered the iceman and hopefully ill have the whistler on my side he stared grimly across the desk at youve only got one other alternative what is it blow up the whole damned planet and do it with unmanned ships that have been programmed thousands of lightyears away we cant kill two hundred million blue devils just to get rid of someone who might constitute a threat protested weve done a lot worse in the past said the iceman i will not go down in history as a genocidal maniac the iceman sighed then ill have to go to hades and try to find the whistler and the injun before they find her what makes you think shell let you land ill find a way thats part of what youre paying me for considered all he had heard for a long moment then shook his head in confusion i just dont know he said at last when you lay it out it sounds reasonable he sighed but when all is said and done im supposed to have her assassinated and here we are talking about how to keep the two assassins from reaching her its up to you said the iceman im an old man i imagine i can live out my life before she turns the democracy inside out he got to his feet im going back up to my ship ill stay docked in orbit for ten more hours im sure youve recorded our conversation play it to whoever can change your orders if i dont hear from you by then ill assume youre still going to try to kill her and ill go back to last chance it didnt take ten hours or even eight five hours later the democracy transferred ten million credits to the icemans account on last chance and ten minutes after that the iceman activated his ship and took off for hades wondering whether he would live long enough to spend a single credit of his money as he approached the planet his radio came to life you are approaching alpha crepello iii said an accented voice please identify yourself this is the space mouse registration number kp five galactic standard days out of last chance via philemon ii carlos mendoza commanding alpha crepello iii is closed to all unauthorized visitors let me speak to whoever is in charge said the iceman that is impossible i have vital information to convey to him what is the nature of your information my information is not for underlings replied the iceman i must speak to your superior i have explained that this is impossible then give me your name and military identification number said the iceman i want to know who to blame when your commander asks why he was not contacted there was a momentary silence please wait said the voice at last the iceman allowed himself the luxury of a smile and opened a container of beer while he waited for his demand to get passed up the chain of command to someone who would finally accept responsibility it took eleven minutes then the image of a blue devil its outfit bedecked with glittering stones that the iceman took to be medals appeared on his viewscreen i am praed tropo said the blue devil youre in charge i am in a position of authority what information have you for me its very sensitive answered the iceman id much rather tell you in person you are not allowed to land on alpha crepello iii not even to save the oracles life asked the iceman there was no change in the blue devils expression but its voice seemed to drop half an octave continue it said there is a human assassin currently on alpha crepello iii who has been hired to terminate the oracle this assassin does not work for the democracy in fact the democracy which does not want to be involved in an interplanetary incident has assigned me the task of stopping him to do this i will need your assistance the oracle is in no danger replied praed tropo she cannot be harmed the democracy controls more than fifty thousand worlds and this is the best assassin on any of them said the iceman are you sure you care to take that chance if he is the best assassin how do you propose to stop him i dont answered the iceman i am an old man well past my prime but i know his methods and i can identify him i hope to enlist your aid in apprehending him transmit his holograph and retinagram to us and we will attend to him said praed tropo i have accepted a commission of ten million credits to apprehend him said the iceman this money is payable only upon the successful completion of my assignment and the democracy will have no reason to pay me if i turn the job over to you either we work together or i return to last chance and your oracle can take her chances why should i believe you demanded praed tropo you can authenticate my story with the man who hired me said the iceman why should i believe any man hed been waiting for that question now it was time to play his trump card the offer on which he was willing to wager his life i will be happy to put myself in your custody until you are convinced that i am telling the truth surely you have the equivalent of a lie detector i will willingly submit to interrogation while monitored by any such mechanism i will need time to consider this said praed tropo i understand said the iceman but you must understand that every minute you delay works in the assassins favor and the less time you have to come up with a question im unprepared for the better this time the silence lasted for less than thirty seconds we will transmit landing coordinates to your ship said praed tropo all weapons systems must be disarmed or you will be destroyed i have no weapons systems answered the iceman we are transmitting now the iceman touched down at a military spaceport some forty minutes later stepped out into the incredibly hot air of hades and was immediately taken into custody by a squadron of blue devils they marched him into a nearby building where praed tropo was waiting for him you realize that if we discover that you have lied to us you will be imprisoned and quite probably executed was praed tropos greeting to him i do answered the iceman but once you find out im telling you the truth i trust that youll be willing to work with me we shall see look said the iceman im just an independent businessman trying to become more independent personally i dont care whether your oracle lives a million years or dies tomorrow what is that to me said praed tropo im trying to tell you that you can trust me because im motivated by the most basic human emotion greed i have no reason to lie to you and every reason to tell you the truth if you are indeed telling the truth you have nothing to worry about mendoza replied praed tropo follow me praed tropo began walking down a corridor and the iceman still accompanied by the squadron of blue devils fell into step behind him it wasnt like any corridor the iceman had ever seen before it was as if it had been designed by a drunken architect and built by madmen the ceiling rose to a height of fifteen feet then dropped to the point where they all had to bend bver to keep from bumping their heads then rose again it zigged and zagged for no discernible purpose passing no doorways or rooms along the way and finally when he was convinced that they had completed a very erratic circle and were about to wind up where they had started it abruptly terminated in a large room the walls were set at oblique angles to each other and the ceiling rose and fell like a wave on a turbulent ocean at the far end of the room was a row of machines none of which bore any resemblance to anything with which the iceman was familiar and near one of them was a chair not a chair constructed for human use but as he stared at it the iceman decided that a blue devil would probably be just as uncomfortable on it as he would he was led to the chair and told to sit down then praed tropo placed a small metal disk on the back of his neck and another on his left wrist four blue devils trained their weapons on him we are now prepared to interrogate you said the blue devil if you should lie you will receive a nearlethal correction that will affect your nerve centers do you understand yes replied the iceman should you attempt to escape before the interrogation is completed you will be shot do you understand yes very well said praed tropo what is your name carlos mendoza what is your home planet last chance we have no record of a last chance its official name is madison iv why are you here mendoza here it comes thought the iceman keep calm dont get excited and choose your words very carefully do it right and you can beat this machine i have come to alpha crepello iii to prevent an assassin named chandler from carrying out his assignment he waited for a jolt and relaxed when it didnt occur what is chandlers assignment he is a hired killer who has come for the oracle how do you know this careful i am on intimate terms with the man who hired him and who hired you to prevent him from carrying out his assignment a highlevel official in the democracy i dont know his real name but his code name is he is currently stationed on philemon ii he has offered to pay me ten million credits if i accomplish my mission how did this chandler manage to land on alpha crepello iii asked praed tropo i dont know where is he now i dont know but you know that he has definitely been commissioned to assassinate the oracle pause take a deep breath construct your answer precisely think i know that when the circumstances are right he will try to kill her the iceman half expected to be jolted by a nearlethal shock but nothing happened have you met this chandler personally continued praed tropo yes and you can identify him yes what good is that to us if he is the master of disguise you claim him to be i know his methods ill know him when i see him you are absolutely sure of this said praed tropo there is no doubt in your mind i am absolutely sure of it repeated the iceman there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind he paused if that answers your questions can you disconnect me from this device now im very uneasy being attached to it and im afraid that it may misinterpret my nervousness as false answers youll be disconnected when i am through questioning you answered praed tropo and not until then he asked the iceman the same set of questions three more times then had him supply a list of chandlers known victims he sounds quite formidable admitted the blue devil at last hes supposed to be the best said the iceman i still do not understand why the democracy is attempting to stop him it would seem to be in their best interest to have him assassinate the oracle it is she and she alone who has kept us independent the icemans first inclination was to remain silent since no question had been asked then he realized that he had better make some response before the question could be worded in a lethal way i assure you that the democracy does not want chandler to succeed in his mission it is my understanding that they attempted to kill him on port marrakech but he survived praed tropo stared at him for a long moment i will ask you once more directly has the democracy hired this assassin to kill the oracle this assassin concentrate on this they dont mean the injun theyve never heard of the injun this assassin is the whistler only the whistler and im the one who told him to kill her if he couldnt bring her out the democracy knew nothing about it they wanted her alive and hes only talking about the whistler not the injun only the whistler and i told him to not the democracy you seem hesitant to answer said praed tropo has the democracy hired this assassin to kill the oracle no said the iceman once more has the democracy hired chandler to kill the oracle no thats it youve learned everything you can from me theres no sense asking about the oracle im just a smalltime informer how could i know about her probably i dont even know shes a human rather than a blue devil why would i know the oracle nobody would even have told me about her powers just dont ask about her and ive won just dont ask about the oracle have you any loyalty to the democracy asked praed tropo none if they asked you to lie for them would you it all depends on what does it depend on what benefits i would derive from lying economic benefits thats right and have you lied to me he means during this interrogation hes not referring to anything i said on the ship thats obvious he means have i lied while i was hooked up to the machine the question only applies to this interrogation only to the machine no praed tropo checked the machine and then nodded to one of his underlings who removed the disks from the icemans neck and wrist the iceman stood up suddenly realized just how uncomfortable the chair had been and stretched the knots out of his muscles satisfied he said for the moment replied praed tropo then wed better get busy because chandlers got a hell of a head start on us head start an advantage explained the iceman hes been here for days for all i know hes within striking distance of the oracle right now the oracle is in no danger answered praed tropo ive already told you that this man is the best assassin in the democracy it makes no difference the oracle cannot be killed the iceman saw an opportunity to display his ignorance of the oracle and took it any blue devil can be killed praed tropos face contorted into what the iceman assumed was a look of amusement she is not of my race it said but of yours then whats she doing on alpha crepello iii that is not for you to know well if shes human thats all the more reason to protect her said the iceman if theres one thing chandler knows how to do its kill humans he cannot kill her repeated praed tropo if youre so damned sure of that why did you let me land asked the iceman because an assassin is loose on the planet and he must be apprehended the iceman forced a puzzled frown to his face but if youre convinced he cant kill the oracle why because he can kill those members of my race who are in daily contact with the oracle what makes the oracle so immune to assassination praed tropo ignored the question and ushered him back down the long crazily winding corridor to the buildings entrance then it stopped and turned to the iceman we have no human foodstuffs here you will be escorted to your ship where you will bring supplies sufficient for three days what if it takes more than three days to apprehend chandler then i will reassess the situation just a minute said the iceman if you dont have any human food what does the oracle eat we have no food for you answered praed tropo youre operating under deep cover whistler so the odds are you can t find out who delivers her food but if the injun isn t lost in some seedchewers dreamworld hell have figured it out by now and that means hes closer to her than you are and i canexpect him to show up first if hes stayed off the seed and that means that if i have to sacrifice one of you it will probably be the lnjun who ill claim to be you which is just as well because its been years since i was good enough to kill you if indeed i ever was i just wish i knew what the hell the injun looks like once i get my food what then he asked aloud then i will take you to a place where we can call up the holographs of every human known to be on the planet answered praed tropo and if chandler is among them we will arrest and incarcerate him what if hes not among them or if i identify his holograph but we cant find him then we will alert our security forces and when he approaches the oracle we will apprehend him may i make a suggestion said the iceman you may chandlers too good at his trade to be taken that easily maybe ill spot his holograph and maybe i wont but the odds are that hes already working his way to wherever it is that the oracle resides and he wont approach her directly only a fool would do that on a planet where every human is suspect only a fool or perhaps a gimpy old man whos so far past his prime that he can no longer operate covertly he amended silently what is the point you are making mendoza asked praed tropo hes a cautious man continued the iceman he wont make a move until he knows the functon and schedule of every blue devil who guards the oracle the iceman paused now if you beef up your security forces around her hell just outwait you i dont know how much hes being paid for this job but its got to be enough so that he can spend a year or two waiting for the right opportunity he turned to praed tropo but he knows me and he has no reason to distrust me if youll put me in a conspicuous position somewhere near the oracles headquarters i think hell contact me before he acts why should he because i have no business being here and hell be curious hell want to know if were business rivals or if i bear some new instructions from his employer or just what reason i have for being on the planet how will this benefit us asked praed tropo you are an old man he is a professional assassin how can you possibly take him into custody i cant answered the iceman but there is a chance that i can lead him into custody i can tell him that theres been a change in plans and that we have to go to some predetermined place to discuss it a place where you will be waiting for him why should he believe you queried the blue devil why shouldnt he because as you say you have no business being on alpha crepello iii your presence alone may serve to alarm him its a possibility admitted the iceman but what can he do you assure me that the oracle is invulnerable if my plan works youll have him in custody an hour later if it doesnt if my presence alarms him hell almost certainly go back into hiding and then your task will be no different than it is now except that youll know the general area that hes hiding in and what if he kills you asked praed tropo im getting paid a lot of money to take that chance i will have to consider your proposition very carefully said praed tropo i do not like giving you such freedom of action if were going to work together said the iceman were going to have to trust each other you are a man replied praed tropo that is reason enough not to trust you but your own machine confirmed that i was telling the truth you answered my questions truthfully acknowledged the blue devil but it is possible that i did not ask the right questions you are a man and yet you have allied yourself with an alien race to kill another man there is no question in my mind that had i not given you permission to land your ship you would have sought some covert means to land on alpha crepello iii this assassin knows and trusts you and you plan to deceive him and lead him into our hands how am i to know what other motivations you might have what other reasons you might possess for being here youre smarter than you look tropo any minute now youre going to think of asking the oracle what to do about chandler youll be afraid to bother her with what you still think of as a wildgoose chase but eventually maybe tomorrow maybe the day after that youll muster up the courage and when you do theres every likelihood that youll mention my name im afraid youre destined for an early death praed tropo well if you come up with a better plan let me know said the iceman i shall just dont take too long remember this man is an accomplished killer and hes been on the planet long enough to pinpoint the oracles location a lot of lives depend on our moving quickly including mine praed tropo still had not decided what course of action to take by the end of the day and the iceman requested permission to spend the night aboard his ship which was cooler and possessed a comfortable human bed the blue devil at first objected but finally gave his permission once he had climbed aboard and triggered his security system he activated his subspace radio here said the voice at the other end its me said the iceman and youd damned well better be right about this frequency being beyond their capacity to pick up it is where are you on one of the moons im on hades youre on hades itself exclaimed surprised i knew i had the right man when i sent that woman out to approach you you should never have farmed out the job then youd have been trying to kill me replied the iceman dryly there was an awkward pause have you learned anything yet asked i havent found out anything about the whistler if thats what you mean what about jimmy two feathers i dont know where he is but if hes kept off the seed i know where hell show up hes not the one were worried about hell either assassinate the oracle or hell fail and probably get himself killed its chandler weve got to stop may i point out that ive only been on the damned planet for three or four hours said the iceman if he was that easy to stop i wouldnt have hired him and you wouldnt have had to hire me im sorry said with a marked lack of sincerity its just that were very anxious about this whole project we repeated the iceman have you got some kind of pool going on who lives and who dies just be careful admonished if we did have a pool the oracle would be the favorite i know said the iceman but if youll let me speak to one of your demolition experts maybe i can lower the odds ill get one in here right away the sooner the better i still dont trust this frequency the expert arrived a few minutes later the iceman put a number of questions to her received the answers he needed and then deactivated the radio he waited a few minutes to make sure that no one had monitored his conversation and was coming to arrest him then spent the next two hours working with the information he had received finally physically and emotionally drained from the events of the day he lay down on his bunk and was asleep almost instantly praed tropo contacted him via radio the next morning just after sunrise and demanded his presence it was already hot outside and getting hotter by the minute and the iceman took a broadbrimmed hat with him to shade his eyes from the sun i have considered your proposition very carefully said praed tropo as they walked toward a waiting vehicle and i have decided to let you attempt to stop the assassin thank you there is nothing to thank me for mendoza answered the blue devil we are confronting a dangerous situation you are risking your life to resolve it as i told you im being well paid responded the iceman praed tropos expression indicated what he thought of a race that would do anything for money but it made no reply where are we going asked the iceman as they reached the vehicle and praed tropo motioned him to climb into it four armed blue devils were waiting for him and praed tropo joined them a moment later where you want to go answered the blue devil suddenly the windows all darkened and a light came on illuminating the interior of the vehicle the oracles headquarters that is correct said praed tropo since you have no need to know its location i have made the windows opaque the vehicle began moving and the iceman leaned back on his seat trying unsuccessfully to get comfortable for the first time since arriving on hades he became aware of the unpleasant almost bitter odor of the blue devils the vehicle wasnt airconditioned for the blue devils had evolved to cope with the intense heat and his mouth suddenly felt dry after a few minutes he found himself sweating profusely and shortly thereafter his clothes were drenched and his foot squished uncomfortably in his boot how much longer he asked hoarsely perhaps an hour said praed tropo perhaps two wonderful he muttered you are uncomfortable very oh said praed tropo with no show of concern the vehicle sped on and the iceman finally found that he was less uncomfortable if he leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees and cupping his chin in his hands after about ten minutes his back began to ache and he straightened up again aware that he was causing the blue devils untold satisfaction if not outright amusement are we heading toward a city he asked hoping that conversation would take his mind off his discomfort why should you think so answered praed tropo because her headquarters would be harder to pinpoint if they were surrounded by hundreds of other buildings she has no reason to fear attack tell me about her why im risking my life to save her so naturally im curious answered the iceman she is in no danger you are here only to prevent any members of my own race from being harmed why is she called the oracle does she make mystic pronouncements oracle is a terran word replied praed tropo she chose it herself i do not know what it means why is she living among you it is not necessary for you to know that what does she look like asked the iceman like any other member of your race every other member of my race can be killed what makes you so certain that she cant be you ask too many questions mendoza said praed tropo the democracy is paying me a lot of money to save her said the iceman that implies someone else spent a lot of money to have her killed i d like to know what makes her so valuable your claim that she is invulnerable seems like a good place to start be quiet mendoza said praed tropo i find your questions tiring then why not answer them and ill shut up because it has occurred to me as it has doubtless occurred to you that chandler may have been paid more than ten million credits to assassinate the oracle since you know who hired him and since greed is the prime motivating force of all men i consider it quite likely that you yourself will attempt to kill the oracle if you feel the opportunity has presented itself but youve already told me it cant be done the iceman pointed out were you lying to me no said praed tropo but in the process you could kill some members of my race and since you landed here on my authority i would be held responsible for your crimes he paused therefore i will tell you nothing about the oracle you are here to apprehend chandler and nothing more you know thought the iceman when i was younger and stronger i probably would have tried to cut chandler out and kill the oracle myself if my story had been true youre too smart again by half praed tropo if all the blue devils are like you i wonder why your people think they need the oracle well then he said aloud perhaps you can tell me about her headquarters what are its dimensions how many blue devils are guarding it what kind of security systems have been built you will see for yourself when we arrive answered praed tropo fine said the iceman with a sigh there is one thing i will tell you now mendoza good what is it my race is called the lorhn said praed tropo we find the term blue devils offensive i assure you no offense was intended ive only heard you referred to as blue devils we call you men as you prefer rather than it uttered a word that was unpronounceable in terran and we have learned to speak terran though it bears no relation to our own language and is painful to our throats it paused and yet although the democracy knows we are the lorhn it persists in calling us blue devils and does not teach its diplomats or its operatives our language is it any wonder that we have no desire to be assimilated by you im no politician or operative said the iceman im just a businessman and from this moment forward ill be happy to refer to you as lorhn if you feel the democracy has treated your race with disrespect tell them i have no intercourse with the democracy nor do i expect to have any unless they invade us said praed tropo i am telling you because if you survive i will expect you to relay my message to them consider it done lied the iceman the blue devil fell silent again and the iceman totally out of questions rode in mute discomfort after another hour he felt the vehicle turn to the left and suddenly the sound of the wind was broken by large structures either buildings or natural formations then it began slowing down and in another mile it stopped we have arrived announced praed tropo as the windows became transparent once more the icemans eyes began watering at the broad expanse of sand that reflected the intense sunlight and it took him almost a minute before he could begin focusing the first thing he saw was the building beautifully camouflaged in a depression beneath a large outcropping of rock it was a crazily irregular structure but if a wall with right angles had been built around it the iceman estimated that it would be close to four hundred feet on a side the quartz roof reflecting a dazzling array of reds oranges and golds with blue metal girders supporting it immediately caught his eye it seemed much more intricate than necessary even if it served as a solar energy collector he looked for windows and doors found a few where they shouldnt have been and almost none where he expected them to be and shrugged hed been on enough alien worlds not to try to make sense out of their structures if they thought a roof should be fifty feet high at one point and ten feet at another with no rhyme or reason to justify the sudden changes that was fine by him all he was concerned about was the woman who resided beneath that roof at the far end of the building was a huge triangular door and after he praed tropo and the four armed blue devils climbed out of the vehicle the driver started it up again and drove through the doorway into what the iceman assumed was an enormous garage there were eleven blue devils pacing the grounds walking in intricate patterns that seemed totally unrelated to one another none of them were armed who are they asked the iceman they are members of the houses staff what are they doing they are performing their religious rituals answered praed tropo they make awfully easy targets noted the iceman then they will join our god that much sooner replied the blue devil with a shrug and what are these asked the iceman indicating a number of stone structures scattered around the landscape they look rather like fountains what is a fountain the iceman explained it and praed tropo looked disapproving we have no water to spare for such nonessential purposes then i repeat what are they monuments denoting where various lorhn have fallen in defense of the oracle it paused in every case they were killed by agents of the democracy then it would seem that the democracy has hired me to make amends said the iceman for men to make amends is contrary to my expenencc said praed tropo youve been associating with the wrong men said the iceman easily i will give you every opportunity to prove me wrong mendoza answered the blue devil but i expect that you will prove to be no different from the rest you know you object to my calling your race blue devils and im making an attempt to abide by your wishes said the iceman but you keep making generalizations about my race that you know to be false nothing i have said is false you have stated or implied that men are not to be trusted and that we hold your race in contempt that is true you forget the oracle said the iceman shes a member of my race and yet you trust her praed tropo stared at the iceman for a long moment and then spoke i repeat nothing i have said is false the iceman was still considering what praed tropo had said as they toured the grounds which way do you think chandler will approach asked the blue devil when they had finished their inspection the iceman placed his hands on his hips and surveyed the landscape difficult to say he replied i assume the fence on the west side is electrified our security system does not use electricity answered praed tropo it is too easy to disable at the source the fence has a selfgenerating field that will kill anything that touches it how about that overhang asked the iceman indicating the huge rock that towered over the house it cannot be scaled not by a lorhn perhaps but it wouldnt be that difficult for a human could you scale it asked praed tropo skeptically the iceman smiled and shook his head no but ive got a prosthetic leg and ive never really learned to use it properly theres some nerve damage to my hip twenty years ago i could have climbed it with no trouble i shall deploy forces to guard all approaches to the overhang said praed tropo after some thought i wouldnt if i were you why not asked the blue devil suspiciously youre not dealing with an amateur here replied the iceman hell spot anyone you post there and he wont try to come into the compound and if he doesnt come in then theres no way i can contact him you are certain the only way hell enter the compound under those circumstances is if he kills every lorhn you post there and its my understanding that thats what youve brought me here to prevent that is true admitted praed tropo but if we follow this philosophy throughout our defenses it is almost certain that chandler will at least reach the spot where we are standing without being apprehended that s the whole purpose of the exercise answered the iceman weve got to entice him to breach your defenses or i wont be able to identify him and warn him off and what if you cant warn him off asked praed tropo what if having come this far he elects to kill you he has no reason to kill me men lie to each other all the time why should he believe what you tell him because he knows me that is an inadequate answer im sorry because its the best answer youre going to get replied the iceman besides what difference does it make to you if he kills me or not you insist that no one can kill the oracle at least this way youll know where he is and you can make sure he doesnt get out praed tropo was silent for a moment logical it said at last im glad we agree on something said the iceman what do you suggest for the rest of the perimeter asked the blue devil it is possible to deactivate the fences not a good idea answered the iceman we want to pick and choose his approaches if you just let him come in at random i might never see him praed tropo stared at him a strange expression on its face is something wrong asked the iceman no answered the blue devil you are acting out your part very well im not acting any part protested the iceman irritably im trying to earn my commission i still do not trust you mendoza said praed tropo but you have been very careful not to make a mistake if you had suggested that we deactivate the fence i would know you were an agent for the assassin and i would have immediately imprisoned you it paused i will continue to work with you but sooner or later i expect you to make an error and i will be waiting for it you are doomed to be disappointed said the iceman i have always expected the worst from men answered praed tropo and i have never yet been disappointed if youre going to continue telling me what a treacherous race i belong to can we at least walk over to some shade asked the iceman if i stand out here much longer i may not live long enough to prove to you that im telling the truth praed tropo led him to a bizarrely shaped leanto that seemed to have no purpose except to provide shade to anyone who was willing to bend over at the waist arent you uncomfortable asked the iceman staring at the slightly taller blue devil you asked for shade i have provided it this is getting ridiculous said the iceman your furniture and vehicles are bad enough but if im going to roast to death i dont see why i have to do it while im bent in half you should have considered that before accepting an assignment on alpha crepello iii replied praed tropo stepping back out into the sunlight look said the iceman also stepping out from under the leanto and straightening up painfully i know that you enjoy my discomfort but my race wasnt built for this kind of heat and im a very old man youre going to have to provide me with some comfortable shadeand i emphasize the word comfortable if im to stay outside and wait for chandler to show up he will almost certainly arrive under cover of darkness answered praed tropo our nights are quite cool i experienced one of your nights thanks theyre only cool if youre a lorhn the iceman paused do you know what an umbrella is no ill draw one for you said the iceman i want one of your lorhn to construct one for me and ill need plenty of water water is very rare on alpha crepello iii not as rare as assassins shot back the iceman if you want me to stop him youve got to keep me alive until he shows up praed tropo seemed to consider his request i will see what can be done it said at last good praed tropo stared at him for a moment you have not yet inspected the entrances to the property which are used by vehicles it said indicating two driveways do you feel strong enough to inspect them lets get it over with said the iceman they had checked the first of them and were walking to the second when the iceman suddenly stopped overcome by dizziness what is the matter mendoza asked praed tropo heat prostration i think mumbled the iceman ive got to get out of the sun how does one treat heat prostration in a human i dont know said the iceman grabbing praed tropos arm for support ive never had it before get me to someplace cool and if i pass out find a way to get some fluids in me just water i dont think my system can take anything the lorhn drink praed tropo summoned two other blue devils the icemans last memory was of being half carried and half dragged into the foyer of the huge building then he lost consciousness when he awoke he was lying on the floor of a small cubicle next to an oddlyshaped cot even in his weakened dehydrated condition he had evidently decided that the floor was more comfortable he stood up leaned against a stone wall for support and surveyed his surroundings the cubicle was perhaps eight feet on a side just enough for the cot a small multileveled table and an intercom holoscreen there was a container of water on the table he immediately picked it up spent almost a minute figuring out how to open it and then took two long swallows it was warm and there were small things floating in it things that he didnt want to think about but it tasted like heaven he wanted to drink more to drain the container but he seemed to remember reading or hearing somewhere that he should drink frequently but in moderation until he regained his strength he took a tentative step then another and found that he wasnt as weak as he had anticipated obviously the blue devils had gotten him out of the sun before any serious damage had been done the door to his cubicle was closed he had no idea if it was locked and at the moment he didnt particularly care it would be another hour or so before he could take advantage of being here anyway if indeed there was any advantage to be taken by being inside the building he walked from wall to wall a few more times getting some of the stiffness out of his body then sat delicately on the edge of the cot and just luxuriated in being out of hades sunlight in fact the room was still quite warm perhaps thirtysix degrees celsius but it felt cool and comfortable compared to being outside he waited another five minutes then got up and began walking back and forth again feeling stronger this time it was as he approached the far wall that he heard the voice i see youre finally awake iceman said a cold dispassionate vaguely familiar voice he turned and found himself staring at the image of a slender young woman on the holoscreen he studied the face the cheekbones were more prominent the chin a little sharper the hair a bit darker but they were definitely hers only the eyes had really changed they seemed strange distant almost alien its been a long time he said at last fourteen years replied penelope bailey part the oracles book im getting sick and tired of waiting remarked the injun as he and broussard sat in his room at the embassy i think its just about time to go to work i thought you werent going to make a move until the whistler showed up said broussard for all i know the blue devils killed him on one of the moons and he wont be showing up at all the injun got to his feet and started pacing the room restlessly while broussard stared at him and tried to understand the change that had come over him during the past few days he had grown more irritable more restless and had been given to violent outbursts of temper it just didnt jibe with the cool professional with whom broussard had been working and the young man was sincerely worried about the injuns mental state where the hell is he muttered the injun slamming a fist into the wall i cant wait much longer theres no deadline on killing the oracle sir said broussard or if there is you havent told me about it ive got a personal deadline snapped the injun and ive just about reached it a personal deadline repeated broussard puzzled just shut up and let me think i can leave the room if you wish sir leave stay what you do doesnt interest me he continued pacing the room faster and faster and after watching him for another few minutes broussard walked to the door and went to his own quarters deeply troubled about the change that had occurred to his superior finally the injun came to a stop in front of his computer and stared at it as if it was some alien machine he had never seen before finally his eyes which had seemed wild and unfocused cleared and he sat down next to it computer activate he commanded activated replied the computer check all planetary data bases and tell me if joshua jeremiah chandler also known as the whistler has arrived on hades yet checking unknown damn muttered the injun he was about to begin walking around the room again when it hit him computer he yelled yes every other time ive asked you you said no this time you said unknown why because a human has landed at the polid kreba military base and i have been unable to ascertain his identity thats got to be him said the injun has he been incarcerated unknown it doesnt matter said the injun if hes in jail hell rot there and there s no sense waiting any longer and if he s not then he s talked his way out of a military base and probably has freedom of movement and ive got to move tonight the computer made no reply as no question had been put to it deactivate ordered the injun the computer went dark and the injun walked out of his room went down the hall and entered broussards room im going after her tonight he announced youre quite certain sir asked broussard obviously concerned of course im certain said the injun the whistler has landed on hades youre sure of that the computer confirms it the computer says that the whistler has landed repeated broussard then why didn t it show up on our immigration lists he landed at a blue devil military base why would he do that how the hell should i know snapped the injun irritably hes here and that s all that matters what name is he using asked broussard i dont know broussard frowned then how do you know its the whistler who else would land in this godforsaken hellhole without going through customs and immigration the injun paused im going to need your help sir i dont mean to offend or to be insubordinate but i wish youd undergo a psychological evaluation first said broussard the injun glared at him what are you saying do you think im crazy no sir answered broussard but you havent been yourself lately i will be soon said the injun youre nervous and shorttempered and youve become forgetful continued broussard i dont think youre in any condition to confront the oracle ill be fine said the injun struggling to control the rage and hunger that surged through him believe me i still wish youd present yourself to our staff psychologist he wont tell me anything i dont already know answered the injun look im going to go out there tonight with or without you but it would make my life a lot easier if youll come all i need you to do is drive me to the same spot we went to the other day ill take care of everything else he paused and stared at the young man now are you in or out broussard uttered a sigh of resignation i cant let you go out there alone good said the injun we leave at twilight broussard turned to leave one more thing said the injun sir i appreciate your concern for me and i realize that you have my best interests at heart he paused but if you or anyone else tries to stop me youll find out just how good a killer i am broussard drew himself up to his full height that was unnecessary sir he replied with dignity lets hope so they left at twilight and took the main road out of town driving at a leisurely pace traffic thinned out within twenty minutes and vanished completely after half an hour none of this looks familiar said the injun squinting into the darkness where are all the rocks well reach them in another forty minutes sir said broussard the injun leaned back and closed his eyes you havent told me your plan yet sir remarked broussard i know you do have one dont you the injun patted his tunic right here in my pocket a gun said broussard the injun smiled that too two armed blue devils entered the icemans cubicle and silently ushered him down a long darkened corridor then up a ramp down another corridor and finally came to a halt at a large door where praed tropo was waiting for him she wants to see you mendoza it said so i gathered do not approach her i dont understand said the iceman you will he uttered a low command and the door receded revealing a large luxurious room almost fifty feet on a side there were beds chairs desks tables even a holoscreen each of them designed for the comfort of a human occupant the occupant herself stood about thirty feet away tall slender with dark blonde hair and pale blue eyes that seemed to be looking through the iceman into some hidden place that only she could see welcome to my domain iceman she said hello penelope you have seen her before said praed tropo surprised a long time ago answered the iceman i had thought we would never meet again said the oracle i thought you would die where i left you but i was very young and my abilities were immature and now youre an adult said the iceman now i am an adult she replied vacantly as if her attention were directed elsewhere now i see things more clearly more vividly and now i interpret them more accurately what kind of things things that would drive you mad if you were to see them iceman she paused a million futures all struggling to be born a trillion events all lining up to take place all waiting for my approval i felt sorry for you when you were a little girl said the iceman i feel sorry for you now save your sympathy iceman she replied i would not trade places with you the iceman stared at a thin line on the floor about ten feet ahead of him and noted that it ran up the walls and across the ceiling in point of fact you couldnt trade places with me even if you wanted to he said she smiled again you refer to the force field if thats what it is it keeps me in but it also keeps you out she replied you and the others what others he asked dont be obtuse iceman said the oracle its unbecoming do you refer to the assassin chandler asked praed tropo perhaps said the oracle she turned to the blue devil you must leave us now praed tropo turned and joined his two blue devils on the far side of the door which immediately slid shut how long have you been a prisoner penelope what makes you think i am a prisoner can you leave this room eventually she said but not right now he said i am content not to leave right now he stared at her for a long moment youve changed ive grown said the oracle he shook his head youre scarcely human anymore look at me said the oracle turning around before him do i not appear like any other young woman other young women concentrate on what they are saying and hearing youre hours and days ahead of where everyone else is arent you our present is your past youre mouthing words that occurred to you before i arrived you are very perceptive iceman i am glad i brought you here i came of my own volition he replied if it happens to serve your purposes its just a coincidence you are free to think so she said suddenly she turned sharply to her left whats that all about asked the iceman your friend the whistler is on his way here she replied he arrived on hades three days ago hidden in the hold of a cargo ship and made his way out of the spaceport under cover of night it took him this long to find out where i am if i had stood where i was he would have been seen by one of my agents as he left quichancha and you think that just by turning your body hell get out of the city unobserved said the iceman skeptically there are an infinite number of futures iceman my freedom of action is limited but in every future in which i turned he leaves the city unobserved how can turning your body make a difference in what happens a hundred miles away i do not know the why of it only the truth of it the oracle replied serenely in a universe of cause and effect i am the cause and by my willpower and my actions i select the effect he stared at her and made no reply why do you look at me with such an odd expression on your face she asked because im surprised by me he shook his head by me explain please why bother you know what im going to say i know a million things you might say she replied i cannot consider all of them all right said the iceman im surprised by my reaction to you in what way the last time we were together you caused the death of someone i cared for very much he answered you caused her death and you crippled me and i thought i hated you i thought that if i ever met you again all i would want to do would be to put my hands around your throat and squeeze until you died but this is not the case no he said i hated a little girl who killed out of passion and jealousy but youre not that girl you have no passion left for all i know you dont possess any other human emotions either youre a force of nature nothing more he paused and sighed you cant hate a hurricane or an ion storm for being what they are and i find i cant hate you she stared at him curiously but made no reply that doesnt mean you shouldnt be stopped he continued when winds build up to hurricane velocity we dissipate them when an ion storm approaches a habitable planet we neutralize it you cannot stop me iceman she said with detached amusement surely you know that by now someone has already stopped you he replied or have you the ability to walk over to where i am standing i have not wanted it until now she said placidly and now that i want it i shall have it soon how did they ever confine you here in the first place i was very young and very naive said the oracle ill agree that you were young replied the iceman i find it difficult to believe that you were ever naive but it is true iceman she said i came here with the mock turtle we stopped to refuel on the way to a planet where i was to grow up shielded from all outside influence and learn to use my powers to their fullest extent she paused and then i made a mistake what was it i could foresee that the ship would fail to function if a minor gasket was not replaced and i let them overhear me telling that to the mock turtle he practically worshipped me if youll recall and he immediately insisted that their mechanics fix the flawed gasket when they found that it indeed was cracked they told us that because their ships worked on different principles it would take them some weeks to import the part and because my abilities were immature i could not see far enough into the future to know that the part would never come and i believed them and they imprisoned you here asked the iceman they explained that it was a protective device and indeed it is she replied for just as i cannot pass through the field neither can you she paused again as if the past were much more difficult to summon than the future by the next morning i realized that we were prisoners but since i had no interest in the mock turtle s world anyway and all my needs were provided for i decided that this was as good a place to mature and grow strong as any why did you help the blue devils stay out of the democracy he asked they cant mean any more to you than the mock turtle did they thought and probably still think that i am helping them in the hope that they will someday release me but in fact it was a chance to test my growing powers answered the oracle and i have no love for the democracy it was the democracy that took me away from my parents and tried to turn me into a laboratory animal that would perform on command and it was the democracy that sent scores of bounty hunters after me when i escaped no i have no love for the democracy at all she met the icemans gaze with her own and she seemed once again to be looking not at him but months and years past him i have plans for the democracy iceman i have interesting plans indeed and now you think youre ready to put them into effect asked the iceman i am an adult woman now i am no longer penelope bailey nor am i the mock turtles soothsayer i am the oracle and it is time for me to go abroad in the galaxy what happened to the mock turtle he died she said with an unconcerned shrug how why do you care im curious he answered i cant believe you couldnt have kept him alive if you wanted to she smiled once more a smile that should have been very attractive but which instead seemed cold and distant you are very perceptive iceman did you just get tired of being worshipped what god tires of being worshipped she replied how did he die he was only concerned with what i could do for his insignificant race it was all he talked about all he thought about all he cared for he kept urging me to escape and return to his home world with him eventually he grew very tiresome and and one day his heart stopped she concluded you made it stop of course you still do not understand iceman she said shaking her head sadly i do not cause things to happen i choose the future in which they have already happened he frowned that sounds like a contradiction why because things cant have already happened if youre looking into the future she seemed amused perhaps not in your future she replied but then you are just a man she raised her left hand above her head held it in place for perhaps five seconds then lowered it and what future did you choose just now he asked i am bringing about a confluence of futures this night she said any explanation would be beyond your understanding try me i prefer to use you iceman how it is time for me to leave my confinement she said you will play an essential part in that not if i can help it she chuckled in amusement but you cant help it iceman that is why you are here in this place at this moment the injun left the darkened vehicle about half a mile south of the oracles compound then began silently approaching the rocky overhang that he had pinpointed as the most likely means of ingress just before he reached the base of the rock he sensed another presence drawing his laser pistol the most silent of his weapons he crouched down and remained motionless peering into the darkness and listening intently he saw nothing heard nothing but couldnt shake the feeling that there was someone out here with him it could have been a blue devil of course but no blue devil would feel the need to be so silent unless he had already been spotted and they were after him and he knew that he was too good at his craft to have given himself away yet it had to be the whistler who had finally made his way to hades from one of the moons the injun realized that he needed his peripheral vision in this situation and so for the first time in days he removed his eyepatch it took him a moment to adjust to having a broader field of vision and renewed depth perception and so he remained where he was for another few minutes until he was certain that he wouldnt be disoriented by what he saw suddenly he felt that the mysterious presence was no longer in his immediate vicinity and he climbed catlike to the top of the rocky overhang this afforded him a view of the far end of the compound where two armed blue devils guarded the driveway waiting to inspect or turn back any approaching vehicles he flattened himself out on top of the rock and spent another few minutes observing the yard and pinpointed the locations of three more guards he peered into the shadows cast by outbuildings and monuments trying to spot the whistler but couldnt find him finally he crawled to the edge of the overhang it was only eight or nine feet above one of the metal beams that supported the quartz roof and he gently lowered himself down until his feet were only twenty inches above it then he released his grip and landed lightly on the beam he walked along the beam until the shadow of the overhang hid him from any blue devil who chanced to look up then pulled a cloth out of his pocket and wiped off his hands and face which had become covered by sweat from his efforts in the warm hades night when he was finished he tucked the cloth back into his pocket he didnt want to walk across the quartz because he didnt know how much weight it would hold so he continued walking down the beam until he came to an acute angle that meant he had reached either the end of the roof or at least the end of this particular level of it he lowered himself to his belly and leaned his head over the side looking for a window and saw one far larger than a typical door about five feet below him and twelve feet to his right he pulled himself along the beam until he was directly above it he was now some thirty feet above the ground and he carefully lowered himself until his feet could touch the window it had looked hinged to him and he tried putting some gentle pressure against it it resisted for a moment then swung inward he waited to see if anyone inside the darkened room would walk to the window to see what had happened when no one appeared after twenty seconds he released his grip on the beam landed lightly on the window ledge and jumped into the room almost in one single motion then closed the window behind him the room was shaped like an equilateral triangle some fifteen feet on a side and perhaps ten feet high it was totally devoid of furnishings and served no purpose that he could determine there were two roughhewn wooden posts in the middle of the room perhaps six feet high and five feet apart he inspected them briefly but their purpose remained totally incomprehensible to him he then turned his attention to the door it did not recede as he approached it nor could he find a handle or a computer lock on it finally he reached out and tentatively pushed against it and it slid up out of sight so quickly that he jumped back startled he drew his laser pistol once again prepared to incinerate anyone who happened to see the door open but when he stepped out into a corridor that widened and narrowed as pointlessly as had the street in the blue devils sector of quichancha he found that it was empty the door snapped shut behind him as he turned to his left and began walking only to come to a dead end before he passed any doors stairways or airlifts he turned back and retraced his steps walked past the room through which he had entered came to a corner turned right and finally came upon a ramp that led down to a lower level he walked down it cautiously then heard low voices up ahead and crouched down weapon at the ready the voices were speaking in one of the guttural blue devil dialects and when they neither approached nor vanished after he had waited for a full minute he began descending the ramp again he emerged in a large manywindowed room that was filled with alien furnishings there were holograms and paintings of scenes no sane mind could have imagined and chairs built not only for blue devils but also some for multijointed lodinites and elephantine beings whose physical attributes were beyond his ability to conceive a holoscreen in one corner showed a disconcerting pattern of flashing lights all in varying shades of gray which he decided would have an almost hypnotic effect on anyone who concentrated on it he heard footsteps approaching and ducked behind one of the oversized chairs a moment later a blue devil entered the room from the far side walked through it and left through a doorway off to the left the injun stood up looked at both doorways and finally decided to follow the blue devil at least it had some destination in mind and if it ran into any of its companions he would probably hear them exchanging greetings before he stumbled upon them he gave the blue devil a thirtysecond head start then passed through the doorway and entered a long winding corridor it passed a number of closed doors then terminated in another large room this one filled with computers and radios of alien design and manned by four more blue devils the injun knew he couldnt pass through it unobserved and while he felt no compunction about killing every blue devil in the room he doubted that he could do so before one of them got off an alarm or distress signal so he retraced his steps until he came to the room where he had seen the blue devil and walked through the other doorway it looked like it was going to deadend against a large yellow wall but just as he was about to turn back he saw an extremely narrow stairwell off to his right on the assumption that anyone as valuable as the oracle wouldnt be kept on the ground level he opted for climbing up rather than down he ascended the stairs found himself on a large irregularly shaped landing and was trying to figure out what to do next when the smell of foodhuman foodwafted down a corridor he followed the odor and came to a small kitchen where a blue devil was preparing a steak of mutated beef and a small salad he crouched in the shadows of the adjacent room and waited after a few minutes a blue devil entered the kitchen passing within four feet of him uttered a terse command and left the blue devil who was preparing the food walked to a glowing sphere hovering near the wall said something into it and shortly thereafter another blue devil this one unarmed entered the kitchen through another door put the food on a tray and left the injun realized that he would have to pass through the kitchen if he was to follow the blue devil with the tray he stood up entered the kitchen coughed once to get the chef s attention and trained his laser pistol on it not a move not a sound said the injun in a low voice the blue devil stared at him and remained motionless where is the oracle asked the injun the blue devil made no answer you heard mewhere do you keep her the blue devil said something unintelligible oh shit muttered the injun dont tell me you cant speak terran the blue devil spoke again and again the injun couldnt understand a word of it he looked around saw what appeared to be a halfopened storage closet and still pointing his weapon at the blue devil he walked over to it and opened it in here he said gesturing the blue devil to enter the closet the blue devil looked at him uncomprehendingly i havent got any time to waste now move the blue devil remained motionless and the injun reached out and grabbed it by the arm it immediately reached out for his throat with its other hand the injun planted a kick against the blue devil s major leg joint then brought his pistol crashing down on the creatures skull it collapsed in a heap and not bothering to check whether it was alive or dead he dragged it over to the storage closet and crammed it in after which he closed the door there was a computer lock on the door and he turned his laser pistol on it intending to burn out the locks memory but when he pulled the trigger no beam came forth he examined the pistol found that the blow he had struck the blue devil had broken the connection to the power pack and placed it in a drawer then realizing that he was almost a full minute behind the tray carrier he raced out the far door after it the corridor in which he found himself was relatively straight and it soon broadened out and became almost as wide as a room finally it turned sharply and as he stuck his head around the corner he saw five armed blue devils guarding a large door that s got to be it he muttered he waited a minute then another to see if the blue devil with the tray emerged from the room that was being guarded but it didnt appear of course he reasoned it could simply have turned the tray over to one of the guards and left by another route there were a number of corridors leading off to both the right and the left and there was no way he could reconstruct what had happened it was even possible that these blue devils were guarding something other than the oracle and that the one he had followed was still carrying her food to her but he doubted it besides if that was the case he was going to have to take all five guards out before he could continue his quest but they hadnt guarded anything else in this crazily constructed house not even their communication center and it seemed likely that nothing but the oracle could command so much attention from armed guards the injun realized with an enormous surge of eagerness that it was time to put his strategy to the test he withdrew his sonic pistol and deactivated the safety then with his free hand he reached into his pocket pulled out the alphanella seeds that he had ordered broussard to confiscate back in quichancha carefully placed them between his teeth and bit down hard they are within the compound announced the oracle peering sightlessly off into space both of them asked the iceman yes she turned to him and smiled everything is coming to fruition i take it that im part of the plan in some eventualities you are in others you are not what do you think im going to do she looked amused in none of the futures i can see do i answer that question he pulled out a small cigar do you mind if i smoke yes i do tough he said lighting it there she said still amused youve stood up to me do you feel better now iceman not especially but you do not fear me not especially you should you know the iceman shrugged perhaps do you know that in all my life there is only one man i have ever been afraid of oh who was that you im flattered that was a long time ago said the oracle i see you now and i feel no fear she stared at him her eyes finally focused in the present my only reaction to you is contempt not hatred he asked she shook her head one must feel some respect to feel hatred if not respect for the person then at least respect for the harm he can cause and you consider me harmless yes she paused then spoke again even with the explosives you have hidden inside your artificial leg i consider you harmless you know about them i know everything she replied am i not the oracle youre an oracle imprisoned in a force field said the iceman how can you stop me if i decide to detonate the explosives right now you are an old man iceman and your heart has undergone many strains during your life if you try to detonate the explosives you will feel a searing pain in your chest your heart will burst and you will die she stared intently at him already it beats more rapidly already it pumps your blood at a dangerous rate in a million times a million futures you will not even be aware of it but she added stepping two paces to her right if i move here there exists a future in which you feel a warning pain does there not the iceman felt a sharp pain in his chest breathing suddenly became difficult and he experienced an overwhelming sensation of pressure he tried to conceal his reaction but was unable to you see she said with a satisfied smile there is one future among the billions in which you detonate the explosives successfully in which your pain does not cease it becomes unbearable and in that future just before you die you realize that what i have told you is the truth the pain finally began subsiding and the color returned to the icemans face he took a deep breath and leaned against the door for support can i ask you a question he said after a moment that is what the oracle does she answers questions how the hell have they managed to keep you locked up here why hasnt your jailor suffered a heart attack or a stroke at the proper moment they have chosen my keepers very carefully she answered in no future that i have been able to envision have any of them suffered from any pain or disease to the extent that it would allow me my freedom how do they feed you asked the iceman surely they have to dampen at least a portion of the field for that a tiny portion she replied you shall see in just a moment she raised her voice you may enter a blue devil bearing a tray of food walked through the doorway set it down on the floor right next to the force field and then exited a moment later a musical note sounded on the intercom system and penelope backed up against a wall as far from the tray as possible there was a sound of static as a portion of the field no more than a foot square dampened at floor level and she walked forward knelt down reached for the tray very gingerly and carefully pulled it to her the moment it was across the dividing line on the floor there was more static and a prerecorded blue devil voice informed them that the field was once again impregnable she carried the tray to a table and set it down there you see she asked and you havent had a living thing on your side of the field for how many years since the mock turtles unhappy demise youve had no human contact in all that time ive had no contact of any kind she paused well that s not entirely true i had a doll once but it fell apart four years ago the iceman tried to picture an eighteenyearold oracle playing with a doll and couldnt but he had no difficulty envisioning a lonely eighteenyearold penelope bailey hugging the doll to her for comfort i still feel sorry for you penelope he said its not your fault you were blessed or cursed with this ability and its not your fault that the democracy didnt know how to handle you and its probably not even your fault that the blue devils have confined you here for all these years but you are what you are and you cant be allowed out of here if you cant be killed you have to be contained dream your dreams of heroism iceman she replied what harm can they do suddenly she turned and faced the wall behind her and stood perfectly rigid for a moment then she turned back to him who were you helping that time asked the iceman no one you know she replied tonight is all but resolved i have other concerns to look after her placidity vanished to be replaced by a contemptuous frown fool she said does he think that will affect my ability to deal with him what are you talking about asked the iceman jimmy two feathers where is he he approaches and he thinks to befuddle me by befuddling himself she turned to the iceman his mind is gone but i do not read minds i see futures he bit into a seed asked the iceman as if it matters it matters said the iceman if he doesnt know what hes going to do next i will know snapped the oracle i thought you saw a myriad of futures and manipulated things to achieve the one you wanted how can you manipulate a man who currently has the intelligence of an insect thats why you are here iceman she said me if i cant stop him you will youve got a healthy imagination penelope i do not imagine things iceman replied the oracle i foresee them well youve foreseen this one wrong said the iceman if he can kill you i wont lift a finger to stop him you will do what you are destined to do the iceman was about to reply when the door opened and the injun wildeyed and disheveled burst into the room he held a sonic pistol in one hand and a knife dripping with blood in the other who are you he demanded of the iceman in a strained hollow voice im a friend replied the iceman the injun stared at him uncomprehending we both work for continued the iceman that bastard screamed the injun first i kill her then him keep your voice down the injun giggled why i killed all the blue devils out in the hall the iceman glanced at the oracle who was looking at the injun with an amused smile on her face youre not worried he thought hes standing right in front of you out of his goddamned mind and planning to kill you and you think its funny hes not the one the injun turned to face the oracle what are you grinning about lady he mumbled you think im kidding no jimmy two feathers she replied serenely i know youre not kidding he raised his pistol and sighted it between her eyes then lowered it im thirsty he announced theres water on the main level said the oracle theres water on the table right next to you said the injun he began approaching her dont shouted the iceman but it was too late the injun hit the force field shrieked once and bounced back off of it like a rubber ball he pounded into the wall spun off it and fell in a crumpled heap at the icemans feet the iceman knelt down next to him and felt for a pulse it was still racing at almost twice the normal rate what was that all about asked the iceman looking up at the oracle i dont understand you she replied why did you let him get all the way to this room and kill those blue devils only to wind up like this they were just blue devils she said with an unconcerned shrug i thought you needed him to get you out of here persisted the iceman i was mistaken too easy penelope you knew hed come in here and you knew he couldnt kill you this is still going according to plan but what the hell kind of a plan requires a madman to be lying unconscious at my feet you look confused iceman she said and again he could see amusement and something more condescension in her pale blue eyes i am he admitted but ill figure it out if you live long enough the same might be said for you he retorted she smiled i like living iceman i just might live forever i have no objection said the iceman as long as you stay on your side of the force field she stared at him a puzzled expression on her face i wonder what do you wonder i was born in the democracy and you on the inner frontier i am twentytwo years old and you are in your sixties i know nothing of your past and you know nothing of my future we have nothing in common except our enmity the odds of two people like ourselves meeting even once during our lifetimes are almost incalculable she paused why should our lives have become so interconnected i wonder i dont know admitted the iceman it is curious is it not she mused id have been just as happy never to know you existed happiness is not for you and me iceman she replied and as for knowing i exist soon more people than you can imagine shall know it not if i can help it ah but you cant she said with another tranquil smile all you can do is stand here helplessly and await what must happen next he offered no reply and they stared at each other in silence step aside iceman she said at last youre blocking the door he turned and saw praed tropo weaponless standing in the doorway then the blue devil was pushed into the room and chandler walked in right behind him a small pistol pressed against its back mendoza exclaimed chandler surprised what the hell are you doing here ill explain in a minute said the iceman are there any blue devils after you chandler shook his head there are corpses all over the place was that your doing his said the iceman indicating the stillunconscious body of the injun whos he jimmy two feathers the whistler frowned the injun what the hell is he doing on hades he was hired to kill the oracle well it doesnt look like hes going to be much competition he shoved praed tropo a few feet ahead of him then commanded the door to close whats he here for asked the iceman gesturing toward the blue devil he was examining the bodies when i showed up on this level answered chandler i figured i might need a shield so i suggested that he accompany me he turned to the oracle is she who you thought shed be shes penelope bailey yes answered the iceman whats that line on the floor a force field yes how did you know i knew they were keeping her prisoner answered chandler i didnt know how until just now from what they tell me force fields are still beyond our technology but nobody seems to want to cross that line he paused is that what happened to the injun the iceman nodded hes hopped up on alphanella seeds and he walked right into it well he cleared a path for me right to the door said chandler youd have managed if youd had to i doubt it said chandler i dont know what direction he approached them from but the way i came id have been a sitting duck he paused you still havent told me why youre here new orders said the iceman oh can you kill her i dont see why not answered chandler but if youre worried about the force field i saw one hell of a big generator two levels down from this one if its powering the field i think i can deactivate it the iceman looked at the oracle who was once again staring off into time and space you dont even know how it works he said i dont know how the force field works answered chandler but i know how the generator works there was one very similar to it in a kobolian ship i owned once praed tropo had carefully backed a few steps away from chandler and finally the iceman turned to it stop right there he said i dont want to kill you but i will if i have to the blue devil halted then slowly retreated until he was standing next to chandler again lets do whatever it is we have to do said chandler those bodies arent going to stay undiscovered forever or even for very long interjected the oracle with no show of concern well said chandler im still piecing it together said the iceman i thought i had it but why did you need praed tropo here mendoza we havent got all night said chandler impatiently just give me a minute snapped the iceman he turned to stare at the oracle all right hes the only one who can release you and you needed the injun to pave the way for him but why me and why praed tropo she smiled enigmatically at him but made no reply she couldnt have planned all of this said chandler even if she planned for the injun to chew his seeds how could she plan what hed do once hed sizzled his brain she doesnt plan things explained the iceman she selects them she selected a future in which the four of us were in this room at this time but i still dont know why she there was a sudden movement from praed tropo and chandler who had been concentrating on the oracle cursed and clutched at his right arm which was gushing blood from where his nearly severed hand was hanging uselessly kill that sonofabitch snarled chandler as praed tropo turned to face the iceman with a knife that he had somehow concealed beneath his tunic freeze said the iceman drawing his own weapon and training it on the blue devil praed tropo hesitated for an instant then stood motionless drop it continued the iceman as chandler knelt down and tried to staunch the flow of blood he dared a quick glance at the oracle who was watching the proceedings with an almost unnatural calm youre not surprised in the least you knew this was going to happen he frowned as he turned his attention back to praed tropo but it doesnt make any sense you got the two best killers in the galaxy here and one of thems half dead and now the others crippled why chandler had ripped part of his tunic off and was wrapping it around his hand cursing under his breath all the while all right hes not dead you want him alive but ineffective why what am i missing give me another minute and ill kill him myself grated chandler working on his hand kill muttered a hollow voice behind the iceman kill the iceman took a step back then another and saw the injun rise groggily to his knees kill he repeated as if the word had lost all meaning to him his pupils were dilated his expression wild stay where you are jimmy said the iceman kill mumbled the injun rising unsteadily to his feet were your friends said the iceman trying without success to make his voice soothing and reassuring i have no friends whispered the injun i dont know you suddenly his gaze fell on chandler i know him though he wants to rob me of my commission he reached for his sonic pistol well you cant do it chandler he yelled i was here first shes mine his fingers closed on the hilt of the pistol and he began raising his hand to aim the weapon at chandler it isnt fair he growled slurring the words i wont let you rob me the iceman pointed his gun at the injun hold it right there or youre a dead man he said ominously shes mine damn it said the injun as tears began to stream down his face i found her not you i killed all those blue devils out in the hall not you you cant cheat me out of whats mine the injun swaying dizzily aimed his gun unsteadily at chandler as the icemans finger began closing on his own trigger and then the final piece fell into place the iceman couldnt stop from firing his weapon but at the very last microsecond he jerked his hand and the beam went harmlessly into a wall as the injun shot chandler no cried the oracle as chandler pitched forward facedown on the floor the iceman then trained his pistol between the injuns eyes and fired again he then turned to praed tropo be quiet and dont do anything foolish he said and you just might live through this he paused i was right wasnt i penelope she nodded her head you had a lot of futures to put together didnt you continued the iceman you needed the whistler because only he knew enough about the generator to deactivate it but the injun had to arrive first because there werent any futures in which the whistler could approach this room unseen yes she said if i hadnt figured it out what would have happened id have killed the injun to save chandler i assume that was my function and then praed tropo would have killed me she nodded her eyes already distant examining still more futures but im a fat old man with a limp continued the iceman i could never have gotten away from here thats what i couldnt understand why praed tropo had to be in the room with us why he or some other lorhn couldnt just pick me up later i do not comprehend said the blue devil the iceman turned to it you had to disable chandler without killing him he was the most dangerous of us all even without the use of his hand hed have found a way to kill you but hed have known that he couldnt fight his way out not against whole squadrons of you so his only option would have been to release penelope and have her pick and choose futures in which the two of them escaped he looked at the oracle again and once you were safely away from here and he thought he was taking you to to pick up the rest of his money hed have had a heart attack am i right a stroke she replied placidly his heart was in superb condition praed tropo said the iceman do you understand what happened now all of this he continued gesturing to the bodies of chandler and the injun everything that happened here came about because she wanted to escape thats why im here thats why youre here were not enemies you and i were her pawns nothing more the blue devil stared at him but made no comment we cant let her out not now not ever its a cruel twist of fate that made her what she is and its a dismal future shes facing but shes too dangerous ever to turn loose on the galaxy look what she was able to accomplish while you kept her imprisoned no said praed tropo at last she can never be released youre a reasonable being praed tropo but others will come after her they will be sent to kill her but she will manipulate them as she manipulated us and next time she may succeed ill see to it that there wont be any next time answered the iceman how can you do this ill tell that shes dead if you keep her incommunicado hell have no reason to ever suspect that i lied to him that presupposes that i will let you leave noted praed tropo you have no reason to keep me here said the iceman and if you try i have an explosive device on my person that i wont hesitate to detonate it will blow you and me and this whole damned compound to hell but shell find some way to survive he paused id much rather live wouldnt you praed tropo stared at him for a long moment you may go in peace it said at last thank you you cannot leave the grounds without being apprehended it continued i will arrange for an escort it walked to the door and then turned to him do not leave the room until i return or i cannot be responsible for your safety i understand said the iceman as the blue devil began walking away i was wrong said the oracle when the two of them were alone i thought i was ready to go out into the galaxy but i was mistaken i shall have to wait until my powers mature still more youll never leave this room penelope she smiled on the day that im ready i will you underestimated me when i was a little girl tonight i underestimated you i think neither of us will make that particular mistake again she sighed and shook her head i should have seen it but there were so many permutations what the injun would do and when where chandler would stand when praed tropo would act when the injun would awaken suddenly she smiled still i came very close another halfsecond and id have had it yes you would have admitted the iceman next time ill be more accurate there wont be any next time perhaps not for you she said serenely youre a usedup old man and your strength is gone she paused but im still young every day i grow more powerful and there is a whole galaxy out there leave it alone said the iceman she smiled at him i cant you know i look ahead and i see great things things you cant even begin to imagine one day i will have to walk out of here and accomplish them praed tropo returned with a squad of six blue devils are you ready mendoza it asked the iceman nodded and turned to join them iceman she called after him yes i want to thank you for what he asked puzzled for surprising me she said one should always seek out new expenences and i have never been surprised before i hope you enjoyed it he said sardonically no she replied thoughtfully no i didnt i do not intend ever to be surprised again her words seemed to hang in the air like an ominous cloud as the iceman left the room
