roots and a few vines by mike resnick so im sitting there in winnipeg resplendent in my tuxedo and morbidly wondering how many fans have called me mr resnick instead of mike since the worldcon began three days ago i dont feel like a mister i feel like a fan who is cheating by sitting here with all the pros waiting for bob silverberg to announce the winner of the best editor hugo he goes through the names datlow dozois resnick rusch schmidt he opens the envelope and reads off kris ruschs name and suddenly i am walking up to the stage bob is sure i thought he called out my name and looks like he is considering clutching the hugo to his breast and running off with it although that is actually a response common to all pros when they are in proximity to a hugo but finally he sighs and hands it over to me and i start thanking ed ferman and all the voters what am i doing here i wonder picking up a hugo for a lady who is half my age and has twice my talent and is dropdead gorgeous to boot how in blazes did i ever get to be an elder statesman well it began in which oddly enough was not just last year no matter how it feels carol and i had met at the university of chicago in wed gone to the theater on our first date and wound up in the morrison hotels coffee shop where we talked science fiction until they threw us out at in the morning it was the first time either of us realized that someone else out there read that crazy buck rogers stuff though we might have guessed since they continued to print it month after month and two sales per title would hardly seem enough to keep the publishers in business well rolls around and so does a future campbell winner named laura but the second biggest event of the year comes when ace books under the editorship of don wollheim starts pirating a bunch of edgar rice burroughs novels and a whole generation gets to learn about tarzan and frank frazetta and john carter and roy krenkal and david innes all at once but the important thing the thing that unquestionably shaped my adult life was that one of the books had a little blurb on the inside front cover extolling erbs virtues and it was signed camille cazedessus editor of erbdom well you didnt have to be a genius to figure out that erbdom at least in that context was an obvious reference to edgar rice burroughs a whole magazine devoted to one of my favorite writers i could barely wait until the next morning when i took the subway downtown and entered the post office news chicagos largest magazine store i looked for erbdom next to time life look newsweek and playboy wasnt there i looked for it next to analog galaxy and f sf no dice wasnt anywhere near forbes or fortune or business week either so i go up to the manager and tell him im looking for erb dom and he checks his catalogs and tells me there aint no such animal i grab him by the arm drag him over to the paperbacks pull out the operative burroughs title turn to the inside front cover and smite him with a mighty aha so he promises to get cracking and find out who publishes this magazine and start stocking it and i return to our subterranean penthouse to await the good news which doesnt come i nag post office news incessantly i nag my local bookstore i nag the public library i even nag my mother this seems counterproductive but she has been nagging me for years and fair is fair finally i look at my watch and it is halfpast and there is still no sign of erbdom so i write to the editor miss cazedessus so okay until then id never heard of a guy named camille in care of ace books and a month later the first five issues of erbdom arrive in the mail the very first fanzines i have ever seen along with a long friendly letter that constantly uses the arcane word worldcon within two months i have written three long articles for erbdom and have become its associate editor there is a worldcon in chicago that summer not a minute subway ride from where we live but the future campbell winner chooses august to get herself born and we do not go to the worldcon when she is days old i decide to forgive her and lovingly show her off to her grandparents and she vomits down the back of my hawaiian shirt and it is years before i willingly touch her again but that is another story there is one other thing that happens in we are living at the corner of north shore and greenview in the rogers park area of chicago and right across street of us is this old apartment building and on the third saturday of every month strangelooking men and women congregate there they have long hair and most of them are either pounds overweight or pounds underweight and often they are carrying books under their arms we decide they are members of sncc or core which are pretty popular organizations at the time and that they are meeting there to figure out how to dodge the draft and that the books they carry are either pacifist tracts or ledgers with the names and addresses of all the left wing groups that have contributed money to them we have to go all the way to washington dc a year later and attend discon i to find out that they are not draft dodgers well not primarily anyway but rather chicago fandom and that they have been meeting feet from our front door for years so i wend my way back through the audience and i find my seat and i hand kris ruschs hugo to carol because i am also up for best short story and i think ive got a better chance at this and when i run up to accept the award it will look tacky to already be carrying a hugo besides charles sheffield is sitting right next to us and he is up for best novelette and he is getting very nervous and wants to stroke the hugo for luck or maybe is considering just walking out with it and changing the name plates at a future date in fact i am convinced that if he does not win his own neither kris nor i will ever see her hugo again charles will probably deny this but never forget that charles gets paid an inordinate amount of money to tell lies to the public at large so guy gavriel kay begins reading off the nominees and suddenly i realize that i am not nervous at all that this is becoming very old hat to me i have been nominated for nine hugos in the past six years i have actually won a pair worldcons are very orderly things you show up you sign a million autographs you eat each meal with a different editor and line up your next years worth of work and then you climb into your tux and see if you won another hugo its gotten to be such a regular annual routine you sometimes find yourself idly wondering was it always like this then you think back to your first worldcon and you realize that no it was not always like this right off the bat we were the victims of false doctrine everyone we knew in fandom all six or seven of them told us the worldcon was held over labor day weekend so we took them at their word the problem of course was the definition of weekend we took a train that pulled out of chicago on friday morning and dumped us in the basement of our washington dc hotel at saturday morning at which time we found out that the convention was already half over things were different then there were no times in the convention listings in fact there were no convention listings not in analog not anywhere if you knew that worldcons even existed you were already halfway to being a trufan caz met us and showed us around like myself he was dressed in a suit and tie it was a few more worldcons before men wore shirts without jackets or ties even during the afternoons and every woman they formed at most of the attendees and over half were writers wives wore a skirt if you saw someone with a beard a relatively rare occurrence you knew he was either a pro writer or bruce pelz when we got to the huckster room plus dealers and selling only books magazines and fanzines none of the junk that dominates the tables today i thought i had died and gone to heaven the art show had work by finlay and freas and emsh and even margaret brundage only j allen st john was missing from among the handful of artists whose work i knew and admired they had an auction it even had a little booklet telling you what items would be auctioned when so you knew which session to attend to get what you wanted stan vinson a famous burroughs collector who had been corresponding with me for a year bought a frazetta cover painting for friends told him he was crazy paintings were supposed to appreciate and no one would ever pay that much for a frazetta again i bought a finlay sketch for and an autographed sturgeon manuscript for in the afternoon we decide to go to the panels i do not know from panels like any neo i take along a pencil and a notebook the panels are not what we have these days or at least they did not seem so to my untrained and wondrous eyes and ears for example there is a panel with willy ley and isaac asimov and fritz leiber and l sprague de camp and ed emsh and leigh bracket and the topic is what should a bem look like i have a copy of the discon proceedings a transcript of the entire convention published by advent and to this day when i need a new alien race i reread that panel and invariably i come up with one there was a panel with fred pohl and a tyro named budrys and a gorgeous editor though not as gorgeous as the one i accepted a hugo for named cele goldsmith and even john campbell himself on how to write stories around cover paintings which was a common practice back then and which remains fascinating reading today there was a sweet old guy in a white suit who saw that we were new to all this and moseyed over and spent half an hour with us making us feel at home and telling us about how we were all one big family and inviting us to come to all the parties at night then he wandered off to accept the firstever hall of fame award from first fandom when they asked if he was working on anything at present he replied that he had just delivered the manuscript to skylark duquesne and received the secondbiggest ovation i have ever heard at a worldcon the biggest came years later when andy porter broke a year losing streak and won the semiprozine hugo in since we didnt know anyone and were really rather shy over the years i have learned to overcompensate for this tendency as almost anyone will tell you bitterly and at length we ate dinner alone then watched the masquerade which in those days was truly a masquerade ball and not a competition there was a band and everyone danced and a few people showed up in costume and every now and then one of them would march across the stage and at the end of the ball they announced the winners then there was the bheer blast in those bygone days they didnt show movies i think movies turned up in not to display the hugo nominees or give pleasure to the cinema buffs but to give the kids a place to sleep so theyd stop cluttering up the lobby they didnt give out the hugos at night either an evening banquet might run a head and the concom got enough grief for charging a head for rubber chicken served at pm rather than six hours later they didnt have more than one track of programming multiple tracks came along years later and evening programs even later than that well with all the things they didnt have they needed a way to amuse the congoers in the evening so what happened was this every bid committee and they only bid a year in advance back then treated the entire convention to a beer party on a different night we could all fit in one room i know the official tally for discon i was but i was there and ill swear that there were no more than or so in attendance the other must have been noshows or waiters or bellboys and the bidding committee would treat us to a small lakeful of beer with or without pretzels and then the next night a rival bid would do the same thing you voted if you could drag yourself out of bed on sunday morning at the business meeting a fan would speak for each bid telling you how wonderful his committee was then a pro would speak for each bid telling you about the quality of restaurants you would encounter the better restaurants invariably carried the day after the beer blast was over everyone vanished the burroughs people all of them straighter than tarzans arrows went to bed we remembered that doc smith had mentioned parties so we began wandering down the empty foreboding corridors of the hotel wondering if the parties really did exist and how to find them we walked all the way down one floor took the stairs up a flight repeated the procedure then did it again we were about to quit when a door opened and a little bearded man and a thin balding man both with thick glasses spotted our name badges and asked if wed like to come in for a drink we didnt know who the hell they were but they had badges too so we knew they were with the con and probably not about to mug a couple of innocents from chicago and we decided to join them turns out they were standing in the doorway to a huge suite and that their names were del rey and blish inside wearing a bowtie and looking not unlike a penguin in his black suit was isaac asimov randy garrett was dressed in something allsatin and not of this century bob silverberg looked young and incredibly dapper sam moskowitz was speaking to ed hamilton and leigh brackett in a corner this was many years before his throat surgery and it was entirely possible though unlikely that no one in the basement could hear him and every last one of them went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel at home later another young fan wandered in much younger than me i was jack chalker was only we sat around and discussed various things and then something strange happened something totally alien to my experience someone asked jack and i what we wanted to do with our lives we each answered that we wanted to write science fiction and you know what for the first time in my life nobody laughed thats when i knew i was going to come back to worldcons for the rest of my life so guy gavriel kay reads off the list of nominees and then he opens the envelope and the winner is connie willis and i am second to her again for the rd time yeah i know ive only lost hugos and nebulas to her but it feels like and everyone tells me ive won a moral victory because i have beat all the short stories and connies winner is a novelette that david bratman in his infinite wisdom decided to move to the short story category and i keep thinking that moral victories and cents will get you a cup of coffee anywhere west of new york and east of california and that i wish i didnt like connie so much so that i could hate her just a little on labor day weekends and my brain is making up slogans modified slightly from my youth slogans like break up connie willis which is certainly easier than breaking up the yankees and i am wondering if tanya harding will loan me her bodyguard for a few days and then i am at the hugo losers party and suddenly it doesnt matter that ive lost a hugo because it is now years since that first worldcon i went to and it is my annual family reunion and i am visiting with friends that i see once or twice or on good years five times per year and we have a sense of continuity and community that goes back for almost twothirds of my life hugos are very nice and i am proud of the ones ive won and i am even proud of the ones ive lost but when all is said and done they are metal objects and my friends are people and people are what life is all about and i find to my surprise that almost everyone i am talking to almost all the old friends i am hugging and already planning to see again at the next worldcon are fans some like me write for a living a few paint most do other things but we share a common fannish history and a common fannish language and common fannish interests and i realize that i even enjoyed the business meeting this year and you have to be pretty far gone into fandom to enjoy ben yalow making a point of order a lot of pros dont go to worldcon anymore they prefer world fantasy con its smaller more intimate and its limited to members and while this is not official there is nonetheless a fans not wanted sign on the door thats probably why i dont go its true that worldcons have changed that people who read and write science fiction are probably a minority special interest group these days that bad movies will outdraw the hugo ceremony but the trufans are there it just means you have to work a little harder to hunt them up one of the things i have tried to do with the new writers i have helped to bring into this field the coming superstars like nick dichario and barb delaplace and michelle sagara and jack nimersheim and all the many others is to not only show them how to make a good story better or to get an editor to pick up the check for meals but also to understand the complex and symbiotic relationship between fandom and prodom some of them like nick luck out and find it right away some like barb wander into a bunch of trekkies or wookies or beasties who wont read anything except novelizations who are watchers rather than readers whose only literary goal is to tell secondhand stories in a thirdhand universe and she wonders what the hell im talking about then i drag her to a cfg suite or a nesfa party and she meets the fandom i know and suddenly she understands why we keep coming back so im sitting in the airport waiting to board the plane from winnipeg to minnesota i think there are three mundanes on the flight everyone else is coming from worldcon larry nivens there and connie willis and maybe a dozen other pros and one of the topics of conversation as we await the plane is whose names will make the cover of locus if the plane crashes and whose names will be in small print on page and how many obituary issues charlie brown can get out of it then the topic turns to who you would rescue if the plane crashed connie and larry and me because you wanted more of our stories or scott edelman and me because you wanted us to be so grateful to you that wed buy your next twenty stories that goes to show you the advantages of being able to do more than one thing well now in any other group that would be a hell of a morbid discussion but because they were fans and almost by definition bright and witty it was the most delightful conversation id heard all weekend and once again i found myself wondering what my life would have been like if ace had not forwarded that letter to caz years ago and then i thought back to another convention the worldcon i was still very young and too cynical by half and when lester del rey got up to give his guest of honor speech he looked out at the tables every worldcon until presented the goh speech and the hugo awards at a banquet and said every person in the world that i care for is here tonight and i thought what a feeble thing to say what a narrow narrow life this man has lived what a tiny circle of friends he has well ive sold books of science fiction novels collections anthologies and ive won some awards and ive paid some dues and i dont think its totally unrealistic to assume that sometime before i die i will be the guest of honor at a worldcon ive done a lot with my life all with carols help to be sure ive taken several trips to africa ive bred champion collies ive owned and run the secondbiggest boarding kennel in the country ive sired a daughter than any father would be proud to call his own ive been a lot of places done a lot of things i dont think ive led a narrow life at all but when i get up to make my guest of honor speech ill look around the room just the way lester did and because im a reasonably honest man i wont say what he said but i will say with three or four exceptions every person in the world that i care for is here tonight
