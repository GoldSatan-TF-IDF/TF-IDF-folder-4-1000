three sisters island september she called the storm the gales of wind the bolts of lightning the rage of the sea that was both prison and protection she called the forces those that lived within her those that dwelled without the bright and the dark slender with her cloak streaming back like birdwings she stood alone on the windwhipped beach alone but for her rage and her grief and her power it was that power that filled her now rushed inside her in wild pounding strokes like a lover gone mad and so perhaps it was she had left husband and children to come to this place left them under a spellsleep that would keep them safe and unaware once she had done what she had come to do she could never go back to them she would never again hold their muchloved faces in her hands her husband would grieve for her and her children weep but she could not go back to them and she could not would not turn from the path she had chosen payment must be made and justice however rough would be met at last she stood arms outflung in the tempest she had conjured her hair flew free and wild dark ribbons that slashed at the night like whips you must not do this thing a woman appeared beside her burning as bright in the storm as the fire after which she was named her face was pale her eyes dark with what might have been fear it is already begun stop it now sister stop before it is too late you have no right right she who was called earth whirled her eyes glowing fierce who has better right when they murdered the innocents in salem town persecuted and hunted and hanged we did nothing to stop it stop one flood cause another you know this we made this place fire stretched out her arms as if to encompass the island that rocked in the sea for our safety and our survival for our craft safety you can speak of safety of survival now our sister is dead and i grieve for her as you do pleading she crossed her hands between her breasts my heart weeps as yours weeps her children are in our keeping now will you abandon them as well as your own there was a madness in her tearing at her heart as the wind tore at her hair even recognizing it she could not defeat it he will not go unpunished he will not live while she does not if you cause harm youll have broken your vows you will have corrupted your power and what you send out in the night will come back to you threefold justice has a price not this never this your husband will lose a wife your children a mother and i another beloved sister more even more than that you break faith with what we are she would not have wanted this this would not have been her answer she died rather than protect herself died for what she is for what we are our sister abjured power for what she called love and it killed her her choice one that stayed bitter in the throat long after it was swallowed and still she harmed none do this thing use your gift in this dark way and you doom yourself you doom us all i cannot live hidden here there were tears in her eyes now and in the stormlight they burned red as blood i cannot turn from this my choice my destiny i take his life for hers and damn him for all time and calling for vengeance shooting it like a bright and deadly arrow from a bow she who was known as earth sacrificed her soul one three sisters island january sand frosted with cold crunched under her feet as she ran along the curving shore incoming waves left froth and bubbles lying on the crusted surface like tattered lace overhead the gulls called relentlessly her muscles had warmed and moved fluid as oiled gears in the second mile of her morning run her pace was a fast and disciplined jog and her breath rushed out in white plumes and rushed in sharp and cold as shards of ice she felt fabulous the wintry beach held no footprints but her own and hers were stamped new over old as she jogged back and forth across the gentle sweep of winter beach if shed chosen to do her three miles in one straight line she could have crossed three sisters from side to side at its widest point the idea of that always pleased her the little clump of land off the coast of massachusetts was hers every hill every street every cliff and inlet deputy ripley todd felt more than affection for three sisters its village its residents its wellbeing she felt responsibility she could see the rising sun glint against the windows of storefronts on high street in a couple of hours the shops would open people would walk along the streets going about the days business there wasnt much of a tourist trade in january but some would come over from the mainland on the ferry poke about in the shops drive up to the cliffs buy some fresh fish right off the docks for the most part though the winter was for islanders she loved the winter best at the end of the beach where it bumped the edge of the seawall just below the village she pivoted and headed back across the sand fishing boats plied an ocean that was the color of pale blue ice it would change as the light strengthened as the sky deepened it never failed to fascinate her how many colors water could hold she saw carl maceys boat and a figure tiny as a toy in the stern raised a hand she saluted back kept running with under three thousand islanders yearround it wasnt hard to know who was who she slowed her pace a bit not only to cool down but to prolong the solitude she often took her morning runs with her brothers dog lucy but this morning she had slipped out alone alone was another thing she liked best and shed wanted to clear her mind there was a great deal to think about some of which she preferred not to so she tucked those annoyances and problems away for now what had to be dealt with wasnt precisely a problem you couldnt call something that made you happy a problem her brother was just back from his honeymoon and nothing could have pleased her more than to see how happy he and nell were together after all theyd been through and what it had nearly cost seeing them cozied up together in the house where she and zack had grown up was pure satisfaction and over the past months since summer when nell had ended her flight from fear on the island theyd become real friends it was a pleasure to see the way nell had bloomed and toughened but all that mushy stuff aside ripley thought there was one little blight on the rose and its name was ripley karen todd newlyweds didnt need to share their love nest with the grooms sister she hadnt given the matter a thought before the wedding and even after when shed waved them both off for a week in bermuda she hadnt seen the whole picture but when theyd returned all snuggling and flushed with a honeymoon haze it couldnt have been more clear justmarrieds needed privacy they could hardly have hot spontaneous sex on the living room floor if she might stroll into the house any time of the day or night not that either of them had said anything about it but they wouldnt the pair of them might as well wear werenicepeople merit badges plastered on their chests and that ripley thought was something she would never be pinning on her own shirt she stopped used the outcropping of rocks at the far end of the beach for support as she stretched out calves hamstrings quadriceps her body was as lean and toned as a young tigers she took pride in it in her control over it as she bent from the waist the ski cap that shed tugged on fell to the sand and her hair the color of varnished oak tumbled free she wore it long because it didnt require regular trims and styling that way it was just another type of control her eyes were a sharp bottle green when she was in the mood she might fuss with mascara and eyeliner after considerable debate shed decided her eyes were the best part of a face made up of mismatched features and angular lines she had a slight overbite because shed despised her retainer and she had the wide forehead and nearly horizontal dark eyebrows of the ripley side of the family no one would have accused her of being pretty it was too soft a word and would have insulted her in any case she preferred knowing it was a strong and sexy face the kind that could attract men when she was in the mood for one which she hadnt been she mused for several months part of that was wedding plans holiday plans the time shed spent helping zack and nell unwind legal tangles so they could be married and another part she was forced to admit was her own sense of annoyance and unease that lingered from halloween when shed ripped open pockets in herself that she had purposely sewn shut years before couldnt be helped she thought now shed done what needed to be done and had no intention of a repeat performance no matter how many cool smirky glances mia devlin shot her way the thought of mia brought ripley back full circle mia had an empty cottage nell had rented it then moved out when she married zack as much as ripley hated the idea of having any sort of dealings even straight business with mia the yellow cottage was the perfect solution it was small private simple it just made sense ripley decided and started up the worn wooden steps that zagged from the beach toward the house it was irritating but it was practical still maybe it wouldnt hurt if she took a few days let the word out that she was looking for a place to rent something something that didnt belong to mia might drop in her lap cheered by the possibility ripley bounded up the steps jogged to the back porch nell would already be baking she knew just as she knew the kitchen would smell like heaven the biggest advantage was that she wouldnt have to hunt up breakfast it would just be there delicious delightful and on demand as she reached for the doorknob she saw through the glass zack and nell they were wrapped around each other she thought like ivy on a flagpole wrapped around each other and wrapped up in each other oh man hissing out a breath she backtracked then came back up on the porch stomping like a horse and whistling it would give them time to peel themselves off each other at least she hoped it would but it didnt solve her other problem she was going to have to deal with mia after all she was going to keep it casual to ripleys way of thinking if mia knew she really wanted the yellow cottage she would refuse to rent it the woman was so damn contrary of course the very best way to lock in the deal would be to ask nell to run interference mia had a soft spot for nell but the idea of using anyone to clear the path was galling she would just casually drop in at mias bookstore the way she had almost every day since nell had taken over the cooking and baking for the café section that way she could cop a righteous lunch and new digs all in one swipe she walked briskly along high street more because she wanted the business over and done than because the wind was up and blowing it tugged playfully at the long straight tail of hair that she habitually yanked through the opening in the back of her cap when she reached café book she paused pursed her lips mia had redone the display window a little tasseled footstool a soft throw of deep red and a pair of tall candlestands with fat red candles were arranged with seemingly haphazard piles of books because she knew mia never did anything in a haphazard fashion ripley had to admit the whole tone was one of homey warmth and welcome and subtly very subtly sexy its cold out the window announced come on in and buy some books to take home and snuggle up with whatever else ripley could say about mia and she could say plenty the woman knew her business she stepped inside into warmth automatically unwinding her neck scarf the deepblue shelves were lined with books parlortidy glass displays held pretty trinkets and intriguing dust catchers the fireplace was simmering with a low golden flame and another throw blue this time was tossed artfully over one of the deep sinkintome chairs yeah she thought mia knew her stuff there was more other shelves held candles of various shapes and sizes deep bowls were filled with tumbling stones and crystals colorful boxes of tarot cards and runes were tucked here and there all very subtle again ripley noted with a frown mia didnt advertise that the place was owned by a witch but she didnt hide it either ripley imagined the curiosity factor both tourist and local accounted for a healthy chunk of the stores annual profits none of her business from behind the big carved counter mias head clerk lulu finished ringing up a customers purchases then tipped down her silverframed glasses to peer at ripley over the top of them looking for something for your mind as well as your belly today no ive got plenty to occupy my mind read more know more ripley grinned i already know everything always thought you did anyway got a novelty book in this weeks shipment thats right up your alley pickup lines unisex lu ripley gave her a cocky grin as she strolled to the stairs leading to the shops second level i wrote the book lulu cackled havent seen you keeping company just recently she called out i havent felt like company just recently there were more books on the second floor and more browsers poking through them but here the café was the big draw already ripley could scent the soup of the day something rich and spicy the early crowd which would have snagged nells muffins and turnovers or whatever treat shed dreamed up for the day had shifted to the lunch crowd on a day like this ripley imagined theyd be looking for something hot and hearty before they treated themselves to one of nells sinful desserts she scanned the display and sighed cream puffs nobody in their right mind walked away from cream puffs even if the other choices were equally tempting éclairs tarts cookies and what looked to be a cake made up of many layers of pure gooey sin the artist behind the temptations rang up an order her eyes were a deep and clear blue her hair a short gold halo around a face that glowed with health and wellbeing dimples flashed in her cheeks as she smiled and waved her customer off to one of the café tables arranged by the window marriage ripley thought agreed with some people nell channing todd was one of them you look pretty bouncy today ripley commented feel great the days just flying by soup of the days minestrone sandwich is im just doing soup ripley interrupted because i need one of the cream puffs to ensure my happiness ill take coffee with it coming up im baking a ham for dinner tonight she added so no grabbing pizza before you come home yeah okay sure it reminded ripley of the second stage of business she shifted her feet gave the room another sweeping glance i didnt see mia around anywhere working in her office nell ladled up soup added a crusty roll baked fresh that morning i expect shell breeze through shortly you were in and out of the house so fast this morning i didnt get to talk to you something up no not up maybe it was rude to arrange for alternate living arrangements without saying something first ripley wondered if this fell into the area of social skills a tricky business for her will i be in your way if i chow down in the kitchen she asked nell that way i can talk to you while you work sure come on back nell carried the food over to her worktable are you sure nothings wrong not a thing ripley assured her bitchy cold out i bet you and zack are sorry you didnt stay south until spring the honeymoon was perfect even thinking of it brought on a warm satisfied glow but its better being home nell opened the refrigerator for the container holding one of the days salads everything i want is here zack family friends a home of my own a year ago id never have believed id be standing here like this knowing that in an hour or so id be going home you earned it i did nells eyes darkened and in them ripley could see the core of strength a core that everyone including nell had underestimated but i didnt do it alone the bright ding of the counter bell warned her she had a customer waiting dont let your soup get cold she slipped out her voice lifting in greeting ripley spooned up soup and sighed with contentment at the first taste she would just concentrate on her lunch and think about the rest later but shed barely made a dent in the bowl when she heard nell call mias name ripleys in the kitchen i think she wanted to see you shit shit shit ripley scowled into her soup and got busy filling her mouth well well make yourself at home mia devlin her gypsy mane of red hair tumbling over the shoulders of a long dress of forest green leaned gracefully against the doorjamb her face was a miracle formed of high iceedged cheekbones a full sculpted mouth painted as boldly red as her hair skin smooth as cream and eyes gray as witchsmoke those eyes looked ripley over lazily one brow lifted in a perfect and derisive arch i am ripley continued to eat i figure its nells kitchen this time of day if i thought otherwise id be searching my soup for wool of bat or dragons teeth and its so hard to come by dragons teeth this time of year what can i do for you deputy not a thing but i did give some passing thought to doing something for you now im all agog tall and slim she moved to the table and sat she was wearing those needlethin heels she was so fond of ripley noticed she could never figure out why anyone would put her innocent feet in such torture chambers without a gun being held to her head she broke off another piece of her roll munched you lost yourself a tenant when nell and zack tied the knot i figured you hadnt gotten around to doing anything about renting out the yellow cottage and since im thinking about getting my own place maybe i can help you out do tell intrigued mia broke off a bite of ripleys roll for herself hey im paying for that ignoring her mia nibbled a little too crowded for you at the homestead its a big house ripley gave a careless shrug then moved the rest of her roll out of reach but you happen to have one going empty its a pretty dinky place but i dont need much id be willing to negotiate a lease on it a lease on what nell swung back in straight to the fridge to get out the makings for a sandwich order the yellow cottage mia told her ripleys looking for a place of her own oh but nell turned you have a place of your own with us lets not make this sticky it was too late to regret she hadnt arranged to speak to mia privately i was just thinking itd be cool to have a little place to myself and since mias got one going begging on the contrary mia said smoothly neither i nor my possessions need to beg you dont want me to do you a favor ripley lifted a shoulder no skin off mine its so considerate of you to think of me mias tone was candysweet always a bad sign but as it happens i just signed with a tenant for the cottage not ten minutes ago bullshit you were just up in your office and nell didnt say you were with anyone on the phone mia continued with a gentleman from new york a doctor weve signed a threemonth lease for the cottage via fax i hope that relieves your mind ripley wasnt quite quick enough to mask her annoyance like i said no skin off mine what the hells a doctor going to do for three months on three sisters weve got a doctor onisland hes not a medical doctor hes a phd and as youre so interested hes coming here to work dr booke is a paranormal researcher and hes eager to spend some time on an island conjured by witches fucking a always so succinct amused mia got to her feet well my work here is done i must go see if i can bring joy into someone elses life now she strolled to the door waited a beat before she turned oh hell be here tomorrow im sure hed love to meet you ripley keep your weirdo spook hunters away from me damn it ripley bit into her cream puff shes eating this up dont go anywhere nell lifted her order peg comes on in five i want to talk to you ive got patrol you just wait damn near ruined my appetite ripley complained but managed to devour the cream puff in fifteen minutes she was stalking outside again nell glued to her side we need to talk about this look nell its no big deal i was just thinking yes you were thinking nell yanked her wool cap down over her ears and you didnt say anything to me or to zack i want to know why you feel you cant stay in your own home okay okay ripley put on her sunglasses hunched her shoulders as they started down high toward the station house it just seems to me that when people get married they need privacy its a big house were not in each others way if you were the domestic type i could see you feeling displaced because i have to spend so much of my time in the kitchen thats the least of my worries exactly you dont cook i hope you dont think i resent cooking for you no i dont think that and i appreciate it nell i really do is it because i get up so early no because i took one of the spare bedrooms for an office for sisters catering no jeez nobody was using it ripley felt as though she was being systematically pounded with a velvet bat look look its not about cooking or spare rooms or your baffling habit of getting out of bed before the sun rises its about sex excuse me you and zack have sex nell stopped cocked her head as she studied ripleys face yes we do i dont deny it in fact we have quite a lot of sex there you are ripley before i officially moved into the house zack and i often had sex there it never seemed to be a problem for you that was different that was regular sex now youre having married sex i see well i can assure you the process works in almost exactly the same way harhar nell had come a long way ripley mused thered been a time when even the hint of a confrontation would have had her backing down those days were over its just weird okay you and zack are into the mister and missus thing and youve got me hanging around what if you wanted to do the horizontal tango on the living room rug or just have dinner naked some night weve actually done the first but now ill give some serious consideration to the second ripley nell touched ripleys arm rubbed lightly i dont want you to move out jesus nell its a small island its not like id be hard to reach wherever i landed i dont want you to move she said again im speaking for myself not for zack you can talk to him separately if you want and get his feelings about it ripley i never had a sister before oh man she cringed scanning the area from behind her dark glasses dont get mushy not right out on the street like this i cant help it i like knowing youre there that i can talk to you whenever i only had a few days with your parents when they came back for the wedding but knowing them now and having you i have a family again cant we just leave things the way they are for now anyway does zack ever say no to you once you turn those big blue headlights on him not when he knows its really important to me and if you stay ill promise that when zack and i have sex well pretend were not married it might help anyway since some jerk from new york snagged the cottage right under my nose ill have to let things ride she let out a pained sigh paranormal researcher my butt phd she sneered and felt marginally cheered mia probably rented the place to him just to piss me off i doubt it but im sure shes enjoying that side benefit i wish the two of you wouldnt jab at each other so much id really hoped after after what happened on halloween you would be friends again instantly ripley closed in everybody did what had to be done now its over nothings changed for me only one phase is over nell corrected if the legend the legend is hooey even thinking of it blighted ripleys mood what we are isnt whats inside us isnt and what i do with whats inside me is my business dont go there nell all right but nell squeezed ripleys hand and even through the gloves that both women wore there was a spark of energy ill see you at dinner ripley balled her hand as nell walked away her skin still hummed from the contact sneaky little witch ripley thought she had to admire that dreams came late in the night when her mind was open and her will at rest she could deny by day close herself off stand by the choice shed made more than a decade before but sleep was a power of its own and seduced the dreaming in dreams she stood on the beach where the waves rose like terror they pounded black and bitter on the shore a thousand mad heartbeats under a blind sky the only light was the snakewhips of lightning that slashed each time she raised her arms and the light that came from her was a furious gold edged with murderous red the wind roared the violence of it the sheer unharnessed power of it thrilled her in some deep and secret place she was beyond now beyond right beyond rules beyond hope and part of her still flickering wept grievous tears for the loss she had done what she had done and now wrongs were avenged death to death to death a circle formed by hate one times three she cried out in triumph as the dark smoke of black magic streamed inside her smearing and choking out what she had been what she had vowed what she had believed this she thought as her cupped hands trembled at the force and the greed was better what had come before was pale and weak a soft belly compared to the strength and muscle of what was now she could do all and any she could take and could rule there was nothing and no one to stop her in a mad dance she spun across the sand above it her arms spread like wings her hair falling in coils like snakes she could taste the death of her sisters murderer the bright copper flavor of blood shed spilled and knew she had never supped so well her laughter shot out like bolts cracked the black bowl of the sky a torrent of dark rain fell and hissed on the sand like acid he called her somewhere through the wild night and her own fury she heard his voice the faint glow of what had been inside her struggled to burn brighter she saw him just a shadow fighting through the wind and rain to reach her love warred and wept in a heart gone cold go back she shouted at him and her voice thundered shook the world but still he came on his hands reaching toward her to gather her in to bring her back and she saw just for an instant the gleam of his eyes against the night that was love and fear out of the sky came a lance of fire even as she screamed as that light inside her leaped it speared through him she felt his death inside her the pain and horror of what shed sent out springing back times three and the light inside her winked out left her cold cold cold two he didnt look so very different from the other passengers on the ferry his long black coat flapped in the wind his hair an ordinary sort of dark blond flew around his face and had no particular style hed remembered to shave and had only nicked himself twice just under the strong line of his jaw his face and it was a good one was hidden behind one of his cameras as he snapped pictures of the island using a long lens his skin still held the tropical tan hed picked up in borneo against it his eyes were the luminous golden brown of honey just bottled his nose was straight and narrow his face a bit thin the hollows in his cheeks tended to deepen when he lost himself in work for long periods and forgot regular meals it gave him an intriguing starvingscholar look his mouth smiled easily sensually he was somewhat tall somewhat lanky and somewhat clumsy he had to grip the rail to keep a shudder of the ferry from pitching him over it hed been leaning out too far of course he knew that but anticipation often made him forget the reality of the moment he steadied himself again dipped into his coat pocket for a stick of gum he came out with an ancient lemon drop a couple of crumpled sheets of notepaper a ticket stub which baffled him as he couldnt quite remember when hed last been to the movies and a lens cap hed thought hed lost he made do with the lemon drop and watched the island hed consulted with a shaman in arizona visited a man who claimed to be a vampire in the mountains of hungary been cursed by a brujo after a regrettable incident in mexico hed lived among ghosts in a cottage in cornwall and had documented the rights and rituals of a necromancer in romania for nearly twelve years macallister booke had studied recorded witnessed the impossible hed interviewed witches ghosts lycanthropes alien abductees and psychics ninetyeight percent of them were delusional or con artists but the remaining two percent well that kept him going he didnt just believe in the extraordinary hed made it his lifes work the idea of spending the next few months on a chunk of land that legend claimed had been torn from the mainland of massachusetts by a trio of witches and settled as a sanctuary was fascinating to him hed researched three sisters island extensively and had dug up every scrap of information he could find on mia devlin the current island witch she hadnt promised him interviews or access to any of her work but he hoped to persuade her a man who had talked himself into a ceremony held by neodruids should be able to convince a solitary witch to let him watch her work a few spells besides he imagined they could make a trade he had something he was sure would interest her and anyone else who was tied into the threehundredyearold curse he lifted his camera again adjusting the framing to capture the spear of the white lighthouse the brooding ramble of the old stone house both clinging to the high cliffs he knew mia lived there high above the village close to the thick slice of forest just as he knew she owned the village bookstore and ran it successfully a practical witch who by all appearances knew how to live and live well in both worlds he could hardly wait to meet her facetoface the blast of the horn warned him to prepare for docking he walked back to his land rover put his camera in its case on the passenger seat the lens cap in his pocket was once again forgotten while he had these last few minutes to himself he updated some notes then added to the days journal entry the ferry ride was pleasant the days clear and cold i was able to take a number of pictures from different vantage points though ill need to rent a boat for views of the windward side of the island geographically topographically theres nothing unusual about three sisters island its area is approximately nine square miles and its yearround inhabitants largely in the fishing or the retail and tourist trade number less than three thousand it has a small sand beach numerous inlets coves and shale beaches it is partially forested and the indigenous fauna include whitetail deer rabbit raccoon typical seabirds for this area as well as owls hawks and pileated woodpecker in the forested regions there is one village the majority of the residents live in the village proper or within a halfmile radius though there are some houses and rental units farther afield there is nothing about the islands appearance that would indicate it is a source of paranormal activity but ive found that appearances are unreliable documentary tools im eager to meet mia devlin and begin my study he felt the slight bump of the ferrys docking but didnt look up docked three sisters island january glanced at his watch pm est the village streets were storybook tidy the traffic light mac drove through circled logging various spots on his tape recorder he could find an ancient mayan ruin in the jungle with a map scribbled on a crushed napkin but he had a habit of forgetting more pedestrian locations bank post office market ah pizzeria hot damn he found a parking place without trouble only a stop down from café book he liked the look of the place immediately the display window the view of the sea he fished around for his briefcase tossed the minirecorder inside just in case and climbed out he liked the look of the store even more on the inside the cheerful fire in a stone hearth the big checkout counter carved with moons and stars seventeenth century he decided and suitable for a museum mia devlin had taste as well as talent he started to cross to it and the little gnomelike woman sitting on a high stool behind it a movement a flash of color caught his attention mia stepped out of the stacks and smiled good afternoon can i help you his first clear thought was wow im ah hmm im looking for ms devlin mia devlin and youve found her she walked toward him held out a hand macallister booke yeah her hand was long and narrow rings sparkled on it like jewels on white silk he was afraid to squeeze too hard welcome to three sisters why dont you come upstairs ill buy you a cup of coffee or perhaps some lunch were very proud of our café ah i wouldnt mind some lunch ive heard good things about your café perfect i hope your trip in was uneventful up till now he thought it was fine thanks he followed her up the stairs i like your store so do i i hope youll make use of it during your stay on the island this is my friend and the artist of our café nell todd nell dr booke nice to meet you she showed her dimples and leaned over the counter to shake his hand dr booke has just arrived from the mainland and i imagine he could use some lunch on the house dr booke just tell nell what youd like ill take the sandwich special and a large cappuccino thanks do you do the baking too thats right i recommend the apple brown betty today ill try it mia nell asked just a cup of the soup and the jasmine tea coming up ill bring your orders out i can see im not going to have to worry about my next meal while im here mac commented as they took a window table nell also owns and runs sisters catering she delivers good to know he blinked twice but her face the sheer glory of it didnt dim okay i just have to get this out and i hope youre not offended youre the most beautiful woman ive seen in my life thank you she sat back and im not the least bit offended good i dont want things to start off on the wrong foot since im hoping to work with you and as i explained over the phone i dont work for audiences im hoping youll change your mind after you get to know me better he had a potent smile she decided charmingly crooked deceptively harmless well see about that as for your interest in the island itself and its history you wont lack for data the majority of the permanent residents here are from families whove lived on sisters for generations todd for instance he said glancing back toward the counter nell married a todd just a little under two weeks ago in fact zachariah todd our sheriff while shes new to the island the todds have indeed lived here for generations he knew who nell was the former wife of evan remington a man who had once wielded considerable power and influence in the entertainment industry a man who had been found to be a violent abuser and who was now deemed legally insane and under lock and key it had been sheriff todd whod arrested him right here on sisters island after what were reputed to be strange events on halloween night the sabbat of samhain it was something mac intended to explore in more depth even as he started to bring it up something in mias expression warned him to bide his time there looks great thanks he said instead to nell as she served their lunch enjoy mia is tonight still good for you absolutely ill come up about seven then let me know if you need anything else dr booke nells just back from her honeymoon mia said in a quiet voice when she was alone with him again i dont think questions about certain areas of her life are appropriate just now all right are you always so cooperative dr booke mac probably not but i dont want to make you mad right off the bat he bit into his sandwich good he managed really good she leaned forward toyed with her soup lulling the natives into complacency youre really good too do you have psychic abilities dont we all on some level didnt one of your papers explore the development of what you called the neglected sixth sense youve read my work i have what i am mac isnt something i neglect neither is it something i exploit or allow to be exploited i agreed to rent you the cottage and to talk with you when the mood strikes me because of one simple thing okay what you have a brilliant and more important a flexible mind i admire that as far as trusting that time will tell she glanced over and gestured and here comes a bright enough and very inflexible mind deputy ripley todd mac looked over saw the attractive brunette stride on long legs to the café counter lean on it chat with nell ripleys another common surname on the island yes shes zacks sister their mother was a ripley they have long ties on both sides of their family to the sisters very long ties mia repeated if youre looking for a cynic to weigh in on your research ripleys your girl unable to resist mia caught ripleys attention and motioned her over ordinarily ripley would merely have sneered and walked in the opposite direction but a strange face on the island usually bore checking out a goodlooking guy she thought as she strolled over in a bookish kind of way as soon as the thought hit her brows drew together bookish mias doctor of freakology dr macallister booke deputy ripley todd nice to meet you he got to his feet surprising ripley with his length as he unfolded himself from the chair most of his height she judged was leg i didnt know they gave out degrees for the study of crapola isnt she adorable mia beamed i was just telling mac that he should interview you for your narrow closed mind after all it wouldnt take much time yawn ripley hooked her thumbs in her pockets and studied macs face i dont think id have much to say that youd want to hear mias the goddess of woowoo stuff around here you have any questions about the practicalities of daytoday life on the island you can usually find me or the sheriff around appreciate it oh ive only got a masters in crapola havent finished my thesis on that one yet her lips twitched cute that your rover out front yes had he left the keys in it again he wondered already patting pockets is there a problem no nice ride im going to grab some lunch she isnt abrasive and annoying on purpose mia said when ripley walked away she was born that way its okay he sat again picked up his meal where hed left off i get a lot of that kind of thing he nodded at mia i imagine you do too now and then youre awfully well adjusted and affable arent you dr macallister booke afraid so its pretty boring i dont think so mia picked up her tea studied him over the rim no i dont think so at all mac left his things in the rover and did a solo walkthrough of the yellow cottage hed assured mia he didnt need her to come along the fact was he wanted to get a feel of the place without her she had a strong and distracting presence it was small charmingly quaint and heads above the majority of accommodations he usually had on a research jaunt he knew a lot of people thought he was a man more suited to a dark and dusty library he often was but he was just as much at home in a tent in the jungle so long as he had enough battery power for his equipment the living room here was small and cozy with a sofa that looked comfortably broken in and a little fireplace already set for lighting he decided to take care of that first and patted his pockets absently before he saw the box of wooden matches on the narrow mantel grateful for small favors he got the fire going and continued on his tour because he talked to himself habitually his voice echoed a bit two bedrooms that onell do for a suboffice i think im going to set up primarily in the living room kitchenll do if i get desperate enough to cook nell todd he dug in his pockets again came up with the business card for sisters catering that hed taken from the café counter he laid it in the middle of the stove where he would see it if he thought about cooking he looked out the windows appreciating the woods that tucked in close and the lack of other houses he often worked odd hours here he didnt have any neighbors close enough to complain he tossed the single bag hed brought in with him on the bed in the larger of the two bedrooms dropped his butt on the bed to give it a test bounce the image of mia drifted into his mind down boy he warned himself no carnal thoughts about a woman who might be able to pluck them out of your head and whos also your primary research target satisfied with his living arrangements he headed outside to unload the rover on his second trip he stopped to watch the sheriffs cruiser pull up and ripley climb out deputy todd dr booke she was feeling vaguely guilty about giving him a hard time on their first encounter which she wouldnt have felt she thought resentfully if nell hadnt scolded her about it youve got a lot of stuff here oh this is only part of it ive got more being sent in tomorrow nosy by nature she looked in the back of the rover more than this yeah lots of neat stuff she turned her head neat lots of it sensors scanners and gauges and cameras and computers cool toys he looked so pleased with the idea that she didnt have the heart to smirk ill give you a hand hauling what youve got inside thats okay some of its pretty heavy now she did smirk and hefted a large box out of the back i can handle it no question about that he decided and led the way inside thanks you work out what do you benchpress her brows lifted i do twelve reps of ninety pounds in a set she couldnt get a good gauge of his body type in the long coat and the thick sweater under it you oh about the same considering body weight he walked out again leaving her following and trying to get a sense of his shoulders and his ass what do you do with all this neat stuff study observe record document the occult the paranormal the arcane you know the different freak shows he only smiled not just his mouth she noted but his eyes as well some people think so they hauled the rest of the boxes and bags in together its going to take you a week to unpack he scratched his head scanned the piles now crowding the living space i never mean to bring so much but then you never know what you might need i was just in borneo and couldve kicked myself for not packing my backup energy detector like a motion detector but not he explained you just cant find one of those on borneo i bet ill show you he shrugged out of his coat tossed it carelessly aside before hunkering down to paw through a box surprise surprise ripley thought dr weird had one excellent butt see this ones handheld completely portable i designed it myself it put her in mind of a little geiger counter though she didnt think shed ever seen an actual geiger counter it detects and measures positive and negative force he explained simply put it reacts to charged particles in the air or in a solid object even water except this one isnt submersible im working on one that will be i can hook this up when i need to to my computer and generate a graphic printout of the size and density of the force and other pertinent data uhhuh she gave a quick glance at his face he looked so earnest she thought so pleased with his little handheld gadget youre really a total geek arent you yeah pretty much he flipped his unit on to check the batteries ive always been into the paranormal and electronics i found a way to indulge myself on both levels whatever floats your boat but she scanned the piles of boxed equipment it looked like radio shack had exploded all this hightech junk lots of dough i bet mmm he wasnt giving her his full attention his activated sensor was giving off a low but definite reading do they give you grants for stuff like this umm maybe but i never needed one im a really rich geek no kidding dont let mia know or shell jack up the rent curious she wound her way through the boxes shed always liked the little cottage well enough and was still a bit steamed that she wasnt the one moving in but things with macallister booke werent adding up for her look usually im big on minding my own business and ive got less than no interest in the stuff you do but ive just got to say you just dont seem to fit professor of strange geeky rich guy little yellow cottage what are you after he didnt smile now his face went quiet almost eerily intent answers what answers all of them i can get youve got great eyes huh i was just noticing nothing but green no gray no blue just intense green pretty she angled her head you coming on to me dr geek no he very nearly flushed i just noticed thats all half the time i dont realize im saying something thats in my head comes from spending a lot of time on my own i guess and thinking out loud right well ive got to get going he stuck the sensor in his pocket neglecting to turn it off i appreciate the help no offense before okay okay she offered her hand to shake the instant their fingers clasped the sensor in his pocket beeped madly wow wait hold on she tried again to tug her hand free but his grip turned surprisingly strong with his free hand he dragged the sensor out of his pocket look at this excitement rippled through his voice deepened it ive never had it measure anything this strong almost off the scale he began to mutter numbers as if memorizing them while he tugged her across the room hold on pal just what do you think i need to record these numbers what time is it two twentythree and sixteen seconds fascinated he passed the gauge over their joined hands jesus look at that jump is that cool or what let go right now or im taking you down huh he looked back at her face blinked once to orient himself the eyes hed admired were hard as stone now sorry he released her hand immediately and the sensors beeping began to slow sorry he repeated i get caught up especially with a new phenomenon if you could just give me a minute to record this then interface the portable with my computer i dont have time to waste while you play with your toys she shot the sensor a furious look id say you need an equipment check i dont think so he held out the palm that had clasped hers its vibrating how about yours i dont know what youre talking about ten minutes he said give me ten to put the bare essentials together and lets try it again i want to test our vital signs body temperature ambient temperature i dont let guys test my vital signs until theyve bought me dinner she jerked her thumb youre in my way he stepped to the side ill buy you dinner no thanks she headed straight for the door without looking back you are so not my type rather than waste time on annoyance when she slammed the door behind her mac searched for his recorder and began relaying the data ripley todd he finished deputy ripley todd late twenties id guess abrasive suspicious casually rude incident occurred on physical contact a handshake personal physical reactions were a tingling and warmth along the skin from point of contact up the right arm to the shoulder an increase of heart rate and a temporary feeling of euphoria deputy todds physical reaction is unsubstantiated impressions are however that she experienced the same or similar reactions which resulted in her anger and denial he sat on the arm of the sofa considering early hypothesis reached upon previous research current observations and recorded data is that todd is another direct descendant of one of the three original sisters pursing his lips mac switched off the recorder and id say the idea of that really ticks her off it took mac the rest of the afternoon and all of the evening to unpack and set up by the time he surfaced the living room looked like a hightech science lab with monitors and keyboards and cameras and sensors arranged precisely to his preferences it left very little room to maneuver but he didnt expect to be entertaining he moved what little furniture there was into one corner and tested every piece of equipment when he was finally finished the fire had long since burned out and he was starving remembering the pizzeria he grabbed his coat and started outside he was greeted by almost unrelieved darkness there was a splinter of moonlight a scatter of stars the village which according to his best memory was about a quarter mile south was nothing more than vague silhouettes shadowed under the pretty march of streetlights baffled he looked at his watch swore it was after eleven at night outside a small village on a knuckle of land there would be no pizza tonight his stomach wide awake now protested crossly hed gone hungry before often because of his own forgetfulness but he didnt have to like it without much hope he went back inside to search for crumbs in the kitchen maybe he had an old bag of trail mix or candy in his briefcase but he hit the jackpot in the freezer he found a container labeled clam chowder with instructions for heating compliments of sisters catering i love nell todd im her slave deliriously pleased he set it in the microwave at the time and temperature directed the first wisps of scent nearly had him crying he ate the entire container standing up sated refreshed and revived he decided to take a walk down to the beach two minutes later he came back and dug out a flashlight he had always liked the sound of the sea especially at night when it seemed to fill the world the cold wind was bracing the smooth velvet dark soothing as he walked he made mental notes of chores and tasks he would need to see to the following day the knowledge that most if not all of his list would be forgotten didnt stop him from making it he would need to stock up on supplies transfer some money to the local bank for convenience arrange for phone service a post office box he wanted to do more indepth research on the todd ancestry and the ripley family history as well he wondered how much information he could pump out of mia definite tension between her and the deputy hed be interested to know what caused it he needed to spend more time with both of them though neither one would be easily nudged a prickling on the back of his neck made him stop slowly turn she was glowing a faint aura of light outlined her body her face the long coils of her hair her eyes were green as a cats against the dark and watched him just as steadily just as patiently ripley he wasnt easily spooked but shed managed it i didnt know there was anyone else out here he started back toward her a ripple of air shivered over him the sand shifted under his feet he saw a single tear diamond bright slide down her cheek before she vanished like smoke three three sisters island was still and white and perfect like ripley thought one of the snow globes on the shelf at island treasures the storm that had swept through during the night had covered the beach the lawns the streets erminedraped trees stood still as a painting and the air was church quiet she hated to mar it even now zack was calling dick stubens and telling him to start up his plow soon the world would move again but for now it was still and silent irresistible a few feet of snow was one of the only things that kept her from her morning run on the beach she tossed her gym bag over her shoulder took one last whiff of whatever it was her sisterinlaw was baking and slipped out of the house for now for the length of her walk to the hotel and its health club the island belonged only to her smoke pumped from chimneys lights gleamed behind kitchen windows oatmeal was being stirred she imagined bacon was sizzling and inside those warm snug houses children were doing a dance of joy no school today was for snow battles and snow forts for sledding and mugs of hot chocolate at the kitchen table her life had been just that simple once she trudged toward the village leaving a trough in the snow the sky was a soft waiting white as if it was considering shaking out a few more inches just for good measure either way she thought she would take her hour at the gym then head back home to help zack shovel out the cruiser and nells car as she crossed into the village she looked down and frowned the snow wasnt pristine here as shed expected as shed wanted it to be someone else had been out and about early too and had left a narrow path it irritated her it was a tradition almost a ritual that she be the first to break the field of snow on this part of the island now someone had spoiled her routine and pricked her contentment bubble she kicked at the snow and kept walking the path led as hers did toward the gothic stone hotel the magick inn some mainlander she decided whod come out of his hotel room early to see a genuine new england village in the snow hard to blame him she admitted but he might have waited another hour she stomped up the short flight of steps bumped the bulk of the snow off her boots and went inside she waved to the desk clerk hitching up her gym bag and jogged up the lobby steps to the second floor she had a longstanding payasyougo deal with the hotel for health club privileges she preferred working out on her own and during the summer she used the sea as her pool so an official membership wasnt worth her while turning left she headed straight into the womens locker room as far as she could remember only a handful of guests were in residence this week more than likely she would have the gym and the pool to herself after dumping her outerwear in the locker that the hotel kept for her she stripped down to her black sports bra and bike pants tugged on her socks and crosstrainers her mood was up again at the prospect of a good sweaty bout with the resistance machines and free weights since she despised the treadmill she would save the aerobic portion of her workout for the hotel pool she circled around the locker room for the door leading to the gym she heard the clang of metal on metal before she saw anyone her mood wavered again the tv was on tuned to one of the earlymorning shows full of chatter and cheer she preferred blasting music when she worked out but her glance toward the bench press turned her scowl into interesting speculation she couldnt see much of him but what she could see was superior long legs toned and muscled and already sheened with sweat long arms sleek biceps rippling on the lift and set she approved of his shoes a good brand basic style and far from new he was benchpressing in smooth steady reps better and better this wasnt a weekend warrior but a regular and if the rest of him lived up to his limbs he was hot if she was going to have to share the equipment with someone he might as well be hot buff and sweaty just the way i like em she thought with delight she was missing men at least missing sex she would just check out mr fitness here and see if he lived up to the advertising she snagged a towel hooked it around her shoulders and wandered his way need a spotter she began then nearly choked as she looked down into macs face he grunted lowered the bar hey hows it going some snow last night huh yeah some snow in disgust she turned away to begin her warmup stretches wouldnt you just know it just as she starts to get stirred up mr fitness turns out to be dr geek nice club he commented grunting a little as he pressed the bar up i was surprised to find it empty not much traffic in the hotel this time of year she spared him a look he hadnt shaved and that shadow of stubble turned the attractive bookworm face into something edgy sexy damn it he was hot did you get a membership she asked him yeah damn lost count well he hooked the bar on the safety scooted up you work out here regularly no ive got a setup at home free weights a bowflex but when i cant run outside i like to use their stuff and the pool are you watching this junk he adjusted the weight and pressure on another machine glanced at the television not especially taking this for a no she switched it off while he settled into leg presses she turned the music on and up to blasting to discourage any conversation unfazed mac worked through his routine while she worked through hers he watched her mostly out of the corner of his eye he didnt ogle women in health clubs it wasnt well polite but he was human it was only the two of them and she had one beautiful tight body shame about the attitude he thought about what hed seen on the beach two nights before that instant when hed thought it was ripley standing there of course it hadnt been hed realized that almost immediately the eyes had been almost the same that sharp intense and pure green but the woman or the vision or whatever it had been on the beach hadnt had that taut disciplined body and her hair while dark and long had been curling coils where ripleys was straight as rain and the face though thered been some resemblance had been softer sadder rounder added to all that was the fact that he didnt think ripley todd would stand on a dark beach weeping then vanish into the air it had been one of the sisters he was sure and from the research hed done he was betting on the one called earth still deputy todd was a part of it all he was sure of that too he just wasnt sure how to chip through that flinty attitude and work on that is work with her since he intended to do just that it wasnt a coincidence that they picked up free weights at the same time she started with flies he followed suit despite the music they were close enough now for him to speak without shouting and feeling like a moron hows the food in the restaurant here two restaurants fine fancy ones pricey you up for breakfast after this im buying she slanted him a look thanks but ive got to get back he saw her gaze at his weights he was pumping twenties she was using tens but between the beat of the music and the mirrored motions they were lifting in unison ive got my equipment set up he set it casually as they both switched motions youll have to come by and take a look why would i do that curiosity if youre uneasy about what happened last time i can promise not to touch you im not uneasy about anything there was just enough bite in her voice to show him exactly how to chip away some women were vain about their looks or their brains ripley was vain about her spine i couldnt blame you for being reluctant to come around or even to talk to me after that his smile was back easygoing edging toward sheepish i tend to forget that laypeople arent used to paranormal events it can be scary you think im afraid she gritted her teeth continued her reps you dont scare me booke and neither do your stupid toys im glad to hear that voice cheerful face pleasant he finished off the mat routine and got up to do bicep curls i was a little worried the way you took off i didnt take off she snapped it out and began to work on her triceps i left whatever i had work to do okay she sucked in a breath and imagined what would happen to that dopey grin of his if she smashed her barbell in his face you may be the idle rich buddy but i work for a living absolutely if youre not worried about the energy spike the other day id really like you to come back now that im up and running itll help to recreate the event or see if it can be recreated not interested ill pay you for your time i dont need your money that doesnt make it less useful think about it he decided to cut his routine short and give her the time to do just that by the way he added as he replaced the weights nice abs she merely peeled back her lips to show her teeth as he strolled out imagine she thought as she finished out her routine a dork like that accusing her of being afraid if it hadnt been so laughable it wouldve been insulting then thinking he could buy her time for his ridiculous experiments or study or whatever the hell he called what he did it was a shame a damn shame that he was the bestlooking and certainly the bestbuilt guy shed run across in months if he hadnt been such an irritating moron they could have enjoyed some workouts of an entirely different nature instead she was going to have to make the effort to avoid him whenever possible it wouldnt be easy but she would make it her winter project with her muscles comfortably fatigued she went back in the locker room showered off pulled on her tank suit and headed into the pool area and realized immediately she should have known he was already in the pool doing laps with slow almost lazy strokes it surprised her to see that his tan covered every inch of him or every inch she could see the black speedo he wore wasnt hiding much she wasnt giving up her swim even if it meant sharing the water with him tossing her fresh towel aside she dived in when she surfaced he was an armspan away casually treading water ive got an idea i bet youre just full of them she dipped her head and slicked the hair back from her face look i want to get in my laps and go its a big pool you stay on that side ill stay on this one lets not call it an idea lets call it a proposition booke youre going to piss me off i didnt mean he did flush now a perfectly gorgeous combination with that manly stubble the little twist of lust in her belly really put her off i didnt mean to imply he took two careful breaths knowing he would stutter otherwise i meant a race he knew hed caught her competitive streak by the way her eyes glinted just before she turned in the water and swam to the side not interested ill give you a quarterlength handicap yeah no question youre going to piss me off four lengths he continued clamping onto the idea like a hound onto a bone if you win i dont bother you again if i win i get one hour of your time one hour against three months those are pretty favorable odds for you she started to brush him off wanted to brush him off he couldnt bother her if she didnt let him bother her there was only one slight hitch she couldnt resist a dare four lengths head to head she pulled swim goggles over her head adjusted them when i win you keep your distance you dont mention your project or whatever you call it to me again and you dont try hitting on me on a personal level now that last part stings deputy but agreed if i win you come to the cottage assist me in some tests one hours work with your full cooperation deal when he held out a hand she simply stared at it blandly forget it she waited for him to join her at the wall prepared herself with long slow breaths freestyle okay on three she nodded one two they pushed off together on three cut through the water she didnt intend to lose didnt even consider it a possibility she swam nearly every day of her life and she was the home team she noted his form as they paced each other on the first lap it wasnt bad but hers was better they slapped the far wall pushed off for the second lap she was beautiful to watch and he hoped he had the opportunity to do more of it under less intense circumstances it wasnt just strength he noted she had the fluid disciplined grace of the true athlete hed never deluded himself that he qualified in that area but if there was one thing he could do it was swim he had to admit he hadnt expected them to be so evenly matched he had a longer reach and a good seven inches on her in body length but the woman had a powerful kick he picked up the pace testingly on the third length she matched it he found himself both challenged and amused she was toying with him he put on more speed and admitted it was a damn good thing shed tossed his handicap back in his face the sonofabitch was like an eel ripley thought when they shoved off for the final lap in tandem she realized shed seriously misjudged his abilities gathering herself she poured it on nipped past him by a quarter of a body length felt her adrenaline kick in for that final push and was struck with shock and dazed admiration when he streamed by her and slapped the wall two strokes ahead chest heaving she surfaced shoved back her goggles no one not even zack could beat her at four lengths it was demoralizing so he panted shoved his hair back any time today good for you the bastard hadnt even had the courtesy to rub it in it only made the taste of defeat more sour hed been so so damn pleasant about the whole thing she began to wonder if he was on drugs surely no one could stay so eventempered without chemical assistance she worked off part of her mad shoveling snow soothed her bruised ego with some of nells famous cinnamon buns but it picked at her a restless fingernail at a scab throughout the day there were a number of calls to keep her busy cars sliding off the road a smashed window due to a poorly aimed snowball and the usual variety of mischief that liberated kids could create on a snow day still it worried her mind and spoiled her mood in the station house zack listened to her muttered curses watched her pour yet another cup of coffee he was a patient man and he knew his sister hed crossed paths with her several times that day on patrol and had recognized the signs of her temper brewing but since it hadnt passed he was going to have to poke it out of her now seemed like a good time he was enjoying a coffee break of his own with his feet propped up on the desk are you going to keep chewing on whatevers got your goat or spit it out nothings got my goat she slurped at coffee burned her tongue cursed youve been in a stew since you got back from the gym this morning i dont stew you stew i brood he corrected which is a solitary and thoughtful process involving finding the solution to a conflict or situation stewing is stirring a bubbling pot until it boils over and spills on someone as im the only one currently in harms way i have a vested interest about the contents of this particular pot she turned back to him with a dangerous sneer thats the stupidest thing i ever heard see he wagged his finger at her youre trying to figure out how to take it out on me tell me who pissed you off and well go whip their asses together he had a way about him ripley admitted that could make her laugh in the worst of times she walked over to the desk sat on the edge have you met this booke character the big brain from new york yeah i met him yesterday when he was out walking the village getting his bearings seems nice enough nice she snorted do you know what hes here for zack grunted an assent she only had to mention macallister booke for zack to clue in to the source of her mad rip we deal with variations of this theme off and on all the time we cant live on sisters and avoid it this is different maybe it is he was frowning himself when he got up to replenish his coffee what happened with nell last fall raises eyebrows and not just because she came back figuratively from the dead or that that bastard remington was exposed as someone who got his rocks off knocking her around during their marriage not even because he threatened to kill her once he tracked her here and stabbed you she said it quietly because she could still see the blood on his shirt the way it had gleamed dark in the shadows of the forest all of that made good press copy zack continued a big juicy scandal but you add how it all went down we kept a lid on that as best we could he agreed he stopped beside her touched her face he knew shed broken a promise to herself that night linking hands with mia using what she had inside her to save nell to save him enough got out he said quietly rumor and speculation and the babblings of a madman enough to build more to spark interest you had to expect something along these lines i expected the weirdos she admitted maybe an increase in the gawking tourists that sort of thing this booke is different hes the serious article a kind of i dont know crusader and hes got credentials a lot of people may think hes just another nutcase but a lot wont added to all that mia might get it into her head to talk to him to cooperate with him yeah she might he didnt want to add that he was all but sure nell would as well theyd already had a discussion about it its her choice rip it doesnt have to weigh on yours she gave her coffee a disgusted look he won an hour from me what sneaky sonofabitch conned me into a bet this morning i lost so i have to give him an hour with his voodoo crap ouch howd you lose dont wanna talk about it she muttered but he was already trying to work it out you didnt go anywhere but the gym this morning did you i heard he picked up a membership there is that where you ran into him yeah yeah yeah she pushed off the desk paced whod have thought he could move like that at a sprint okay i could see it because of his height advantage but not at a hundred sixty foot freestyle a swim race zack voiced his surprise he took you in a swim race i said i dont want to talk about it i was off my rhythm thats all she whirled back with a slanted look was that a laugh i heard you bet no wonder youre stewing just shut up i dont know what he thinks he can prove in an hour anyway with his energy detectors and spirit sensors its a waste of time then youve got nothing to worry about how much he take you by shut up zack she decided to get it over with the way you would a root canal and shed decided to walk leaving zack with the cruiser because that postponed the gettingitoverwith stage just a little longer it was full dark when she made the turn to the yellow cottage and the moon was new and black another three inches of snow had fallen since morning but the clouds had passed by evening the clear wash of sky and stars sucked out any hope of warmth in the air the cold was clean and sharp as a razor slicing keenly against any exposed skin she walked fast using her flashlight to guide the way she shook her head when she ran the beam over macs rover he hadnt bothered to dig it out typical nutty professor behavior she decided ignoring the practical she stomped up to the door pounded with a woolcovered fist he answered wearing a gray sweatshirt that had seen better days and jeans that looked equally well used she caught the unmistakable scent of nells beefandbarley soup and quickly decided it was that and that alone that made her mouth water hi jesus its freezing out there must be down around zero even as he stepped back to let her in he looked outside no car you walked in this are you crazy she studied the equipment jammed cheek by jowl into the tiny living room you live like this and you ask if im crazy its too cold to be out for an evening stroll instinctively he took her gloved hands rubbing them between his own you get grabby were on the clock check the attitude his voice wasnt mild and easygoing now but hot as a bullet it had her eyeing him speculatively have you ever seen frostbite as a matter of fact hey she yanked back when he pulled off her gloves to examine her fingers i was with a group in nepal a few years ago one of the students got careless ignoring her resistance he wiggled her fingers he lost two of these im not careless okay let me take your coat she shrugged out of it the neck scarf the wool cap the insulated vest piling each layer she peeled off into his arms i guess youre not careless then he glanced around looking for a place to dump everything she couldnt help it she grinned the floors good enough no well just the bed he remembered and carted them out down the narrow path hed made to the bedroom are you afraid of the dark she called out huh youve got every light on in this place i do he came out again im always forgetting to turn things off i bought a quart of nells soup today i just nuked it do you want some he waited a beat reading her perfectly eatings off the clock im not hungry she quickly responded and felt a good sulk coming on okay ill have it later so we can get started where did i put he patted his pockets circled oh yeah and found his minirecorder beside a monitor i want to get some basic personal data first so well just he broke off again brow furrowed hed piled old files clippings research books photographs and other tools on the sofa even the floor didnt offer enough room for two people to sit tell you what well do this part in the kitchen she shrugged her shoulders stuffed her hands in her pockets and followed him back im going to go ahead and eat since its here he took down a bowl then decided to take pity on her why dont you change your mind so i dont feel rude eating in front of you fine got a beer no sorry got a pretty decent merlot though thatll work she stood while he dumped soup in bowls poured wine have a seat he settled down across from her got up immediately damn it one more minute go ahead and eat ripley picked up her spoon as he hurried back out she heard muttering papers rattling and a small crash as something hit the floor he came back with a spiral notebook two pencils and a pair of metalframed glasses the minute he slipped them on her stomach clutched oh man she thought an incredibly sexy geek im going to take notes he explained back up the tape hows the soup its nells she said simply yeah he began to eat she saved my life the other night when i lost track of time i found a container of chowder in the freezer and nearly broke down and cried your brothers a lucky man i met him yesterday so he said she began to relax thinking that as long as he made small talk the clock was ticking theyre great together i got that impression how old are you what your age for the record i dont know what the hell that has to do with anything i turned thirty last month what day fourteenth sagittarius you know the time of birth i wasnt paying a lot of attention at the time she picked up her wine i think my mother said it was about eight at night after sixteen hours of sweating in the valley of the shadow and so on why do you need that ill input the data and run an astrological chart give you a copy if you want that stuffs totally bogus youd be surprised you were born on the island yeah at home doctor and midwife in attendance have you ever experienced any paranormal activity she didnt mind lying but she hated the fact that it always made her throat feel tight why would i do you remember your dreams sure i had a doozy the other night about harrison ford a peacock feather and a bottle of canola oil what do you think that means since a cigar is sometimes just a cigar sexual fantasies are sometimes just about sex do you dream in color yeah sure always she moved her shoulders black and whites for bogart movies and art photography are your dreams ever prophetic she nearly answered in the affirmative before she caught herself so far harry and i havent gotten it on but i have hope he switched tactics got any hobbies hobbies you mean like quilting or birdwatching no what do you do with your free time i dont know she nearly squirmed before she caught herself stuff tv movies i do some sailing bogart movies top pick maltese falcon what do you sail zacks little day cruiser she tapped her fingers on the table let her mind drift i think im going to get my own though nothing like a day on the water when did you realize you had power it was never a she straightened carefully wiped all expression off her face i dont know what you mean yes you do but we can let that slide for the moment if it makes you uncomfortable im not uncomfortable i just dont understand the question he set his pencil down nudged the bowl of soup aside and looked directly at her lets put it this way then when did you realize you were a witch four she heard the blood rush and roar in her head pulsing in time with the gallop of her heart he sat calmly studying her as if she were some mildly interesting lab experiment her temper began to tick like a bomb what kind of a stupid question is that with some its an instinct hereditary knowledge others are taught the way a child is taught to walk and talk there are some who come into it at the onset of puberty countless others i believe who go through life without ever realizing their potential now he made her feel as though she was a slightly dimwitted student i dont know where you get this stuff or where youve come up with the halfbaked idea that im she wasnt going to say it wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of saying it this hocuspocus area is your deal not mine dr weird intrigued he cocked his head why are you angry im not angry she leaned forward want to see me angry not particularly but im willing to bet that if i put a sensor on you right now id get some very interesting readings im finished betting with you in fact im finished with you period he let her get to her feet continued to make notes you still have fortyfive minutes on your time if youre going to renege he swept his gaze up met her furious stare i can only assume youre afraid it wasnt my intention to frighten or upset you i apologize stuff your apology she strained against pride always her most fretful war shed made the damn bet shed accepted the terms with a badtempered jerk she scraped her chair back out and sat again he didnt rub it in only continued to make notes as if ripley thought grinding her teeth hed known all along he would win im going to take a wild leap here you dont practice i have nothing to practice youre not a stupid woman and my impression is youre very selfaware he watched her face she was trying to remain steady but there was something beneath the calm veneer some strong even passionate emotion he wanted desperately to dig in discover it discover her but he would never get the chance he realized if he alienated her so quickly im assuming this is a sensitive area for you im sorry ive already told you what you can do with your apology you can do the same with your assumptions ripley he lifted a hand spread his fingers in a gesture of peace im not a reporter looking for a story im not a groupie looking for a show or a neophite searching for a mentor this is my work i can promise to respect your privacy keep your name out of my documentation i wont do anything to hurt you you dont worry me booke youre going to have to look for your guinea pig elsewhere im not interested in your work is nell the third you leave nell alone before she could think she reached across gripped his wrist you mess with her ill take you apart he didnt move didnt even breathe her pupils had gone so dark they were nearly black where her fingers gripped were points of heat so intense he wouldnt have been surprised to see his skin smoke bring harm to none he managed in a voice that somehow remained steady thats not just craft philosophy i believe it i wont do anything to hurt your sisterinlaw or you ripley very slowly watching her as he might a guard dog who had snapped its chain he brought his hand up to cover hers you cant control it can you his voice was soft not completely he gave her hand a squeeze that was almost friendly youre burning my wrist with that statement she lifted her fingers spread them but her hand wasnt steady as she looked down saw the red welts where her fingers had been i wont do this she struggled to bring her breathing back to normal to close off that violent spike of energy to be herself again here she hadnt heard him get up or go to the sink in an instant he was standing beside her offering her a glass of water after shed taken it gulped it down she was no longer sure whether she was angry or embarrassed but she was sure it was his fault youve no right to come here prying into peoples lives knowledge and truth save us from chaos his tone was quiet reasonable and made her want to bite him tempering them with compassion and tolerance makes us human without those things fanatics feed on fear and ignorance the way they did in salem three hundred years ago not hanging witches anymore doesnt make the world tolerant i dont want to be part of your study thats the bottom line okay she looked so tired all at once he noted boneweary it stirred him a mixture of guilt and sympathy all right but something happened the other night that might make that difficult for both of us he waited a moment while she shifted in her chair then gave him her reluctant attention i saw a woman on the beach at first i thought it was you same eyes same coloring she was very alone and brutally sad she looked at me for one long moment then vanished ripley pressed her lips together then picked up her wine maybe youve been drinking too much merlot she wants redemption i want to help her find it you want data she tossed back you want to legitimate your crusade maybe cop a book deal i want to understand no he admitted that wasnt all of it that wasnt the core of it i want to know then talk to mia she loves attention you grew up together yeah so it was easier he decided even more pleasant to deal with her when she had her attitude back in place i caught some tension between the two of you i must repeat myself so curiosity is the scientists first tool it also killed the cat ripley said with a glimmer of her former sneer and i dont call bopping around the globe playing witchhunter science you know thats just what my father says he spoke cheerfully as he rose to take their soup bowls to the sink your father sounds like a sensible man oh he is that im a constant disappointment to him no thats unfair mac decided as he came back topped off their wine im more a puzzle and hes sure some of the pieces have gone missing so tell me about your parents theyre retired my father was sheriff before zack my mother was a cpa they took their life on the road a while back in a big winnebago hitting the national parks that and whatever theyre having the time of their lives like a couple of kids on an endless spring break it wasnt what she said so much as how she said it that told him the todd family was tight and happy her problem with her power didnt stem from family conflict he was sure of that you and your brother work together obviously there was no doubt about it she was back i met him the other day youre not much like him he glanced up from his notes except for the eyes zack got all the niceguy genes in the family there werent any left over for me you were there when he was injured while arresting evan remington her face went very still again do you want to read the police report actually i have it mustve been a rough night and lets just circle around that for now he decided do you like being a cop i dont do things i dont like lucky you why the maltese falcon huh i was wondering why you picked that instead of say casablanca ripley shook her head adjusted her thoughts i dont know because i figure bergman shouldve told bogart paris my butt instead of getting on the plane in falcon he did the job he turned astor over that was justice i always figured ilsa and rick got together after the war and sam spade well he just kept being sam spade what kind of music do you like what music you said you like working out to music what does that have to do with your project you said you didnt want to be involved in my work we might as well pass the rest of the time getting to know each other she blew out a breath sipped her wine youre a really strange individual all right then enough about you lets talk about me he sat back and when her face blurred out of focus remembered to remove his reading glasses im thirtythree embarrassingly rich the second son of the new york bookes real estate the macallister branch we have that surname as first name in common theyre corporate law i got interested in preternatural subjects when i was a kid the history variations the effect on cultures and societies my interest caused my family to seek the advice of a psychologist who assured them this was just a form of rebellion they took you to a shrink because you liked spooky when youre a fourteenyearold college freshman someones always calling the shrink fourteen she pursed her lips that had to be strange well it was pretty hard to get a date let me tell you the slight twitching of her lips pleased him i channeled the energy from what would have been those first sexual rumbles into study and my personal interest so you got off on books and research in a manner of speaking by the time i was eighteen my parents had given up on trying to box me into one of the family firms then i hit twentyone and came into the first lap of my trust fund and could do what i wanted she angled her head she was interested now couldnt help herself did you ever get a date a couple i know what it is to be pushed in a direction you dont want to go or one youre not ready for people say they know whats best for you maybe sometimes its true but it doesnt matter if they keep pushing until they take your choices away is that why youre letting me off the hook tonight thats one reason another is because youre going to change your mind dont get steamed he said quickly when her mouth thinned when i first came here i thought it would be mia i needed to work with but its you at least primarily its you why thats something id like to find out meanwhile youve paid off your bet ill drive you home im not going to change my mind then its a good thing ive got plenty of time to waste ill get your coat and i dont need you to drive me home we can armwrestle over that he called back but im not letting you walk home in the dark in subzero temperatures you cant drive me home you didnt dig out your car so ill dig it out then drive you home five minutes shed have argued with that but the front door slammed and she was left stewing in the house alone curious she eased open the back door stood shivering while she watched him attack the snow around the rover with a shovel she had to admit those muscles shed seen that morning in the gym werent just for show it appeared that dr booke knew how to put his back into the job at hand still he wasnt particularly thorough she nearly called out to say so when it occurred to her that any comment she made would prove shed been interested enough to watch him instead she shut the door and rubbed the warmth back into her hands and arms when the front door slammed again and she heard him stomping his feet she was leaning against the kitchen counter looking bored bitching cold out there he called back where did i put your stuff in the bedroom and since she had a minute she scurried around the table to flip through his notes hissed when she saw they were in shorthand or what she assumed was shorthand in any case the notes were odd symbols lines and loops that meant nothing to her but the sketch in the center of a page had her gaping it was her face and a damn good likeness too a quick pencil sketch full face she looked annoyed she decided and watchful well he was right about that too there was no doubt in her mind that macallister booke bore watching she was standing a foot away from the table her hands innocently in her pockets when he came back took me a few minutes longer because i couldnt find my keys i still cant figure out what they were doing in the bathroom sink poltergeist she said sweetly and made him laugh i wish i just never seem to put anything in the same place twice hed tracked snow through the house rather than point it out ripley slipped on her vest and scarf he held her coat made her shake her head when she realized he intended to help her on with it i can never figure that out how do you guys figure we get our coats on when youre not around we have no idea amused he set her cap on her head then pulled her hair through the back as hed seen her wear it gloves she pulled them out of her pocket are you going to put them on for me too daddy sure honey but when he reached out she slapped his hand away and was grinning until she saw the welts on his wrist guilt churned in her she didnt mind hurting someone when they deserved it but not that way never that way still what was done could be undone even if it did mean swallowing pride he saw a change in her expression as she stared at his wrist its no big deal he began and started to pull his cuffs down it is to me she didnt bother to sigh but took his wrist again her gaze shot up held his this is off my time off the record off everything understood all right what in anger i have harmed i regret and spin this charm heal this hurt caused by me by the power of one times three as i will so mote it be he felt the mild pain the heat lift away from his skin the flesh where her fingers lay was now cool as if theyd drawn the burns out there was a jump in his belly not so much from the physical change as from the change in her eyes he had looked into power before and knew he looked into it now it was something he never forgot to respect thanks he told her dont mention it she turned away i mean that when she reached for the doorknob on the kitchen door his hand its wrist unmarked closed over it first we dont know how you open doors either he said theyre so heavy and complicated funny guy when they stepped out his hand slid under to cup her elbow the long baleful look she sent him only brought on a shrug its a little icy i cant help it its very difficult to resist early childhood training she let it go and didnt have the heart to jab at him when he walked her around the rover and opened the passenger door for her it wasnt much of a drive but as she directed him she realized she was indeed grateful for the lift even in the hour shed been inside the temperature had dropped the heater wouldnt have time to kick in but at least they were out of the open air air that seemed cold enough to break if youre looking for more firewood jack stubens sells it by the cord she told him stubens can you write that down steering onehanded he dug in his pocket got any paper no try the glove compartment she opened it and felt her jaw drop in shock there were dozens of notes countless pens rubber bands a halfempty bag of pretzels three flashlights a hunting knife and several unidentified objects she pulled one out that looked to be made up of red twine various beads and human hair whats this he glanced over grisgris it was a gift no paper she stared at him another moment then put the charm back and pulled out one of the many scribbled notes stubens she repeated scrawling it on the scrap of paper jack over on owl haunt lane thanks he took the paper stuffed it in his pocket turn here its the twostory wraparound porch as the police cruiser was in the drive he couldve figured it out for himself lights were glowing cheerfully in the windows and smoke puffed out of the chimney nice house he got out and though shed already hopped down before he could come around and open her door he took her arm again look mac its kind of cute and all that but you dont need to walk me to the door this wasnt a date its a compulsion besides we had a meal and conversation and wine so thats several date elements she stopped on the porch turned hed pulled a ski cap on and his dark blond hair escaped here and there he couldnt help but look at her intensely so what you want a kiss good night now okay the response was so cheerful so harmlessly cheerful she grinned but only for an instant he had moves smooth unexpected incredible moves it wasnt fast but it was so slick so silky she had no time to readjust to think his arms came around her slid her against him body to body so that without any real pressure she was molded to him he dipped her back just the slightest bit and somehow conjured the illusion that they were horizontal instead of vertical the intimacy of it jolted through her sent her head on a dizzy spin even before his mouth took hers soft warm deep his lips didnt brush or nibble but simply absorbed now the dizziness was joined by a shimmering wave of heat that seemed to start in her toes and rise until it melted every bone a little sound stunned pleasure hummed in her throat her lips parted in welcome oh more it took two tries to lift her boneless arms and circle his neck her knees buckled it wouldnt have surprised her to feel her body simply dissolve and slide in little liquid drops into a pool at his feet when he eased back gently set her away her vision was blurred her mind blank well have to do this again sometime he said uh she couldnt quite remember how to form words he gave her hair a friendly tug better get inside before you freeze ah she gave up turned blindly and walked into the door let me get that for you he spoke quietly quite soberly and turned the knob nudged the door open good night ripley mmm she stepped inside then had no choice but to lean back against the door he closed until she got her bearings and her breath back harmless had she actually thought he was harmless she managed to stagger a few steps then lowered herself to the bottom tread of the staircase she would just wait until her legs were back under her she decided before she tried to make it upstairs to her room january pm est ill transcribe my notes and the tape from my initial interview with ripley todd shortly i didnt make as much progress with her as id hoped however there were two specific incidents that will be set down in more detail in my official log my personal reaction however belongs here ripleys temperament and her protective attitude toward her sisterinlaw nell todd can and will overpower her reluctance to discuss her gift or as i learned tonight to demonstrate that gift its my impression that her warning to me when i mentioned nell was instinctive and the result was unplanned harming me was a byproduct rather than a goal the burns on my wrist from visual examination matched the grip and shape of her fingers it wasnt a flash burn but more a steady increase in heat as you might experience when turning up a flame her physical changes during this phenomenon were a dilation of pupils a flush under the skin her anger turned inward immediately i believe this lack of control and a fear of what she is capable of are what cause her reluctance to discuss and explore the nature of her talents shes an interesting woman one obviously close to her family in all areas but this i sense and observe a complete confidence an ease of self shes beautiful when she smiles he stopped nearly crossed out his last observation it wasnt even accurate she wasnt beautiful attractive intriguing but not beautiful still he reminded himself the journal was for impressions the thought that she was beautiful must have been in his mind for him to note it down so it stayed the second incident occurred just before we left and was i have no doubt more difficult for her the fact that she would remove the burns deliberately demonstrate her ability indicates a strong sense of right and wrong that as with her instinct to protect who and what she loves overcomes her need to block off her gift i hope as time goes on to discover what event or events influenced her to deny or abjure her powers i need to see her again to verify my suppositions oh hell he muttered if he couldnt be honest here where i want to see her again on a completely personal level ive enjoyed being with her even when shes rude and insulting it worries me a bit that i might enjoy being with her because shes rude and insulting beyond that theres a strong sexual attraction unlike the sheer admiration for beauty i felt on first meeting mia devlin and the completely natural and human fantasy that resulted this is more basic and therefore more compelling i want on one level to carefully take this complex woman apart piece by piece and understand what she is on the other i just want to nope mac decided even a personal journal needed some censoring he couldnt write down just what he wanted to do with ripley todd i find myself wondering what it would be like to be her lover there he thought that was acceptable no point in going into graphic detail i drove her home tonight as the temperatures are hovering at zero fahrenheit the fact that she had walked here and would have walked home under such conditions demonstrates her stubbornness as well as her independence she was very obviously amused at simple courtesies such as helping her with her coat holding the door not insulted but amused which i found disarming i wouldnt have kissed her if she hadnt brought it up i certainly had no intention of doing so at this early stage of our relationship her response was unexpected and arousing shes a strong woman body and mind and to feel her going almost limp he had to stop take a breath guzzle some of the water hed poured to feel the reaction of her body to mine and the heat knowing the chemical and biological causes for the increase of body heat during such an event doesnt diminish the wonder of the experience i can still taste her strong again a strong and sharp flavor and hear the kind of purr she made down in her throat my legs went weak and when her arms came around my neck it was like being surrounded by her another minute another instant and i would have forgotten that we were standing on an open porch on a bitterly cold night but since i had despite her teasing initiated the embrace it was my responsibility at least i had the satisfaction of seeing her face and the dazed dreamy expression in her eyes and of watching her walk straight into the door that was a good one of course i nearly ran off the road twice coming back to the cottage and got lost but that part isnt atypical without the stimuli yes i want to see her again on a number of levels and i dont expect to sleep particularly well tonight five nell iced the last batch of cinnamon buns and bided her time she had an hour before she needed to load up her car with the café stock todays soup was porcini mushroom and it was already sealed in the kettle the three salad selections were prepared the muffins baked shed finished the napoleons shed been up and at it since fivethirty diego her sleek gray cat was curled on one of the kitchen chairs watching her lucy the big black lab sprawled in a corner watching diego they had come to terms diegos terms and lived together in an acceptable state of distrust and suspicion while her cookies baked nell kept the radio on low and waited when ripley entered blearyeyed wearing the sweatpants and football jersey shed slept in nell simply held out a mug of coffee ripley grunted as close to a thankyou as she could manage before caffeine and plopped into a chair too much snow for your morning run ripley grunted again she never felt completely herself without her three miles but the coffee was helping she sipped idly patted lucys head when the lab came over to greet her shed have to use the damn treadmill hated that but she couldnt go two days without a run zack was taking the first shift where the hell was zack so she could wait until midmorning before popping into the gym she didnt want to run into mac not that he worried her or anything shed already reasoned out a number of very plausible excuses for her reaction to that goodnight kiss she just didnt want to deal with him that was all there was to it nell set a bowl in front of her ripley blinked at it what oatmeal suspicious and far from enthusiastic ripley leaned over and sniffed whats in it nutrition nell took a batch of cookies from the oven slid in another tray try it before you make icky faces okay okay she had been making icky faces behind nells back it was sort of lowering to be caught at it she sampled pursed her lips took another spoonful there didnt seem to be anything nell put together that didnt go down well its good my mother used to cook oatmeal in the winter but it looked like gray glue tasted worse your mother has other talents nell poured herself a cup of coffee shed all but shoved zack out of the house early so she could grab this time with ripley she didnt intend to waste it she sat so how did it go what your evening with mac booke it wasnt an evening it was an hour defensive nell thought cranky well well how did your hour go it came and it went which wraps up my obligation i was glad he drove you home at ripleys lifted brows nell blinked her baby blues innocently i heard the car and had looked out the window had seen mac walk ripley to the door thered been quite the little time lag before hed walked back to the car yeah he was all its too cold out youll get frostbite and die before you get home she shoved oatmeal into her mouth then wagged her spoon like i dont know how to take care of myself guys like that burn me he cant even find his keys half the time but im going to wander off and turn into a popsicle please im glad he drove you home nell repeated yeah well ripley sighed toyed with her oatmeal by putting little crescentshaped dents on it with the tip of her spoon she decided it looked sort of like a moonscape if he hadnt driven her home shed have been fine but shed have missed one whale of a kiss not that she was obsessing about it or anything you wouldnt recognize the cottage she went on it looks like the den of some mad scientist all this electronic and computer junk shoved in there no place to sit down except the kitchen the guys totally wrapped up in his spook show hes even got some voodoo charm in his glove compartment he knows about me she finished in a rush and lifted her gaze to nells oh nell drew in a quiet breath did you tell him ripley shook her head her insides jittered infuriating her he just knew like i had a sign on my forehead saying local witch its all real academic with him well this is interesting deputy todd perhaps you could conjure something for me for the recorder did he ask you to do magic no ripley rubbed her hands over her face no she said again but i damn it he pissed me off and i i burned him oh my god coffee sloshed at the rim as nell set her cup down i didnt set him on fire or anything i burned his wrist with my fingers she stared down at them now harmless ordinary maybe a little on the long side with short unpainted nails nothing special lethal i didnt think about it not consciously all the mad went to heat and the heat went to my fingers i havent needed to think about it to worry about it in so long the last few months since you opened back up to help me nell finished quietly she rose at the buzz of the oven timer i dont regret that nell not for an instant it was my choice and id do it again its just that its been harder to lock everything down again i dont know why wouldnt admit why she thought and ground that thought to dust it just is i caused physical harm i had to fix it but that doesnt make up for causing it how did he deal with it like it was no big deal got me a glass of water practically patted me on the head and went back to conversation like id done nothing more than spill some wine on the tablecloth the mans got cajones ill give him that nell walked back stroked ripleys hair as she might have stroked a child youre too hard on yourself i cant even count the mistakes ive made in the past few months even with mia guiding me step by step its not a good time to bring her name up ripley leaned over again began to eat as if the food would ease the clenching in her stomach if she hadnt brought him here she didnt bring him ripley the faint but unmistakable edge of impatience in nells voice had ripley hunching her shoulders and if she hadnt rented him the cottage hed have found another or stayed at the hotel did it ever occur to you that by renting him her cottage by agreeing to talk to him she controls the situation to an extent that she couldnt otherwise ripley opened her mouth shut it again no it didnt it should have she never misses a trick im going to talk to him too the spoon clattered into the bowl thats just a bad idea allround bad idea ive thought about it hes promised mia that he wont use real names without permission im interested in his work she continued scooping cookies off the tray and onto the cooling rack id like to know more about it myself i dont have the same feelings for what i am as you do i cant tell you what to do but ripley would make certain mac didnt push too hard or in the wrong direction how does zack feel about it hes left it up to me he trusts me respects me thats every bit as wonderful as knowing he loves me im not worried about dr booke hes sneakier than he looks ripley muttered he sort of lulls you into thinking hes like this harmless puppy dog but hes not what is he smart slick oh hes got those puppydog qualities in there and the combination throws you off one minute hes looking around with that lost look wondering where he put his head last time he took it off and the next nell sat again and the next he kissed me nells fingertips tapped together before she laced them really it was supposed to be like a joke guy has to walk you to the door like youre coming back from prom night then he just sort of she trailed off as she tried to mime the way his arms had slid around her and you know reeled me in taking his time about it and everything got blurry and hot then it was like being gulped down slow oh my i didnt have any bones left so i was just like fused against him while hes doing all these incredible things to my mouth she blew out a breath sucked another in ive kissed a lot of men and im damn good at it but i couldnt keep up wow well nell scooted her chair an inch closer what happened next i walked into the door ripley cringed it was mortifying i walked right into the door blap and dr romeo just politely opens it for me its the first time a kiss ever made me feel like an idiot and its going to be the last if youre attracted to him hes cute hes built hes sexy of course im attracted to him ripley gave a quick shake of her head but thats not the issue he shouldnt have been able to dissolve my brain with one kiss the problem is i havent been going out in a while its been more than four months since i had you know ripley nell gave a quick laugh i figure this was just like i dont know spontaneous combustion or something hes got good moves boom now that i know whats up i can handle it feeling better she polished off the oatmeal i can handle him mac browsed the bookstore flipping pages scanning covers hed already acquired and read material on three sisters but there were a couple of books here hed yet to come across he tucked them under his arm and continued to wander the store had a nice eclectic selection he found a pretty volume of elizabeth barrett brownings sonnets from the portuguese the latest in a vampire hunter series he liked two books on local sites flora and fauna and a handbook for solitary witches and two other books on the paranormal to replace those hed misplaced somewhere then there was a really cool arthurian tarot deck not that he collected them or anything never one to miss an opportunity to indulge in books he took them all they would he thought entertain him in his free time and give him the opening he wanted to talk to lulu he carried the books to the checkout counter offered his most innocent smile terrific bookstore you dont expect to see this kind of selection in a small town lots of things around here people dont expect lulu glared at him over the top of her glasses to let him know shed yet to make up her mind about him cash or charge uh charge he dug out his wallet tilted his head to see the title of the book shed been reading serial killers their hearts their minds oh boy hows the book too much psychobabble not enough blood intellectual types dont cut much mustard a lot of intellectual types dont get out in the world enough too much classroom not enough fieldwork he leaned companionably on the counter as if she were handing him roses instead of thorns did you know one theory is jack the ripper had preternatural powers and while his period in london was the first documented case of serial killing hed lived before and killed before in rome gaul brittany she continued to watch him over the top of her glasses as she rang up the books i dont hold with that me either but it makes a good story the ripper murder through time the way i read it he was the first to use the hornless goat human sacrifice he explained when lulus eyes narrowed in ritual magic black magic very black is that what youre looking for around here blood sacrifices no maam wicca uses no blood sacrifice the white witch harms none lulu dont call me maam she sniffed at him pretty clever arent you yeah sometimes it irritates people youre barking up the wrong tree with me pretty boy im not a witch no you just raised one it mustve been interesting watching mia grow up and ripley he began to shuffle his purchases idly theyre about the same age arent they yes she thought very clever boy what of it you know how it is with intellectual types were full of questions id like to interview you if mia doesnt mind caution warred with delight what for call it human interest most people dont understand the ordinary the everyday pattern of an extraordinary woman even if they open their minds to the extraordinary they tend to think theres no usual no simple no math homework or getting grounded for coming in after curfew or having someones shoulder to lean on lulu swiped the credit card he handed her have you got personal designs on mia no but i sure like looking at her i dont have time to talk to some college boy for his term paper mac signed the credit slip without lulu noted looking at the total ill pay you she heard the faint sound caching in the back of her mind how much fifty an hour what are you stupid no loaded shaking her head lulu handed him his sack of books ill think about it okay thanks when he walked out she shook her head again pay her to talk could you beat that she was still wondering over it when mia glided down the stairs too quiet in here today lu i think im going to run a cookbook sale upstairs get people in nell could make some samples from some of the books whatever college boy was just in who oh mia handed lulu the cup of tea shed brought her from the café the interesting and yummy macallister booke shelled out over a hundred fifty for books without batting an eye mias businesswomans heart went pittypat bless him looks like he can afford it he offered me fifty an hour to talk to him really sipping her own tea mia lifted an eyebrow she knew lulu had an ongoing love affair with profit an affection shed learned at lulus knobby knee i shouldve charged him more rent what does he want to talk to you about you said it was like human interest how many times i had to swat your butt when you were growing up that sort of thing i dont think we need refer back to the unfortunate incidents of buttswatting mia said dryly but this is interesting and unexpected id thought hed be pestering and pressuring me to discuss and demonstrate instead hes letting all that sit to one side and offering you a consultant fee to discuss my formative years she tapped a fingertip on her bottom lip both were painted bold red very clever of him he admitted he was and that it irritated some people im not irritated im intrigued which is just what hed hoped for i imagine claims he doesnt have any designs on you of a personal nature now im insulted with a laugh mia kissed lulus cheek still watching out for me you could do worse than take a look in his direction hes polite rich and has brains and hes not tough to look at hes not for me with a little sigh she rested her cheek on lulus hair id know if he was lulu started to speak then kept her tongue still hooked an arm around mias waist im not thinking of samuel logan mia said though she had been the only man whod ever held her heart the only man whod ever crushed it im just not romantically attracted to the interesting clever and yummy dr booke are you going to talk to him depends if youre worried that i have an objection i dont i can protect myself if i need protecting and i wont not from him there was something else something not quite clear that slithered around the edges of home but it didnt come from macallister booke she drew away picked up her tea again in fact i may agree to talk to him myself fifty dollars an hour she let out a low delighted laugh fascinating loaded down with portable equipment mac plowed through the snow piled on the floor of the narrow forest beside his cottage the police report and the newspaper stories hed read cited this as the place nell had run to when evan remington attacked her and zack todd hed already completed scans of the kitchen area the site of the attack hed found no negative energy there no remnants of violence which had surprised him until hed reasoned out that either nell or mia would have cleansed the house he hoped to find something in the woods the air was still and cold ice gleamed on the dark trunks and branches of trees snow lay on them like fur he saw and was charmed by what he recognized as deer tracks and automatically checked his camera to be certain hed loaded film he passed a little brook where trickles of water forced their way over rocks and ice though his gauges didnt register any anomaly he felt something it took him a moment to realize it was simply peace simply pleasure a bird called flashed by like a bullet mac just stood happy and content it felt good here he thought a place where the mind could be quiet a place for picnics or contemplation with some reluctance he continued to walk but promised himself he would come back and just enjoy he wandered and though he hated to spoil the mood he tried to imagine what it had been like to run fleeing in the dark from a man bent on violence a man armed with a knife already bloody bastard he thought the bastard had hunted her down a rabid wolf after a doe because he could because he would rather have seen her dead than free of him prepared to swipe the knife over her throat rather than lose what he considered his possession fury raged in him hot roiling fury he could almost smell the blood the hate the fear steeped in it he needed several moments to realize that his sensors were going wild jesus he jolted back shook himself and was abruptly the coolheaded scientist again here right here he swept with scanners dragging out his tape recorder muttering data into it he paced off the area using another gauge to measure distance radius diameter down on his knees in the snow he recorded calculated documented considered while the numbers and needles on his tools swung wildly highest charge almost pure positive energy encompasses an area of twelve feet in a perfect circle most rites of paranormal origin involve protective circles this is the most powerful ive found pocketing his tools he used his hands to dig to clear a light sweat covered his back before he uncovered a reasonable portion of the energy circle there are no markings under the snow no symbols ill need to come back with a shovel to clear the entire circle if this was made on the night evan remington was arrested it was cast more than two months ago and would have been ritualistically closed on that same night yet there is a positive echo registering a steady sixpointtwo on my scale sixpointtwo his mind leaped at the data hot dog my previous experience with an active circle during an initiation rite registered no more than fiveeight check those data he got to his feet again snow clinging everywhere as he took photographs he dropped his tape recorder cursed and spent some time scooping it out of a pile of snow then worrying that hed damaged it but nothing could diminish the thrill he stood in the silent wood and wondered if he had stumbled across the heart of the sisters an hour later without bothering to go back to the cottage mac was trudging along the snowy beach the tide had moved in moved out and swallowed some of the snow with it but the damp and the cold had packed what remained like bricks in a wall the air was far from still here shivering in from the sea in icy streams despite the layers he wore his fingers and toes were beginning to feel it he thought idly about a steaminghot shower steaminghot coffee as he examined the area where he remembered seeing the woman on his first night on the island what the hell are you doing he looked up and saw ripley standing at the seawall and was mildly embarrassed that looking at her turned his thoughts immediately to steaminghot sex working how about you she set her hands on her hips he couldnt see her eyes as she wore dark glasses it made him wish hed remembered his own for the sun bouncing off the snow was blinding working at what becoming the abominable snowman the yeti isnt indigenous to this part of the world take a look at yourself booke he did glancing down he was indeed covered with snow it was he knew going to be a damn mess when he peeled everything off for that shower i guess im really into my work he shrugged since it didnt appear that she would come to him he started toward her it wasnt an easy process and he managed to find a couple of snowdrifts that hit above his knees but he trudged to the seawall hitched himself up on it and caught his breath ever hear of frostbite she said dryly i can still feel my toes but thanks for thinking of me how about some coffee i dont happen to have any on me buy you a cup im working maybe i do have frostbite he turned his head and sent her a soulful look wouldnt it be your duty as a civil servant to assist me to a warm and sheltered location no but ill call the health clinic okay strike one he swung over the wall remembering in the nick of time to protect his dangling camera and stood beside her where are you headed why i thought wherever it was thered be coffee she sighed he looked frozen and ridiculously adorable all right come on im heading in anyway didnt see you at the gym this morning i got a late start didnt see you around the village either youre seeing me now she had a long stride he noted he barely had to check his to keep pace with her she stopped in front of the station house took a good look at him stomp that snow off your boots he obeyed sent a little flurry of snow from his coat and pants oh for gods sake turn around she slapped and brushed at the snow that clung to him scowling as she worked her way around to the front then her eyes flicked up caught his grin what are you smiling at maybe i just like being handled want me to do you youll watch your step if you want that coffee she shoved the door open and was bitterly disappointed that zack wasnt in she peeled off her gloves her coat unwinding her neck scarf as he did the same what the hell were you doing crawling around in the snow do you really want to know i guess i dont she walked to the coffeepot poured the last of the thick brew into two cups ill tell you anyway i was in the woods earlier and found the area where you dealt with remington that night her stomach did a quick jerk and clench a sensation he seemed to cause regularly how do you know you found it he took the coffee she held out its my job to know you closed the circle didnt you talk to mia about that just yes or no its not a hard choice yes curiosity needled her why because theres an energy echo unprecedented in my experience strong magic like i said thats mias area patiently he blew on the hot coffee is there a specific reason the two of you dont get along or is it more general its specific and general and none of your business okay he sipped it tasted like hot mud but hed had worse want to have dinner tonight yes i do and i plan to his lips twitched i meant with me then no its going to be hard to work my way around to kissing you good night again if we dont have dinner first she leaned on the little table that held the coffeepot that was a onetime deal you might change your mind after we split a pizza she was already changing her mind just looking at him whetted her appetite are you as good with the rest of the routine as you are with kissing now how am i supposed to answer that without sounding like an idiot good point lets say ill think about splitting a pizza at some later date if and when that event occurs your work as it involves me is off the table i can agree to that he held out a hand she considered ignoring it but it seemed cowardly she clasped his hand shook and felt great relief that there was nothing there but the casual meeting of palms but he didnt let go this is really terrible coffee he said i know what was happening now was completely natural she told herself that stirring of the blood woman for man the anticipatory thrill the memory of just what that mouth of his was capable of oh hell she moved into him do it i was hoping youd say that he set his coffee down this time he took her face a light framing with his hands a slight skim of fingers that made her skin hum his mouth touched hers sank in and sent her brain tumbling oh man man you are really good at this thanks he slid one hand to the base of her neck now be quiet okay im trying to concentrate she linked her arms around his waist plastered herself against him and enjoyed through her lashes she saw that his eyes were open focused on her it made her feel like the only woman in the world another first shed never needed that from a man but being given it was a silky stroke the fingers at the base of her neck began to knead lightly softly finding odd little points she hadnt known existed he changed the angle of the kiss as if experimenting and toppled her from pleasure to need she nearly crawled over him crawled into him her heart rate bounded her blood flashed he held her there a moment had to hold her there trembling until he found his own balance again and drew her away with hands that were no longer steady okay she sucked in a breath wow ive got to give it to you what did you study exotic sexual techniques or something actually he cleared his throat he really really needed to sit down in a manner of speaking and merely as an offshoot of research she stared at him i dont think youre kidding sexual rites and customs are often an important part of why dont i just show you uhuh she held up a hand to ward him off im on duty and youve already managed to get me stirred up enough ill let you know if and when im ready for that pizza give me five minutes and youll be ready he stepped forward until her palm met his chest no deal put your coat back on and go away for a moment she didnt think he was going to do as she asked then like magic he stepped back when the time comes i like my pizza large and loaded funny so do i that keeps it simple he dragged on his coat picked up his camera it was nice running into you deputy todd thanks for the coffee were here to serve dr booke outside he pulled on his ski cap he would go back to the beach he decided throw himself bodily into the icy water if he didnt drown he would cool off six it took a lot of fast talk a lot of grease for a lot of palms and the tenacity of a bulldog but jonathan q harding was willing to invest all of those elements when it came to a hot story his instincts which he considered the best in the business told him that evan remington was going to be his funnel to the story of the decade not just the sizzle of scandal that was still shooting out a few sparks all the angles on remington himself how he had hidden that violent face from the world from his fancy hollywood clients from the upper crust of society had been done to death as far as harding was concerned even most of the details on how his pretty young wife had escaped him risked her life to get free of his abuse and his threats were common fodder now harding didnt bother with the common hed dug around a bit and he had enough confirmed information on where shed run how shed run where shed worked lived during the first eight months after shed ditched her mercedes over a cliff it was decent stuff the former society wife the pampered princess living in cheap furnished rooms working as a shortorder cook or a waitress moving from town to town dyeing her hair changing her name he could get some ink out of it but it was the period of time from after shed landed on that bump of land out in the atlantic to when remington had been dragged into a cell that had his nose twitching things just didnt add up there not tidily enough for harding to close the book or maybe it was just too tidy remington tracks her down pure coincidence knocks her around enter the hero the local sheriff and new love interest got himself stabbed for his trouble harding thought now but he kept on riding to the rescue took remington into custody in the woods talking him out of slitting the pretty heroines throat hauled him to jail and got himself sewed up good boy saves girl bad boy goes into a padded cell good boy marries girl happy days that story with all its angles had been fourwalled in the media for weeks after remingtons arrest and had as most did pretty much petered out but thered been whispers the kind no one could confirm that more had gone on in the woods that night than an inthenickoftime arrest whispers of witchcraft of magic harding had been willing to dismiss that idea maybe play on the angle for a few column inches but just for the novelty after all remington was a raving lunatic his statement about that night which harding had paid good money for could hardly be taken without a truckload of salt and yet dr macallister booke the indiana jones of the paranormal had taken up temporary residence on three sisters island didnt that prick up the ears booke wasnt one to waste his time harding knew the man hacked his way through jungles hiked over miles of desert climbed mountains to do research in his unlikely chosen field and mostly on his own nickel of which he had plenty but he didnt waste his time he debunked more socalled magic than he verified but when he verified people tended to listen smart people if there wasnt something to those whispers why would he have gone helen remington excuse me nell channing todd wasnt making any claims shed spoken to the police of course but there was no mention of witchcraft phenomena in her statement none in the press release funneled through her attorneys either but macallister booke had deemed three sisters worth his time and that interested harding interested him enough that hed read up on the island its lore its legends himself and his reporters nose had scented a story a big fat and potentially juicy story hed tried unsuccessfully to pry interviews out of mac before the macallisterbookes were eyecrossing rich influential and staunchly conservative with a little cooperation he could have generated a series of solid features on the family and their spookchasing son but nobody particularly booke himself cooperated and that stung still it was just a matter of finding the right crowbar and knowing the correct amount of pressure to apply harding was confident that remington himself would help him ease the lid off after that he could take care of the rest harding walked down the corridor of what he thought of as the loony bin remington had been judged legally insane which had saved the taxpayers the cost of a long detailed trial and cheated them out of the meaty morsels the media could have dispensed had there been one the fact was the weapon used against the island sheriff had remingtons fingerprints on it the sheriff and two witnesses including the islands deputy had given statements that remington had held that knife to his wifes throat and had threatened her life even more damning remington hadnt simply confessed hed screamed about murdering her babbled about till death do us part and carried on about the need to burn the adulterous witch of course hed screamed about a lot of other things too about glowing eyes blue lightning snakes crawling under his skin between the physical evidence the witness statements and his own rantings remington had copped himself a room in the barred and guarded section of the nuthouse hardings visitors badge flapped on the lapel of his tailored suit jacket his tie the exact shade of charcoal as the suit was perfectly knotted his hair was dark shot with silver and meticulously cut to suit his square ruddy face his features were blocky and his eyes a dark brown tended to vanish when he smiled his mouth was thin and when annoyed he appeared to be lipless if his face and his speaking voice had been marginally more appealing he might have wormed his way into television news hed once wanted that the way some boys want that first touch of female breast lustfully gleefully but the camera was not his friend it accented his features and made his short stocky build resemble a tree stump his voice as some smartmouthed tech had once told him sounded like a wounded goose when miked the cruel loss of that childhood dream had helped turn harding into the kind of print reporter he was today ruthless and icebergcold he listened to the echo of locks being released heavy doors opening he would remember to describe them when he wrote of this visit of the eerie clang of metal on metal the impassive faces of the guards and medical staff the oddly sweet smell of madness he waited outside yet another room there was a final check here an attendant beside the door with a bank of monitors on his desk the inmates in this section harding had been told were under twentyfourhour surveillance when he stepped in with remington he himself would be watched as well that was he admitted a comfort the last door was opened harding was reminded he had thirty minutes he intended to make the most of it evan remington didnt look like the man harding was used to seeing in the glossy pages of magazines or in sparkling color on the television screen he sat in a chair dressed in a violently orange coverall his posture rulerstraight there were restraints on his wrists his hair once a golden crown was dull yellow and cut short his handsome face was puffy now from the institutional food from medication from lack of salon treatments the mouth was slack the eyes dead as a dolls they had him sedated harding imagined take your average sociopath toss in a few psychoses and violent tendencies and drugs were everyones best friend but he hadnt counted on trying to wend his way through the chemical maze to remingtons brain there was a guard at the door to remingtons back who was already looking bored harding sat on his side of the counter looked between the bars mr remington im harding jonathan q harding i believe you were expecting me today there was no response harding cursed inwardly couldnt they have waited to give him his zoning pills until after the interview i spoke with your sister yesterday mr remington nothing barbara your sister a thin line of drool slid out the corner of remingtons mouth fastidiously harding looked away from it i was hoping to talk to you about your exwife about what happened on three sisters the night you were arrested i work for first magazine or he did for the moment his editors were becoming entirely too delicate and pennypinching for his taste i want to do a story on you mr remington to tell your side your sister is eager for you to talk to me that wasnt entirely true but he had convinced her that an interview might lead to a sympathetic story which might in turn give weight to her legal action to have her brother moved to a private facility i might be able to help you mr remington evan he corrected i want to help you he got nothing but that dead and silent stare and the sheer emptiness of it scuttled along his skin im planning to talk to everyone involved to get a fully rounded story im going to talk to your exwife im going to arrange to interview helen at the sound of the name the dark dull eyes flickered someones at home after all harding thought and edged slightly forward is there anything youd like me to tell helen for you any message i can take to helen helen the voice was raspy hardly more than a whisper harding told himself that was why a cold finger tickled down his spine at the sound of it thats right helen im going to see helen very soon i killed her the slack mouth bowed up into a stunning and brilliant smile in the woods in the dark i kill her every night because she keeps coming back she keeps laughing at me so i kill her what happened that night in the woods with helen she ran from me shes mad you know why else would she run would she think she could get away i had to kill her her eyes burned blue lightning did they burn like blue lightning it wasnt helen remingtons eyes darted black birds on the wing helen was quiet and obedient she knew who was in charge she knew as he spoke his fingers began to scrabble on the arms of the chair who was it a witch came out of hell all of them so much light so much light they blinded me they cursed me snakes under my skin snakes circle of light circle of blood can you see it for a moment he could clear as glass and terrifying harding had to force back a shudder who are all of them theyre all helen he began to laugh a high keening sound that shivered along hardings skin until the fine hairs on his arm stood up all helen burn the witch i kill her every night every night but she comes back he was screaming now so that harding whod seen his share of horrors pushed away leaped up even as the guard surged forward a lunatic harding told himself as attendants hustled him out of the room mad as a hatter but but the smell of the story was too strong to resist some people might have been nervous at the prospect of spending an evening in the home of a witch being nervous they might have stocked up on wolfsbane or carried a pocket full of salt mac went armed with his tape recorder and notebook and a bottle of good cabernet hed waited patiently through his first week on the island hoping for this initial invitation he was about to dine with mia devlin it hadnt been easy to resist driving up to her house on his own hiking through her woods poking around in the shadows of the lighthouse but that would have been by his standards rude patience and courtesy had paid off and shed casually asked him if he would like to come up for dinner hed accepted just as casually now as he drove up the coast road he was filled with anticipation there was so much he wanted to ask her particularly since ripley shut down each time he tried to question her he had yet to approach nell two warnings by two witches made a definite point he would wait there until nell came to him or the path was cleared there was plenty of time and he still had that ace in the hole he liked the look of her place the old stone high on the cliff standing against time and the sea the art of the gables the romance of the widows walk the mystery of the turrets the white beam from the lighthouse cut through the dark like a wide blade swept over sea the stone house the dark stand of trees it was a lonely spot he thought as he parked almost arrogantly alone and undeniably beautiful it suited her perfectly the snow had been neatly cleared from her drive from her walk he couldnt imagine any woman who looked like mia devlin hoisting a snow shovel he wondered if that was a sexist opinion he decided it wasnt it had nothing to do with her being a woman and everything to do with beauty he simply couldnt imagine her doing anything that wasnt elegant the minute she opened the door he was certain that he was right she wore a dress of deep forest green the sort that covered a woman from neck to toe and still managed to tell a man that everything under it was perfect was fascinating stones glittered at her ears on her fingers on a braided silver chain a single carved disk glinted almost at her waist her feet were seductively bare she smiled held out a hand im glad you could come and bearing gifts she accepted the bottle of wine it was her favorite she noted how did you know huh oh the wine its my job to dig up pertinent data with a laugh she drew him inside welcome to my home let me take your coat she stood close let her fingertips graze his arm she considered it a kind of test for both of them im tempted to say come into my parlor her laugh came again low and rich so i will she gestured to a room off the wide foyer make yourself comfortable ill open the wine slightly dazed he walked into a large room where a fire burned brightly the room was full of rich color soft fabrics gleaming wood and glass old beautifully faded rugs were spread over a wideplanked floor he recognized wealth comfortable tasteful and somehow female wealth there were flowers lilies with starshaped petals as white as the snow outside in a tall clear vase the air smelled of them and of her even a dead man mac imagined would have felt his blood warming his juices flowing there were books tucked on shelves among pretty bottles and chunks of crystals and intriguing little statues he gave those his attention what a person read gave insight into the person im a practical woman he jumped shed come in silently like smoke excuse me practical she repeated setting down the tray that held the wine and two glasses books are a passion and i opened the store so i could make a profit from my passion your passions eclectic single channels are so monotonous she poured the wine crossed to him her eyes never leaving his youd agree since your interests are varied as well yes thanks to a variety of passions then her eyes laughed as she touched her glass to his she sat on the low sofa smiling still as she patted the cushion beside her come sit tell me what you think of our little island in the sea he wondered if the room was overwarm or if she simply radiated heat wherever she went but he sat i like it the village is just quaint enough without being trite and the people friendly enough without being obviously nosy your bookstore adds a touch of sophistication and the sea adds glamour the forests mystery im comfortable here handy and youre comfortable in my little cottage more than ive gotten considerable work done already youre a practical soul too arent you macallister she sipped red wine against red lips despite what many would consider the impracticality of your chosen field it felt as though the collar of his shirt had shrunk knowledge is always practical and thats what you seek under it all the knowing she curled up and her knees brushed his leg lightly a seeking mind is very attractive yeah well he drank wine gulped it hows your appetite his color rose my appetite he was she decided absolutely delightful why dont we move into the dining room ill feed you great good she uncurled trailed fingertips down his arm again bring the wine handsome oh boy was his only clear thought the dining room should have felt formal intimidating with its huge mahogany table the wide sideboards and highbacked chairs but it was as welcoming as her parlor the colors were warm here too deep burgundy shades mixed with dark golds flowers in the same hues scented this air as well and speared out of cut crystal a fire crackled like an accompaniment to the quiet music of harps and pipes the trio of windows along the wall was left uncovered to bring the contrast of black night and white snow into the room perfect as a photograph there was a succulent rack of lamb and the light of a dozen candles if shed been intending to dress a stage for romance she had succeeded expertly as they ate she steered the conversation into literature art theater all the while watching him with flattering attention it was almost he thought hypnotic the way she looked at a man fully directly deeply candlelight played over her skin like gold on alabaster in her eyes like gilt over smoke he wished he could do better than rough pencil sketches hers was a face that demanded oil and canvas it surprised him that they had so much common ground books enjoyed music appreciated then again each of them had spent considerable time learning of the others background he knew shed grown up here in this house an only child and that her parents had given most of her daytoday care into lulus hands shed gone to college at radcliffe and had earned degrees in literature and business her parents had left the island before shed graduated and rarely returned she came from money as did he she belonged to no coven no group no organization and lived quietly and alone in the place of her birth she had never married nor had she ever lived with a man he wondered that a woman so obviously so elegantly sexual had not done so you enjoy traveling she said theres a lot out there to see i guess i enjoyed it more in my twenties the kick of packing up taking off whenever i wanted or needed to and living in new york the excitement the stimulation it has its advantages but my work can be done anywhere do you get to new york often no i rarely leave the island i have all i need and want here museums theater galleries i dont have much of a thirst for them i prefer my cliffs my forest my work and my garden she added its a pity its winter or we could take a stroll through my garden instead well have to settle for coffee and dessert in the parlor she treated him to delicate profiteroles which he enjoyed offered him brandy which he declined a clock from somewhere deep in the house bonged the hour as she once again curled herself on the sofa beside him youre a man of great personal restraint and willpower arent you dr booke im not sure thats ever come up why because youve been in my home alone with me for more than two hours ive plied you with wine candlelight music and yet you havent brought up your professional interest in me nor have you tried to seduce me is that admirable i wonder or should i be insulted i thought about both those things really and what did you think that you invited me into your home so to bring up my professional interest was inappropriate ah she tilted her head deliberately giving him the opening to lean in take her mouth and the seduction if theres a man whos been within a half a mile of you and hasnt imagined seducing you he needs therapy immediately oh i do like you more than id counted on actually now ill apologize for baiting you why i liked it mac she leaned over touched her lips lightly to his were going to be friends arent we i hope so i might have enjoyed being more but it would have been brief and it would have complicated destinies yours or mine both and more were not meant to be lovers i didnt know youd already realized that i hope you dont mind if i regret it a little id be annoyed if you didnt she tossed back her curling flood of darkred hair ask the professional question thats most on your mind ill answer if i can the circle in the woods by the cottage how did you cast it surprise had her pursing her lips she rose to give herself a moment to think thats a good one she said wandering to the window how did you find it before he could answer she waved a hand no never mind its your job i cant answer a question that involves others who may not wish it i know about ripley and nell she glanced back over her shoulder do you from research process of elimination observation he shrugged his shoulders from being good at what i do i havent approached nell because both you and ripley objected i see are you afraid what wed do if you ignored our objections no no just that simple and quick a courageous man not at all you wouldnt use your gift to punish or harm not without cause or provocation and then only to protect ripley doesnt have your control or dedication but she has her own code possibly more strict than yours you read people well and youve approached ripley youve spoken to her yes i have the corners of her mouth bowed up but there was little humor in the smile and you say youre not courageous there was enough bite to the words to intrigue what happened between the two of you thats a second question and ive yet to decide if ill answer the first until ripley confirms your supposition its not a supposition its fact and she has confirmed it now you surprise me puzzling it out mia paced to the fireplace from there to the coffeepot to pour though she had no desire for coffee youd protect her too mac said quietly she matters to you a great deal we were friends as close as friends can be for most of our lives now were not she said it simply though it was anything but simple but i havent forgotten what we were or what we shared even so ripley can protect herself i cant think why shed have admitted to you so quickly what she has what she is i boxed her in he hesitated only a moment then told mia of the energy burst the woman on the beach the hour hed spent with ripley in the cottage mia took his wrist examined it herself her temper was always a problem but her conscience is even stronger shell suffer for having harmed you shed have transferred the burns you know pardon that would have been her way to do penance to make it right and just again taking the burns from your flesh onto her own he thought of the heat the pain swore damn it that wasnt necessary for her it was let it go she released his wrist wandered about the room and settled her mind you want her sexually he shifted on the sofa the blush wanted to creep up his neck im not entirely comfortable getting into that subject with another woman men are so often squeamish about sex discussing it not having it thats all right she came back sat again now to answer your question im sorry would you object if i recorded your answer dr booke amusement sang in her voice as he took the little tape recorder out of his pocket such a boy scout always prepared no i dont suppose id object but well just put it on record as well that this goes into no publication without my written permission youre a boy scout yourself agreed nell had taken precautions and so had i legal action was about to begin as further protection zack who is also good at his job and very much in love with nell was also protecting her yet evan remington came to the island and he found her he hurt her and terrorized her he nearly killed zack and would have killed nell despite everything he would have taken her life that night she ran to the woods to keep him from killing zack who was already wounded ran there knowing he would follow her shes a courageous woman oh indeed she knew the woods theyre hers and it was the dark of the moon yet still he found her as part of her knew he would there are fates that nothing can turn no magic no intellect no effort her eyes were deep and intense as they met his now do you believe that yes i do she nodded as she studied his face i thought you would and on some level you even understand it he was meant to find her this test that held her life in the balance was written centuries ago her courage and faith in self were key she paused a moment gathering herself even knowing that i was afraid as a woman is afraid he held a knife to her throat her face was already bruised from his hand i abhor those who prey on others who deliberately cause fear and pain in those they see as weaker youre a civilized woman he said am i dr booke do you also understand that it was within my power to have caused evan remingtons heart to stop to have stopped his life given him unspeakable pain in the instant he threatened my sister a curse of that magnitude that violence requires the belief of the one being cursed and a complex ritual with he trailed off because mia was sipping coffee and smiling pure amusement now all my research confirms that as you like she said it lightly and the back of his neck prickled what i could have done is one thing im bound by my own beliefs my own vows i cant break faith and be what i am we stood the five of us in that wood both zack and ripley had weapons but using them would certainly have ended nells life as well as remingtons there was only one path one answer the circle of three we cast it that night without the ceremony the tools the chants that are most often required we cast the circle through will fascinating he thought amazing ive never seen that done nor had i until that night ever attempted it needs must she murmured a link mind to mind to mind and power dr booke ran in a ring like fire he couldnt harm her when she would not be harmed he couldnt stay sane when forced to face what lived inside him she spoke quietly but something the word magic seemed almost too ordinary shimmered in the room stroked over his skin ripley told me you closed the circle ripley is uncharacteristically chatty with you yes we closed the circle the energys still there stronger than any open circle ive documented the three are very strong when linked i suspect the energy will be there long after were just memories nell found what she needed the first step toward the balance the air cooled again and she was just a beautiful woman holding a china pot more coffee she asked seven the slickhanded son of a bitch first he puts the moves on her then he worms his way past her better judgment with that cute trustme act then he makes it clear he wants to have sex ripley ground her teeth as she jogged along the beach then then at the first chance he cozies up to mia men she decided were slugs she might not have gotten wind of it either if nell hadnt casually commented about mia having mac up to her house for dinner dinner she snorted right dinner she just bet he had his mind on his stomach when he bought a bottle of mias favorite fancy french wine at island liquors shed heard about that too after the fact hed even asked the clerk which type vintage mia preferred well he was free to put the make on mia and on every female on the island but not when hed put it on ripley todd first bastard cityslicker bastard getting her all stirred up and twitchy then sneaking off to nibble on mia mia had probably cast out lures just to get her goat it would be just like her she swung around at the end of the beach pounded in the opposite direction no damn it it wasnt however much she would have enjoyed jabbing her elbow in mias face on principle she couldnt delude herself mia never went sniffing after someone elses man the fact was she didnt sniff after men at all which was probably why she was such a moody irritating woman a little recreational sex would improve her attitude but it wasnt mias style and however much at odds they were mia devlin was entirely too loyal and too damn classy to poach which brought ripley back full circle to mac his fault completely and totally all she had to do now was figure out the most satisfying way to make him pay for it she finished her run showered dressed for the day in dark wool slacks and a turtleneck buttoning a flannel shirt over it she laced up her boots then took a good long look at herself in the mirror she could never compete with mia in the looks department who could then again shed never wanted to she had her own style and was comfortable with it still she knew just how to bump up the package when she was in the mood toying with the outline of an idea for vengeance she slicked on lipstick smudged on eyeliner and shadow brushed on mascara satisfied that shed made the best use of what she had to work with she sprayed on some of the perfume nell had put in her christmas stocking it was a deep earthy scent and suited her more than anything floral or airy after some debate she ditched the flannel shirt she might be a bit chilly before end of day but the turtleneck and slacks showed off her curves pleased with the results she strapped her holster to her belt and headed out to work pete stahrs mutt had gotten off the leash again hed nosed out a goodly pile of frozen fish guts feasted on same then had sicked them up along with his morning ration of kibble on gladys maceys pristine front stoop it was the sort of neighborhood crisis ripley preferred leaving to zack he was more diplomatic more patient but zack was on the windward side helping to deal with a couple of downed trees that left her stuck ripley im at the end of my patience i dont blame you for that mrs macey they stood hunched against the cold and several steps downwind from the mess on the front stoop that dog she pointed to where the unrepentant hound sat tied to a tree trunk by a length of clothesline hes got no more sense than a block of wood no arguing there either ripley watched the dopeyfaced dog grin and loll his tongue but you know hes affable gladys merely puffed her cheeks full of air blew it out why hes taken such a shine to me i dont know but the fact is every blessed time he gets loose hes over here doing his business in my yard burying some mangy bone in my flower beds and now this she set her hands on her hips and scowled at her stoop just whos going to clean up that awful mess if youre willing to wait ill see that pete does it its coming up to lunchtime and ill root him out and make him come over and deal with it gladys sniffed nodded sharply justice she thought was justice and the todds usually found a way to meet it i want it done soon and i want it done right ill see to that petes going to get slapped with a fine too gladys folded her lips been fined before yes maam he has okay ripley thought what would zack do the dog was harmless puppyfriendly and dumb as a turnip his major flaw was his obsession with dead fish parts which he either joyfully rolled in or greedily consumed each with revolting results as inspiration struck ripley hardened her face the fact is that dogs a public nuisance and petes been warned she tapped her fingers on the butt of her weapon well have to impound the dog this time well i should think gladys trailed off blinked what do you mean impound dont you worry about that mrs macey well take care of the dog he wont be coming around your yard to do any kind of mischief in the future the little clutch in gladyss throat had her voice quavering now wait just a minute as ripley had counted on gladys gripped her arm do you mean to take that dog in and and have it put down he cant be controlled ripley let the sentence and its implication hang the dog cooperated by sending out a pitiful whine ripley todd im ashamed of you for suggesting such a thing im not having it not for a minute now mrs macey dont you mrs macey me incensed she wagged her finger in ripleys face thats the most heartless thing ive ever heard putting that harmless dog down just because hes stupid but you said i said he pooped in my yard gladys waved her arms currently covered in the shockingpink wool of her sweater what are you going to do pull that gun and put a bullet in his ear no i oh i cant even talk to you right now you go on and you leave that dog be i want my stoop cleaned and thats the end of it yes maam ripley hung her head let her shoulders droop as she walked away and winked at the dog zack she decided couldnt have done it any better she tracked down pete read him the riot act he would go without lunch the macey stoop would sparkle and the dog who already laid claim to a snazzy red doghouse complete with a heated blanket would get a stronger chain to keep him on the stahr property when no one was home and that ripley thought would likely wrap up the keeping of the peace of three sisters island for the day on her way back to the station house she spotted a small figure climbing through the firstfloor window of a clapboard saltbox okay she decided with her hands on her hips maybe there was a bit more peace to be kept her brows lifted then knit it was the home of one of her cousins and the bright blue jacket on the b and e man was very familiar dennis andrew ripley what the hell do you think youre doing she heard his yowl of pain when he bumped his head on the window and felt no sympathy he was twelve and any boy of twelve who didnt own a hard head should in her opinion develop one he went still for a moment half in half out battlescarred hightops dangling then slowly he wiggled to the ground his hair was pale blond and stuck out in tufts around his ski cap freckles exploded over his face and stood out in sharp relief against his bright flush ah hi aunt ripley he said innocently he was ripley thought with admiration an operator thats deputy todd to you you little weasel whatre you doing crawling in the window um i dont have a key dennis well i dont mom and some of her lady friends went over to the mainland to shop and stuff she mustve locked the door lets try the question this way why are you crawling in the window of your own house instead of sitting at your desk at school because im sick he answered hopefully is that so come on then ill take you over to the clinic right now your mother has her cell phone doesnt she well just give her a call and let her know her sweet baby boys feeling poorly i bet shell come home on the next ferry ripley had the satisfaction of watching his face blanch dont call her okay please im feeling a lot better it musta been something i ate is all i just bet spill it kiddo and if you try to bullshit me again im hauling you to the clinic and telling them to get out their biggest dullest needle were having a history test he blurted out and talked very fast now historys the pits aunt rip its all about dead people anyway so you know who cares and its like european history crap and we dont even live there i mean hey do you know the capital of liechtenstein didnt study did you he shifted from foot to foot jeez what was it with boys and their big clown feet she wondered and attempted a pitiful look from under his lashes i guess maybe not so you decided to blow off the test and hook school just one stupid day i could take the test later i was going to hang out in the woods today and study he added with quick inspiration but its too cold so you were going to go inside and study um yeah yeah i was going to hit the books couldnt you just pretend you didnt see me no aw aunt rip he sighed recognizing the look on her face deputy todd she hooked him by the ear youre getting a police escort to school moms going to kill me thats right im going to fail the test shouldve studied for it ill get inschool suspension kid youre breaking my heart when he muttered shit under his breath she gave the back of his head a quick tap watch the mouth peewee were going to pay a visit to the assistant principal youll make a full confession and take your lumps like you never hooked school when i did i had enough brains not to get caught therein young skywalker is the power of the force he snorted out a laugh and because he did because he was hers she walked him the rest of the way to judgment with her arm companionably around his shoulders the mornings work and her replay of both incidents for zack put her in a much better frame of mind she strolled into the bookstore looking for lunch and gave a quick wave at lulu put your belly on hold a minute and come over here about a minutes all my belly can wait but ripley detoured and walked to the counter whats up i got a letter from jane yeah ripley thought of the cafés former chef she and her man had taken off for new york so he could have a shot at a part in an off broadway play howre they doing well enough sounds to me like they mean to stay lulu glanced toward the stairs lowered her voice guess who strolled big as life into the bakery where janes working harrison ford at lulus steely stare ripley shrugged ive had a thing for him lately okay who sam logan no shit ripleys voice dropped as well what does jane say about him hows he look whats he doing if youd shut up for five seconds ill tell you he looks so jane says better than ever tall dark and dangerous thats jane speaking she got all giddy because he recognized her she never had two licks of sense i dont suppose he said what he was doing or she didnt ask otherwise shed have put every word of it down but she did say he asked after mia what do you mean asked after just that casual according to jane hows mia and and nothing that was it that was all he bought a box of pastries wished jane good luck and walked out again considering ripley pursed her lips juggled the angles in her mind funny coincidence of all the bakeries in all the city he walks into the bakery where mias excook works i dont think it was coincidence i think his curiosity took him there i wont disagree are you going to tell her no lulu sucked air through her nose i thought about it chewed on it twisted it around and i dont see the point are you asking my opinion do you think im telling you all this to give my tongue a workout okay then i agree with you theres no point in it it still hurts her she sighed because it could still hurt just a bit to know that mia hurt besides if mia wanted to know what hes up to she could find out lulu nodded just feels better to have somebody agree with me go eat soups black bean today thatll hit the spot oh lu ripley paused on her way to the stairs if you write jane back tell her not to say anything about this you know already done that ripley told herself was that three good deeds in one day what more could anyone ask she strolled up to the counter started to ring the bell then saw through the kitchen door nell serving soup and a sandwich to mac he was sitting at the kitchen table a place reserved for friends shed taken two long strides toward the end of the counter before she stopped herself this wasnt the way she thought going in guns blazing metaphorically wasnt the way to deal with the man the situation or her own annoyance she gave herself a moment to calm then walked around the counter into the kitchen hi nell mac doing everything she could to radiate goodwill she sniffed the air smells great ill have what hes having okay if i eat back here of course coffee with that nell asked her lets jazz it up and go with a latté ripley unbundled her coat hung it on the back of a chair and sent mac a slow warm smile dont mind a little company do you professor no you look great today thanks she sat across from him whatre you up to i asked him to come back ripley nell squeezed ripleys shoulder before setting down a bowl of soup to talk annoyance clawed up in her throat and was dutifully swallowed if youre all right with it im all right with it actually macs been entertaining me with some stories of his travels and his work its fascinating im going to order those books you recommended nell added tossing him a glance as she made ripleys sandwich i hope youll tell me what you think after youve read them i will she served the sandwich ill get your latté when she was out of earshot mac leaned forward im not pushing her ripley held up a hand truce nells in charge of her own life makes her own decisions you miserable son of a bitch okay but i want you to understand that i know shes been through more than anyone should ever have to go through i wont push whatever the circumstances the fact that she believed him didnt change a thing she ate with him listened to his laugh when she told him about the dog the boy it irritated her to realize she liked talking to him hearing him laugh the man was good company even if he was a slug under other circumstances shed have enjoyed spending time with him getting to know him better finding out all the stuff that went on inside of that highvoltage brain his smarts werent boring shed already figured out that much then there were those terrific brown eyes the long slow smile the really superior body to say nothing of the moves which were past excellent then she imagined him using those moves on mia only hours hours after hed danced with her there was only one recourse he must be annihilated so she said you must be keeping pretty busy hunting spooks and searching for what is it vortexes or whatever busy enough im getting my bearings getting to know the island and the natives she said sweetly sure you know my days still pretty flexible he told her i can wander over to the gym almost anytime id enjoy the workout more with company why dont you ask mia to come sweat with you she thought what time do you usually go over in the morning she knew of course she knew everything that went on under her own damn nose about seventhirty that could work for me in fact she decided it would be perfect she walked into the gym at sevenfortyfive he was already on the stepper and just working up a sweat he hadnt shaved again when he shot her a quick grin she could only think it was too damn bad she had to crush him like a bug he was working out to music instead of tv wasnt it just like him to try to be obliging she set the weight on a leg machine slithered onto the bench on her belly and began to work on her hamstrings the added benefit was to give him a good view of her butt look and dream pal she thought look and dream i heard were in for more snow she counted off reps the skys full of it did you get that wood not yet i lost the name its in your coat pocket it is he looked cute when he was baffled thats where you stuck it after i wrote it down for you right pocket of your long black coat oh nobody seems to be thinking of health and fitness this morning she commented actually there was a guy in here before he finished up right before you came in great legs youve got there deputy todd you think she slid a flirtatious smile onto her face gave him a deliberate onceover yours arent so bad either dr booke you shouldve seen me at eighteen well twenty he corrected any time up to twenty i was the model for the guy who gets sand kicked in his face at the beach skinny were you a toothpick with a sign on his back saying please pick on me there was a little tug of sympathy for the skinny undoubtedly awkward boy remembering her mission she ignored it so you decided to get cut she switched to work her calf muscles a guy with my body type doesnt get cut unless he devotes his life to it i just wanted to get in shape i read up on bodybuilding she couldnt stop the laugh read up on it thats my approach he said with a shrug then i experimented with different programs until i found what i could do obviously amused at himself he grinned over at her i made charts no joke no joke he admitted charts graphs a computer analysis before and after a merging of the intellect and the physical worked for me ill say he flushed a little well it didnt take long to figure out that if i was going to be hiking trails climbing into caves hacking through the occasional jungle id better be able to handle the physical part of the job walk a few miles in a hundred percent humidity carrying a full pack and sensitive equipment you realize youd better put in a few hours a week at the gym whatever the reason the results are fine she rose to change machines and gave him a quick pinch on the butt as she passed when he only stared at her she laughed you can pinch me back anytime cutie she worked her quads pleased to note that shed ruined his rhythm have you taken a tour of the island yet not complete he lost count of his reps and struggled to get his pacing back ive been working more or less inch by inch next time the two of us have a couple of hours free ill show you around he was starting to heat up and it wasnt just the exercise i can be free anytime now thats a dangerous thing to say to a woman i like it she all but purred i like a man willing to take risks she licked her lips have you been thinking about me only ten or twelve times a day ah she wriggled off the bench as he picked up free weights another risky statement not to be outdone ive given you considerable thought as well she walked to the weights but instead of selecting hers skimmed a fingertip over his arm mmm all slicked up arent you me too she shifted closer brushed bodies wouldnt we just slither and slip all over each other right now maybe just maybe if all the blood hadnt drained out of his head hed have caught the hardedged glint to her eyes when she smiled but even the best man often stopped thinking with his brain when a hot sexy willing woman was rubbing herself against him let me put these down he managed before i drop them on my foot or yours i like lean muscles on a man she squeezed his biceps long lean limber the weights clanged like a pair of anvils against the stand he fisted a hand in her hair drew her up had his mouth a breath from hers then her elbow rammed straight into his gut back off he coughed it was the only way his body could gather air what what the hell he was too shocked for anger too busy trying to breathe normally again to do anything but stare into her suddenly furious face you think i want your hands on me he managed the breath rubbed gingerly at his stomach yes well think again nobody juggles me with another woman what the hell are you talking about and dont pull that innocent act maybe you think you can pretend you forget youve been hitting on me when you decide to hit on her and vice versa but thats taking the absentminded professor act one step too far who what she bunched both fists and nearly used them very nearly used them youre not worth it she turned on her heel and stalked into the womens locker room she kicked the wall just because it felt good then limped to her locker she was just about to strip off her sports bra when mac swung in after her you turn around and march straight out of here she ordered otherwise im arresting you for lewd and lascivious behavior he didnt turn he didnt march he stalked seriously surprising her until he stood toetotoe with her im entitled to an explanation of what just went on in there youre not entitled to anything from me now beat it if you think you can sashay in there tease me half to death punch me in the stomach it was an elbow jab and ive never sashayed in my life you deliberately came on to me with the express purpose of slapping me back i want to know why because i dont like cheats i dont like sneaks and i dont like men who try to see how many women they can sleep with at one time especially when theyre trying to add me to the list i havent slept with anyone i havent even gone out with anyone since ive been here lets add i dont like liars to that list he took her firmly by the elbows lifted her straight off her toes i dont lie and dont even think about spitting any magic at me she opened her mouth shut it again when she spoke it was dead calm take your hands off me he set her on her feet took a full step back ive made it clear im interested in you on a personal level it happens that im not interested at the moment in anyone else on that same level i havent juggled anyone i dont have the reflexes for it you bought a bottle of fancy wine and spent an evening snuggled up to mia where the hell do you get this flustered he dragged his hands through his hair i went to mias for dinner though thats completely my business shes one of the main reasons im here thats a professional interest however i also happen to like her very much i didnt sleep with her dont intend to sleep with her fine because shed started feeling like a fool even before hed released her she turned to her locker its your business like you said youre jealous he paused a moment as if to gather his wits or his temper after i get over being seriously pissed off i might find that flattering she whirled back im not jealous replay that little scene he suggested jerking a thumb toward the gym see what you come up with now im going to go soak my head i suggest you do the same he strode out sending the swinging door slapping eight there was one thing ripley hated more than feeling guilty it was feeling ashamed it took her a while to get there as her temper wasnt of the flashandfade variety she wallowed in anger enjoyed the way it bubbled and churned inside her and kept clear rational thinking at bay she rode on that blissful annoyance most of the day and it felt good it felt just the energy it gave her had her whipping through a backlog of paperwork at the station house and taking zacks turn at cleaning the premises she did her patrol on foot then still raring to go volunteered to take her brothers cruise shift she drove all over the island looking for trouble hoping for it when trouble didnt cooperate she spent an hour at home beating the hell out of her punching bag then common sense began to trickle through she hated when that happened that trickle opened a crack and through the crack she was able to view her own behavior with distressing clarity shed been stupid and that was hard to swallow shed been wrong and that was a bigger nastier gulp feeling like an idiot made her depressed so she skulked down to the kitchen when no one was around and ate three of nells brownies she could hardly believe shed worked herself up into that sort of a state over a man in the first place not that it had been jealousy she thought contemplating a fourth brownie he was completely wrong about that but she had overreacted big time and she she decided as the feeling of stupidity began to slide toward the first sticky edge of guilt had treated him shabbily shed teased him she had no respect for women who used sex as a weapon or a bribe or a reward for that matter but shed used it as bait and punishment that shamed her replaying her actions in the gym drove her to brownie number four even if he had been interested in mia which she was now convinced he hadnt been he was a free agent a couple of lip locks with her didnt make them exclusive or oblige him to fidelity though she firmly believed that if you were nibbling on one cookie you finished it off before you picked up another but that was neither here nor there the best thing to do she thought rubbing her now slightly unsettled stomach was nothing stay out of his way nip any personal connection in the bud though it was probably a little late for the bud stage she admitted they would just pretend nothing had ever happened which of course it shouldnt have she crept back up to her bedroom closed herself in and decided it would be wise to avoid all human contact for the next eight hours sleep didnt come easily but she put that down to overdosing on chocolate and deemed it fair punishment for her crimes the dreams when they came seemed harsher than she deserved the winter beach was deserted solitude weighed like chains around her heart the moon was full ripely white so that its light washed over the shore and sea it seemed you could all but count every grain of sand that glittered in that beam the sound of the surf drummed in her ears a constant sound that reminded her she was alone would always be alone she flung up her hands called out in pain in fury the wind answered and spun those sparkling grains of sand faster faster power sliced through her a blade so cold it burned hot the storm she called roared and built until it blocked the light of that pure white moon why do you do this she turned in the torrent and looked at her lost sister golden hair shimmered blue eyes were dark with sorrow for justice she needed to believe that for you no the one who had been air didnt reach out but stood quiet hands folded at her waist for vengeance for hate we were never meant to use what we are for blood he spilled yours first and should my weakness my fears excuse yours weak magic dark boiled inside her i am stronger now than ever i was i have no fears you are alone the one you loved sacrificed and she could see like a dream within the dream the man who had held her heart she watched him watched again as he was struck down taken from her and their children by the bitter edge of her own actions the tears that swam into her eyes burned like acid he should have stayed away he loved you i am beyond love now air turned over her hands hands that gleamed as white as that blinding moonlight there is no life without love and no hope i broke the first link between us and lacked the courage to forge it back again now you break the second find your compassion make your amends the chain grows weak i would change nothing our sister will be put to the test urgently now air stepped closer without us she may fail then our circle is broken once and forever our childrens children will pay i have seen it you ask me to give up what i have tasted what i can now call with a thought she flung out a hand and the great sea rose to rage against the shimmering wall of sand a thousand voices screaming i will not before i am done with this every man every woman every child who cursed us who hunted us like vermin will writhe in agony then you damn us air said quietly and all who come after us look and see what may be the wall of sand dissolved the furious sea reared back froze for one throbbing moment the moon so white so pure split and dripped cold blood across the black sky lightning slashed and whipped stabbed down toward the earth to smoke and to burn flames erupted fed by the wild and greedy wind so that the dark was blinded with light the night became one long terrified scream as the island was swallowed by the sea however upsetting the dream ripley could convince herself it was a result of guilt and chocolate in the light of day she could shrug off the anxiety it had caused and expend her energy shoveling the latest snowfall by the time zack joined her shed finished the steps and half the walk ill do the rest go in and get some coffee some breakfast couldnt eat i gorged on brownies last night so i can use the exercise hey he caught her by the chin lifting her face for a long study you look tired didnt sleep very well whats gnawing at you nothing i ate too many sweets didnt sleep well and now im paying for it baby youre talking to somebody who knows you when youve got a problem you march through work physical and mental drudgery until you come out the other side spill it theres nothing to spill she shuffled her feet then finally just sighed her brother could simply stand and wait through an entire geological era for an answer okay im not ready to spill it im working it out all right if all this shovelings helping you with that ill just leave you to it he started back in she didnt just look tired he thought she looked unhappy at least he could take her mind off that he scooped up a handful of snow smoothed it into a ball what were big brothers for and let it fly it hit the back of her head with a solid whomp he wasnt leadoff pitcher for the islands softball team without reason ripley turned slowly studied his cheerful grin so want to play do you she grabbed up snow as she sidestepped the instant he bent down for ammo she fired straight between his eyes she played third and it was a brave or foolish runner who tried to steal home against her arm they pummeled each other winging snowballs across the halfshoveled walk slinging insults and taunts after them by the time nell came to the door the once pristine blanket over the lawn was bisected with messy paths dented with furrows where bodies had temporarily fallen lucy with high delighted barks shot through the door like a bullet and dived into the action amused nell hugged her arms against the chill and stepped out on the porch you children better come in and get cleaned up she called out or youll be late for school it was instinct more than plan that had brother and sister doing instant and identical pivots the two snowballs hit nell dead center the resulting squeal had ripley laughing so hard she had to drop to her knees where lucy leaped on her oops zack swallowed the grin as he caught the dangerous glint in his wifes eyes sorry honey it was you know a reflex ill show you a reflex its comforting to know the entire island police force will shoot the unarmed she sniffed shot her chin into the air i want that walk cleared off and you can clean off my car while youre at it if you can spare a moment from your hilarity she sailed back inside slammed the door ouch ripley said then dissolved into laughter again looks like you may be bunking on the sofa tonight hotshot she doesnt hold a grudge but he winced hunched his shoulders ill go take care of her car got you whipped doesnt she he merely burned her with a look ill kill you later still chuckling ripley hauled herself to her feet as her brother and lucy plowed through the snow toward the back of the house nothing she thought like a good snow fight to put everything back on an even keel as soon as she finished the walk she would go inside and make nice to nell still shed counted on nells having a little more sense of humor what was a little snow between friends brushing herself off ripley picked up the shovel then heard the pained howl the wild barks gripping the shovel like a bat she raced around the side of the house as she cleared the corner she was greeted by a face full of snow the shocked gasp caused her to swallow some of it choke as she spit it out rubbed it off her face she saw her brother covered to his shoulders with snow and nell standing with a smug smile and two empty buckets she banged them together smartly to shake out any remaining snow that she said with a nod was reflex boy ripley tried to dig under her collar where snow was dribbling cold and wet shes good she was able to maintain the good even mood through most of the day she mightve stayed there if dennis ripley hadnt come shuffling into the station house its my favorite delinquent as he rarely failed to entertain her ripley propped her feet on the desk and prepared to enjoy the show whats up with you im supposed to apologize for causing trouble and to thank you for taking me back to school and blah blah gosh den ripley dabbed at an imaginary tear im touched the corner of his mouth turned up mom said i had to i got two days iss im grounded for three weeks and i have to write essays on responsibility and honesty essays thats the worst huh yeah he plopped down in the chair across from her sighed weightily i guess it was pretty stupid guess it was no point in hooking school in the winter he added no comment how about the history test i passed no kidding you are a jackass den well it wasnt as hard as i thought it was going to be and mom didnt wear me out like i figured she would dad either i just got the lecture oh ripley obliged him with a shudder and made him grin not the lecture i can use most of it in the essays i guess i learned my lesson though do tell well besides planning better so you dont freeze your ears off in the woods when you ditch school its less trouble to just do what youre supposed to mostly in the first place mostly she agreed and because she loved him she rose to make him a cup of instant hot chocolate and because you made me go in and say what i did right out i didnt have to sweat it out you know dad said how when you mess up you have to face up to it make it right then people respect you and even more you can you know respect yourself she felt a twinge in her gut as she dumped chocolate powder in a mug man she muttered everybody makes mistakes but cowards hide from them thats a good one doncha think aunt rip i can use that in the essay yeah she cursed under her breath thats a good one if a twelveyearold boy could face the music ripley told herself then a thirtyyearold woman had to be able to do the same maybe shed rather be grounded maybe shed rather write the dreaded essay than knock on macs door but there was no option not with guilt shame and the example of a twelveyearold crowding her she thought mac might just slam the door in her face and she couldnt find it in herself to blame him if he did of course if he did then she could just write a polite note of apology which was almost like an essay when you thought about it facetoface had to be the first move though so she stood in front of his cottage door as the light dimmed with dusk and prepared to eat crow he opened the door he was wearing his glasses and a sweatshirt that carried an emblem from whatsamatta u and a picture of bullwinkle under any other circumstances it would have been amusing deputy todd he said very coolly can i come in for a minute she swallowed the first stringy morsel of crow please he stepped back gestured she could see hed been working a couple of the monitors were booted up one of them had zigzagging lines that put her in mind of hospital equipment he had a fire going and she could smell stale coffee im interrupting she began thats all right let me take your coat no defensively she pulled it tighter this wont take long then ill get out of your hair i want to apologize for the other day i was wrong totally wrong and completely out of line theres no excuse for what i did what i said or how i behaved well that about covers it hed wanted to stay angry with her hed been very comfortable in that groove accepted she jammed her hands in her pockets she didnt like it when things were too easy i overreacted she said im not going to argue there id like to finish her voice frosted go right ahead i dont know why i overreacted but thats what i did even if you had been with mia in a in an intimate fashion it was none of my business im responsible for my own actions my own decisions and my own choices and thats the way i like it ripley he said gently now let me take your coat no im not staying i got myself worked up about it way more than it warranted considering that pisses me off and the fact is id talked myself into thinking that youd put the moves on me then put them on mia to try to soften both of us up so wed help you out with your work well he took his glasses off dangling them by the earpiece thats insulting i know it she said grimly and im sorry for it more im ashamed that i let myself use that to justify me using sex you know getting you worked up like i did as a punishment women who do that give sex a bad name so she blew out a breath tested herself no she didnt feel better damn it she felt mortified so thats all ill let you get back to what you were doing she turned to the door and he moved with her braced a hand on it digging beneath the surface which is something i like doing theres a small specific area of your overreaction that i find satisfying in a strictly shallow egotistical manner she didnt look at him refused to why bother when she could hear the smirk in his voice that just makes me feel more like an idiot im not opposed to that result he ran his hand down her long tail of hair im taking your coat he tugged it off her shoulders want a beer no it surprised her that what she wanted was a hug just a quick little cuddle and shed never been the cuddling type no im on call he touched her hair again a quick dance of his fingers down the soft stream of it want to kiss and make up i think well just take a break from the kissing part of the agenda she took the coat from him sidestepped and dumped it on the floor by the front door she nodded at his sweatshirt your alma mater hmm he glanced down focused yeah i did some postgrad work there you havent lived till youve seen spring in frostbite falls she smiled and felt better i cant peg you mac me either do you want he broke off as the phone rang then stood looking blankly around the room sounds like the telephone to me ripley said helpfully yeah which one bedroom he decided and loped away she reached down for her coat it would probably be best if she just eased out while he was busy then she heard him speaking what she thought was spanish what was it about foreign languages she wondered that stirred the juices she left her coat where it was and strolled casually toward the bedroom he was standing by the bed his glasses now hooked by the earpiece in the front pocket of his jeans the bed was made she appreciated that basic tidiness in a man books were stacked piled spread everywhere he paced as he spoke and she noticed he wasnt wearing shoes just thick socks one black one navy it was so cute he seemed to be talking very quickly whenever she heard a foreign language it seemed to be rapid just a flood of incomprehensible words in fascinating accents she cocked her head he seemed to be concentrating fiercely but not she thought on the spanish it came too fluently to be anything but second nature then he began searching the room patting his shirt with one hand right front pocket she said and caused him to turn and blink at her glasses uh no yes qué no no uno momento why dont i have a pen she walked over picked up one of the three that lay on his nightstand when he still looked frustrated she offered a pad to go with it thanks i dont know why they always como sí sí he sat on the side of the bed and began to scribble since shed already poked her nose in this far ripley didnt see any reason to stop now she angled her head to read his notes only to be confounded when they were again in shorthand probably in spanish too she decided and took the opportunity to study his bedroom there werent any clothes strewn around there wouldnt have been much room for them with the books the magazines the stacks of paper no personal photographs which she thought was too bad there was the usual pile of loose change on the dresser along with a saint christophers medal she remembered the grisgris in his glove compartment and wondered how many other bases hed covered there was a leatherman knife a set of small screwdrivers a few unidentifiable bits of plastic and metal that might have been some sort of fuse and some kind of glassy black rock she touched it and feeling a low vibrating hum decided not to touch it again when she turned back he was still sitting on the side of the bed hed hung up the phone and was staring into space with an expression both distracted and dreamy she cleared her throat to get his attention so you speak spanish mmm bad news huh no no interesting a colleague in costa rica thinks he may have a line on an ebe whats that oh ebe extraterrestrial biological entity a little green man sure mac set the note aside it goes with all the broomriding witches ive documented ha anyway its interesting well see how it goes if nothing else it got you in my bedroom youre not as fogbrained as you look only about half the time he patted the bed beside him thats a really thrilling offer but ill pass im going to head home why dont we grab some dinner he took off his glasses tossed them carelessly on the bed out well go out and get some dinner is it dinnertime it could be take your glasses off the bed youll forget and sit on them or something right he picked them up laid them on the nightstand how did you know i do that wild guess mind if i call home let my family know i wont be home for dinner go ahead when she stepped to the phone he took her hand turned her nudging her in until she stood between his legs id like to discuss that break from kissing you talked about and i think since youre the one who apologized you should be the one to kiss me im thinking about it she picked up the phone first kept her eyes on his as she called spoke briefly to zack then replaced the receiver okay heres the deal hands on the bed and you keep them there no touching no grabbing thats very strict but okay he placed his palms down on the edge of the bed it was time she decided to show him he wasnt the only one with moves she leaned over slowly letting her hands run through his hair before they rested on his shoulders her mouth paused an inch from his curved no hands she said again a brush of lips a slight scrape of teeth a hint of tongue she nibbled one corner of his mouth then the other let her breath come out on a long sigh she eased back a breath away held the moment suspended then her fingers dived into his hair fisted and she plunged instant heat enough to burn a man alive from the inside out his hands tightened like vises on the edge of the bed and his heart spiked straight into his throat it was like being devoured with merciless greed she took him over pumped into his system like a fastacting drug one that scraped nerve endings raw rather than numbing them he could feel too much and waited for his system to simply implode she nearly shoved him back nearly gave in to the need plunging inside her and pushed him back on the bed something happened to her every time she was with him that jangled her brain shocked her body squeezed her heart even now when shed demanded and taken control she was losing she felt him tremble and her own shiver of response it took every ounce of will for her to end the kiss to draw back he let out a ragged breath she could see the pulse beating in his throat like a jackhammer yet he hadnt touched her that kind of control was something to respect she thought to admire and to challenge she dabbed a fingertip at the corner of her mouth lets eat she said and strolled out of the room point for point she decided as she scooped up her coat they were dead even nine jonathan q harding knew how to get people to talk it was a matter first of all of knowing that under the veil of dignity and discretion or reluctance people wanted to talk the seamier or more bizarre the subject the more they wanted to gab about it it was a matter of persistence patience and occasionally palming over a folded twenty the story had its teeth in him every bit as much as he had his teeth in it he started back at the cliff on highway where a desperate woman had faked her own death it was a picturesque spot sea sky rock he imagined stark blackandwhite photographs the drama of them he was no longer thinking just a feature in a magazine harding had upped the bar to a big juicy bestselling book the seeds of that ambition had been planted during his first visit with remington it was odd he thought that it hadnt occurred to him before that he hadnt realized how well hungry he was for the fame for the fortune others had done it turned their expertise or their hobby into a book with a glossy cover and fast sales why couldnt he why was he wasting his time and his considerable skill on magazine bylines instead of him pursuing larry king for an interview this time around larry king would come to him a voice he hadnt known was inside him had awakened and it continually whispered cash in thats just what he intended to do gathering tidbits of information morsels of speculation and hard bites of fact from police records he began to follow helen remingtons now nell channing todds trail he had an interesting conversation with a man who claimed to have sold her the secondhand bike shed used as her initial transportation and after various questions asked at the bus station in carmel confirmed the bikes description helen remington had started her long journey pedaling a blue sixspeed he imagined her riding up and down the hills shed been wearing a wig some reports said red some brown he was going with the brunette she wouldnt have wanted to be flashy he spent more than two weeks tracking backtracking rapping into the wall of false leads until he hit his first jackpot in dallas where nell channing had rented a cheap motel room with kitchenette and taken a job as a shortorder cook in a greasy spoon her name was lidamae it said so on the name plate pinned to the candypink bodice of her uniform shed been waiting tables for thirty years and figured shed poured enough cups of coffee to fill the whole of the damn gulf of mexico shed been married twice and had kicked both sons of bitches out on their lazy asses she had a cat named snowball a tenthgrade education and a texas twang so sharp you couldve cut diamonds with it she didnt mind getting off her dogs for a few minutes to talk to a reporter and didnt scruple to refuse the offer of a twenty for her time and trouble lidamae tucked the bill just where youd suppose she would into the generous cup of her bra the sheer perfection of her the overbleached hair teased into an enormous cascade the blowzy body the staggering blue of the eyeshadow that covered her lids almost to her eyebrows had harding wondering who might play her in the film based on his book i told tidas tidas he runs the kitchen back there i told tidas there was something odd about that girl something spooky what do you mean by spooky a look in the eye a rabbit look scared of her own shadow always watching the door too course i knew right off she was on the run with a satisfied nod lidamae took a pack of camels out of her apron pocket women we sense these things about our own kind my second husband tried to kick me around a time or two she dragged in smoke like breath hah it was his ass got kicked a man raises his hand to me hed better have a good health policy cause hes gonna spend some quality time in a medicaltype facility did you ever ask her about it wouldnt say boo to a goose that one lidamae snorted sending a dragonstream of smoke out of her nostrils kept to herself did her work you cant say different and never was anything but polite a lady i said to tidas that nells a lady got quality written all over her thin as a rail her hair all whacked off any which way and dyed mongrel brown didnt matter quality shows she took another drag then wagged the cigarette i wasnt the least bit surprised when i saw the news report recognized her right off too even though she was all polished up and blond in the picture they showed i said to suzanne suzanne and me were working the lunch shift i said suzanne look at that on the tv set that one there over the counter she added for hardings benefit i said thats little nell who worked here a few weeks last year coulda knocked suzanne over with a feather but me i wasnt surprised how long did she work here right about three weeks then one day she just doesnt show for her shift didnt see hide nor hair of her again till that news report on the tv tidas was pissed let me tell you that girl could cook did anyone ever come looking for her pay more attention to her than seemed natural nope hardly ever poked her head out of the kitchen anyway do you think tidas would let me see her employment records lidamae took a last drag on her cigarette studying harding through the curtain of blue smoke dont hurt to ask does it it cost him another twenty to look at the paperwork but it gave him the exact date of nells departure armed with that and a reasonable assessment of her finances harding scouted out the bus station he tracked her to el paso nearly lost her but then dug up the man whod sold her a car he followed her trail by day read over and over every news article interview statement and commentary that had been written since remingtons arrest shed worked in diners hotel restaurants coffee shops rarely staying in one spot longer than three weeks during the first six months of flight there seemed little rhyme and no reason to her route and that harding thought had been the point she would head south then east then overlap her own tracks and drive north again even so shed always eventually headed east again though he didnt put much credence in lidamaes opinion of her own insight he did find a thread of consistency throughout his interviews with employers and coworkers nell channing was a lady how much more she was hed have to judge for himself he couldnt wait to meet her facetoface but before he did he wanted more he wanted evan remingtons story unaware that her life was currently under a microscope nell took advantage of her day off and a break in the weather the february thaw offered a teasing hint of spring with warmth that required no more than a light jacket she took lucy for a walk on the beach and toyed with the idea of going into the village to buy something foolish and unnecessary the fact that she could toy with the idea was one of her daily miracles for now she was content with the beach the sea and the big black dog while lucy entertained herself chasing gulls nell sat on the sand and watched the waves lucky for you im in a good mood or id have to write you up for having that dog off the leash nell glanced over as ripley dropped down beside her youd have to write yourself up too i didnt see a leash when the two of you went for a run this morning i used the invisible leash this morning ripley wrapped her arms around her updrawn knees god what a day i could take a few hundred of these i know i couldnt stay in the house my todo list is as long as your arm but i ran away itll keep its going to when nell continued to stare at her ripley tipped down her sunglasses peered over them what nothing you look pleased with yourself nell decided i havent seen much of you in the past couple weeks but whenever i have youve looked quite smug is that so well lifes good uhhuh youve been spending some time with macallister booke ripley trailed her fingers through the sand drawing little curlicues is that your polite way of asking if were doing it no nell waited a beat exhaled well are you no not yet content ripley leaned back braced her elbows in the sand im enjoying this presex interlude more than i figured i would mostly ive always figured if youre going to dance just get up and dance but romance is a dance of its own ripleys look was sharp and quick i didnt say we were having a romance like hearts and flowers and cow eyes hes an interesting guy to hang out with thats all when hes not caught up in spook patrol hes been all over the place i mean to places i didnt even know were places hed known the capital of liechtenstein she remembered imagine that did you know he graduated from college when he was sixteen she continued is that brainy or what even with all that he gets into regular stuff like movies and baseball i mean hes not snooty about what is it popular culture no intellectual snobbery nell commented enjoying herself yeah thats it hes into rocky and bullwinkle and he listens to regular music its like hes got this enormous brain capacity so it can hold on all the eequalsmcsquared junk but it still has room for the barenaked ladies plus hes totally buff and hes got excellent form in the water but sometimes he just trips over his own feet its kind of cute nell opened her mouth to comment again but ripley was already plowing on sure hes a complete geek but its sort of handy he fixed my headset when i was going to pitch it and the other day she frowned when she caught nells wide grin what now youre smitten oh please what kind of a word is that she snorted crossed her legs at the ankles smitten jesus its the perfect word from where im sitting and i think its wonderful dont get on that romance boat of yours and sail nell were just hanging out then well have sex and hang out well keep it friendly as long as he doesnt shove the witch angle down my throat then hell go back to new york and write his book or paper or whatever were not stuck on each other whatever you say but in all the months ive been on the sisters i havent seen you spend this much time with anyone else or look as happy doing it so i like him better than most ripley sat up again shrugged and im more attracted to him than most smitten nell said under her breath shut up bring him to dinner huh bring him home to dinner tonight why because im making zacks favorite and therell be plenty were having yankee pot roast ripleys mouth began to water im sure mac would appreciate sitting down to a homecooked meal instead of eating takeout or eating in a restaurant or heating up one of my deliveries nell stood up brushed sand off her pants sure he likes to eat nell youre not going to try any matchmaking deal are you her blue eyes widened with innocence of course not tell him sixthirty and let me know if thats not convenient she clapped her hands called for lucy then started for home she had a great deal to do in a short amount of time im not doing a spell mia angled her head smiled sweetly as nell scowled at the potato she was peeling then why did you ask me to come by and discuss your plans for tonights dinner because i admire your taste try again because you know ripley better than i do keep going oh all right grimacing in disgust nell snatched up another potato its not a spell that would be wrong wouldnt it she added with a quick sidelong glance yes that would be wrong you have neither partys permission added to that interfering with anyones personal life crosses a line i know it nells shoulders slumped just for a minute even when you have their best interest at heart she let the statement hang as a question though she knew the answer she looks so happy youve seen it for yourself you should have heard her she was absolutely bubbling about him deputy dawg bubbling mia chuckled id have paid to see that one she was and it was adorable all i wanted was to give her a little nudge not with a spell she added quickly before mia could speak a nice friendly family dinner and if i added a little of this a bit of that just something to encourage clear vision something that would lower the boundaries just a tiny inch or two and if theyre seeing what they need to see feeling what they need to feel at this moment can you be sure your nudge wont be in the wrong direction youre so frustrating when youre practical worse when youre right its hard not using whats available to help powers a tricky business if it wasnt it wouldnt mean anything youre in love yourself mia said still riding on that lovely rush of it all and youre seeing everyone coupled and cozy and content not all of us are meant for what you have with zack if you could have heard the way she babbled about him before she caught herself shaking her head nell scrubbed her peeled vegetables shes halfway in love with him and doesnt even know it mia indulged herself in one moment of pleasure and envy at the thought of her childhood friend taking the fall and if she did know it if you helped her see what may be happening inside her she might scramble back from that edge before she falls it would be just like her youre right again i hate that tell me what you think of him youve talked to him more than i have i think hes a very clever man very astute and very focused hes not pushing ripley with his research because he knows shell balk so he circles around that mia wandered to the cookie jar dipped in chocolate chunk im doomed thats calculation automatically nell moved to the stove to brew tea to go with mias cookie if hes using her wait mia held up a finger swallowed of course hes using her that isnt always wrong she refuses to let him be direct in this area so hes indirect why should he ignore what she is because she does nell to spend time with her to play on her feelings thats wrong i didnt say that and i dont think he is hes too well mannered and i think besides being smart hes also a very good man nell sighed yes so do i i imagine hes quite attracted to her despite the fact that shes abrasive annoying and hardheaded nell nodded that makes sense you care about her a great deal despite those facts i once did mia said flatly your kettles boiling she matters to you you matter to each other no matter what happened between you nell turned to deal with the tea and missed mias soulful expression shell have to deal with me again and i with her until she accepts who she is what she is and what shes meant to do shell never be open to what you have you had fear so does she so do we all whats your fear as soon as she asked nell turned back im sorry but i look at you and see only confidence such incredible assurance i fear feeling my heart break a second time because im not sure i could survive it id rather live alone than risk the pain the statement the quiet truth in it made nells own heart ache you loved him that much yes it hurt mia thought just to say it as much as it ever did i had no barriers where he was concerned so you see it could be dangerous to nudge at ripleys macallister booke is part of her destiny you know that yes looking isnt interfering theyre connected to each other but what they do about it the choices made are for them alone there was no arguing with mias logic but there was no reason not to choose pink candles for the table she neither charmed nor inscribed them the color being that used for love spells could be purely coincidental she already had rosemary potted on the windowsill for cooking of course and also to absorb negative energy it was true that that particular herb was used in love charms but that was neither here nor there nor was the rose quartz tumbled in a bowl nor the amethyst crystals that stimulated intuition it wasnt as if shed made a charm bag shed used zack and ripleys grandmothers china the silver candlesticks shed unearthed weeks before and polished to a gleam an antique lace tablecloth that had been a wedding present and a centerpiece of lily of the valley that shed forced to keep the winter gloom away the wineglasses had been another wedding gift and their garnet stems went well she thought with the pale pink candles and the rosebuds on the china she was so intent on judging the results that she jumped when zack came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist pretty fancy he rubbed his lips over her hair the table hasnt looked like that in come to think of it ive never seen it look like that i want it to be perfect i dont see how it could look better or smell better i nearly fell to my knees in reverence when i passed through the kitchen how come rips not helping you out its her date isnt it i chased her out half an hour ago she was in my way and so she turned kissed him briefly are you i figured you needed somebody to sample some of those little canapé things youve got in the kitchen no too late he grinned at her theyre great zack damn it i had them arranged i scooted everything in he told her as he followed her back into the kitchen no gaps keep your fingers out of the food or i wont make beef stew and dumplings with the leftovers nell honey thats downright mean no sulking now let me look at you she stepped back skimmed her gaze over him my arent you handsome sheriff todd he hooked a finger in the belt of her slacks come over here and say that she obliged was just lifting her mouth to his when she heard the knock on the front door thats him she broke free dragged off her apron hey come back here ripley can get the door no she cant she needs to make an entrance oh just she waved a hand at him as she hurried out go put on some music or something mac brought wine and flowers and earned nells approval three times that nell counted he touched ripleys hand as they enjoyed appetizers in the living room it was comfortable as shed wanted casual as shed planned and watching the two of them together she felt a nice warm glow by the time they settled down in the dining room nell was already patting herself on the back of all the places youve been she asked mac which is your favorite wherever i am is always my favorite three sisters is like this perfect little slice of the world and the natives are friendly enough zack added they are mac sent ripley a grin as he ate his roast mostly we discourage munching on missionaries and explorers these days ripley stabbed a potato mostly lucky for me ive had some interesting interviews lulu the maceys you talked to lulu ripley interrupted mmm she was top of my list shes lived here a long time but she wasnt born here and theres her close association with mia its intriguing to me the easy almost casual way lulu accepts the metaphysical she accepts mias gifts the way another might accept a childs hair color it would be different for you he said to nell coming into your talents as an adult i suppose she didnt mind talking about it in fact nell thought she might enjoy discussing the entire matter on an intellectual scientific plane but she recognized the warning signals in ripleys stiff shoulders more beef she asked brightly thanks its great zack i wonder if i could schedule some time with you get your perspective as someone whos lived here all his life and who married a woman of considerable talents sure my times fairly flexible he wasnt oblivious to his sisters reaction but he considered it her problem youre going to find that most of us dont think about the history of the island on a daily basis we save that for the tourists most of us just live here thats one of my points you live with it go about your business create and maintain normal lives we are normal ripley said softly exactly mac lifted his wine studied her coolly power doesnt alter doesnt have to alter elemental human needs home family love financial security the close familial relationship between lulu and mia for example isnt based on what mia is but on who she is he looked at zack i dont imagine you married nell because shes a witch or despite it but because shes nell true then there was her pot roast which cant be discounted strong emotion feeds power ive been pretty emotional about nells cooking since my first bowl of soup zack chuckled as he topped off everyones wine good thing i saw her first timing is key if lulu hadnt landed here when she landed here she might not have had the major role in mias upbringing and as i understand it nell if you hadnt walked into the bookstore at the exact moment that mias former café chef was quitting you might not have made that connection or not that precise connection that connection led to one with zack and to ripley and in a winding indirect way to me i dont have anything to do with it ripleys voice remained soft but the barbs were poking through your choice mac said easily choice is another key in any case since youre reluctant to show me around the island when im working i wanted to ask you about a place on the south point great old house lots of gingerbread wide covered porch theres not much else around it its just up from a cove that has a shale beach theres a terrific little cave the logan place she said shortly the family that owns the hotel it looked empty they dont live here anymore they rent it out now and then during the season why do you care first because its a beautiful spot and an appealing old house next because i got particularly strong readings in that area he watched ripleys gaze flick to her brothers face hold a moment i havent heard much about the logans they show up in my research of course but no one has much to say about them in the village how long since any of the family lived in the house more than ten years zack answered when ripley remained silent mr logan or one of his representatives comes back now and then to look things over but they stay at the hotel shame to let a beautiful house like that sit empty is it haunted zacks lips twitched at the muttered rumble his sister made not that i know of too bad and he meant it how about the cave i got the strongest readings there the caves a cave ripley shot there was a little twist in her heart and it annoyed her we used it as boys zack began to play pirate and hunt for treasure teenagers have been known to treat it as a kind of lovers lane he stopped abruptly as it struck home sam logan and mia theyd been teenagers once and the cave would surely have been theirs one look at his sisters face told him shed known and was trying to protect a childhood friends privacy wouldnt surprise me if your equipments picking up on all those hormones zack said cheerfully whats for dessert honey at sea nell rose ill get it ripley mind giving me a hand no fine sure annoyed ripley pushed away from the table and stalked into the kitchen what is it nell demanded what dont you want to say about the logan place its just an old house ripley i cant help if im in the dark with her hands in her pockets ripley paced the kitchen sam and mia they were a major item i know that much he left and hasnt been back it still hurts her yeah well she ought to get the hell over it with a sigh ripley bent down to stroke diego the cat they were lovers mia and i we were still we were friends we knew everything about each other the first time she was with sam the first time they were together was in the cave it was one of their meeting places i see its still a raw spot with her and she doesnt need some jerk asking questions and taking energy readings ripley dont you think if mac knew hed be less likely to rub against that sore spot i dont know what to think about him disgusted ripley straightened one minute hes a nice guy and the next hes trying to wheedle data out of you over your own pot roast hes got no business coming here as a guest and pressuring you and zack i didnt feel pressured nell took a boston cream pie out of the refrigerator im sorry it upsets you ripley but ive already decided to talk to mac im interested in his work and im interested in contributing to it you want to be one of his lab rats i dont feel that way im not ashamed of what i am and im not afraid of what ive been given not anymore you think im afraid ripleys temper flared thats bullshit as big a pile of bullshit as this idiotic project of his i dont want anything to do with it ive got to get out of here she turned on her heel and shoved out the back door she couldnt think but she knew she needed to walk off the anger before she said or did anything regrettable nells business was nells business she tried to tell herself as she jogged down the beach steps in the pearl glow of moonlight and if nell wanted to make an exhibition of herself expose herself to gossip to ridicule to god knew what she was entitled to do so in a pigs eye ripley called out kicking at sand as she hit the beach what nell said or did had a direct link to her there was no avoiding it not only because they were related by marriage but because they were connected and that son of a bitch macallister booke knew it he was using her to get to nell using nell to get to her shed been stupid to let her guard down these past few weeks stupid and there was little she hated more than realizing shed been a fool at the barking behind her she turned just as the big black shape leaped out of the dark lucys exuberance knocked ripley on her butt damn it lucy are you hurt are you okay mac rushed up behind the dog started to lift ripley to her feet get off me youre freezing what the hells wrong with you running out without a coat here even as she slapped at his hands he bundled her into the jacket nell had given him fine youve done your good deed now beat it your brother and nell are probably used to your spontaneous displays of rudeness he heard the scolding tone of his own voice but the closed and stubborn look on her face told him that she deserved it however id like an explanation rude she used both hands to shove him back two full steps youve got the nerve to call me rude after that interrogation at dinner i recall a conversation at dinner not an interrogation just hold on he grabbed her arms as lucy wanting to play wiggled between them you dont want to talk to me about my work and i havent pressed you that doesnt mean im not going to talk to anybody else you hook nell and you know its going to involve me you talked to lulu and you damn well asked her questions about me ripley patience he warned himself she wasnt just angry she was scared i never said i wouldnt ask questions im just not asking you if you want control of what involves you then talk to me otherwise i have to use what i get secondhand all of this was just to corner me he was a patient man by nature but that patience had its limits you know better just as you know saying that is an insult to both of us so just can it just i have feelings for you it makes it complicated but im dealing with it and that aside ripley youre not the center of this youre only part of it ill work around you or with you its your choice i wont be used neither will i as a target for your emotional storms he was right bullseye right and she wavered i wont be ogled like a sideshow ripley his voice gentled youre not a freak youre a miracle i dont want to be either cant you understand that yeah i can i know exactly what its like to be looked at as one or the other or both at the same time what can i tell you all you can be is who and what you are temper was gone she couldnt even find the pieces of it hed talked her down not because he wanted something but because he got it at the core he got it maybe i didnt think youd understand youd know maybe i should have i guess being the big brain is a kind of magic and its not always comfortable how do you do it she demanded how do you stay so goddamn balanced im not cut it out lucy still gripping ripleys arms he shifted as the dog barked and vibrated between them then he saw what had caught lucys attention she stood on the beach as she had before and she watched them her face was pale in the moonlight her hair dark as the wind teased it her eyes seemed to glow against the night deeply green deeply sad the surf foamed up spilled over her feet and ankles but she made no sign of feeling the cold or wet she simply stood watched and wept you see her mac whispered ive seen her all my life tired now ripley stepped away from him because it would be too easy frighteningly easy to step toward him ill let you know what i decide when i decide it and i want to apologize for being rude and swiping at you for mucking things up but right now i need to be by myself ill walk you back no thanks but no come on lucy mac stayed where he was between two women both of them pulled at him ten nell found it strange to knock on the door of a house where shed once lived part of her still thought of the yellow cottage as hers she had lived much longer in the white palace in california and had never considered it hers unless it was to think of it as her prison one shed risked her own life to escape but the little cottage by the wood had been hers for only a few months and had given her some of the happiest moments of her life her first home the place where she had begun to feel safe and strong the place where she and zack had fallen in love even the terror shed known there the spilled blood couldnt spoil the sense of belonging that the little yellow cottage with its dollhouse rooms gave her still she knocked and waited politely on the front stoop until mac opened the door he looked distracted he was unshaven his hair sticking up in wild spikes sorry did i wake you what no up for hours um he dragged a hand through his hair tousling it further what was she doing there did they have an appointment jeez what time was it sorry my minds come on in the peek past him showed her the room jammed with equipment lights were glowing and something was beeping steadily you must be working i wont disturb you i just wanted to bring you some of last nights dessert you missed it dessert oh right thanks come in actually im on my way to work so ill just since she was now talking to his retreating back nell shrugged and stepped inside closed the door behind her why dont i just put this in the kitchen for you uhhuh look at this wait wait he held up one hand making notes with the other as he studied a printout that put nell in mind of a seismograph after a moment he looked over at her again and beamed you just sparkle dont you excuse me the readings changed the minute you came into the house really fascinated she stepped a little closer and realized that no matter how close she got she would never understand a thing about it its different with ripley mac went on her readings are all over the chart and you never know but you youre a dependable soul her lips pursed the beginnings of a pout that makes me sound boring on the contrary he took the plate from her lifting the protective wrap to break off a piece of the pie scattering crumbs youre a comfort id say youre a woman whos found her place and is happy there im sorry i messed up dinner last night you didnt if youre going to eat that now let me get you a fork when she walked back to the kitchen he followed her watched her go to the right drawer take out a fork does it sorry does it bother me to be in here she finished for him and handed him the fork no this house is clean i cleansed it myself i needed to do it myself a strong comfort sheriff todds a very lucky man yes he is sit down mac ive got ten minutes do you want coffee with that well he glanced down at the pie he couldnt quite remember if hed eaten any breakfast besides the pie was here sure you said it was different with ripley nell said as she measured out coffee what was already in the pot looked nearly as hideous as it smelled and she poured it straight down the drain youre right i dont know all the reasons why but she doesnt talk about it and if i did i wouldnt talk about it its for her but shes my sister so im going to ask you straight out is your interest in her only to do with your work no he shifted a bit seeking comfort he was a man more used to asking the questions than answering them in fact it would probably be easier for me and certainly easier for her if she wasnt involved in the work but she is was she all right when she got home last night she wasnt angry anymore unsettled but not angry im going to confess and get this out of the way i set things up last night you mean the pink candles the rose quartz sprigs of rosemary and so on relaxed again mac shoveled another bite of pie into his mouth i noticed so much for subtlety irked nell got down a mug i didnt do a spell appreciate it he said with his mouth full i also appreciate knowing you thought about doing one im flattered youd consider me someone youd like to see with ripley are you making fun of me not exactly i upset her last night and im sorry for that but its something were both going to have to come to terms with she is what she is i do what i do angling her head nell studied him she wouldnt be attracted to you not for long anyway if you were a pushover good to know will you talk to me on the record yes just like that no qualifications she set his coffee on the table i wont tell you anything i dont want you to know im still learning mac i may learn as much from you as you do from me but now i have to get to work one question does the power make you happy yes happy and centered and strong but i could be all those things without it her dimples winked now ask me if i could be this happy without zack i dont have to after shed left mac sat thinking about her for a while about how she seemed to fit so comfortably into the rhythm of the island the rhythm of her power it couldnt have been easy for her yet he thought she made it seem like the most natural thing in the world to have started a new life out of the horrors of another what had happened to her hadnt scarred her shed been able to trust again to love again to become that he decided made her the most admirable woman of his acquaintance he could also see why ripley was so determined to protect her somehow he would have to make the hardheaded deputy see that nell was in no danger from his direction he packed up the equipment he wanted to take with him on his planned field trip and spent ten frustrating minutes searching for his glasses before realizing that hed hooked them onto his shirt pocket he found his keys in the bathroom medicine cabinet scooped up a few extra pencils and was on his way to the south point of the island the logan house pulled at him he could think of no other way to describe the almost physical tug he experienced when he stood on the edge of the narrow shale road and studied it it was big and rambling he wouldnt have said it was particularly grand particularly charming compelling he decided as he dragged out his recorder to log his thoughts the logan house sits on the south point of the island and is accessible by a narrow crushedshale road there are other houses nearby but this one sits on the highest rise and is closest to the sea he paused a minute let himself feel the wind taste the salt in it the water was a hard blue today a hue that made him wonder why the sea didnt slice itself open with its own waves when he turned a circle he studied the other houses more rentals he deduced there was no sound no movement except the sea and the air and the gulls that swooped over this quiet stretch to cry mias cliffs and wasnt it odd that they were at nearly the precise opposite end of the island were more picturesque he thought more dramatic more everything yet this spot seemed right somehow right for him its three stories he continued with recording his observations it looks as though several additions have been made to the original structure its wood cedar at a guess faded to silver someone must maintain it as the paint a grayish blue is fresh on the shutters and trim the porches front and back are deep and wide with a section of the back area screened off it has narrower balconies off many of the second and thirdstory windows with curling maybe theyre called valances ill look it up along the overhangs its a lonely spot but it doesnt feel lonely more like its waiting its odd that it feels as if its waiting for me he walked across the sandy patch of lawn around the side of the house to the back where he could stand just above the beach and study the quiet cove there was a dock again well maintained but no boat tied to it he would want a sailboat he decided maybe a motor launch as well and the masculinity of the house needed to be softened a bit with some flora he would have to research what grew best in this type of soil he wondered if both the chimneys were in working order and what it would be like to sit in the winter with a fire roaring while he watched the sea shaking off the daydreams he went back to his land rover and unloaded his equipment it was only a short hike to the cave he noted that the shadowed mouth of it was hidden from the house by the slight curve of the land making it more private more mysterious a perfect spot for kids adventures and young lovers he decided but if it was still used for such purposes there was no sign he could see no litter no footprints no markings as he walked across the shale he had to make two trips and though the air in the cave was cool and slightly damp he shed his jacket he set up his equipment to the pretty music of lapping water and the echoes of the underground chamber the cave wasnt large he measured it at just over eleven feet long and just under eight wide he was grateful that the heart of it was more than seven feet high hed spent time in others that had forced him to squat or hunch or even explore on his belly armed with a halogen flashlight something he hadnt had along with him on his first trip he studied every inch of the cave while his equipment ran something here he mumbled i dont need the machines to tell me theres something here like layers of energy new over old nothing scientific about that but there you go its a strong sense gut sense if this is the cave mentioned in my research it means whats this he paused shining his light on the wall of the cave he had to squat after all to see it clearly looks like gaelic he said reading the words carved into the stone ill have to translate it when i get back for now he copied down the words in his notebook and the symbol beneath them celtic knot trinity pattern this carving isnt that old ten years twenty maximum another guess ill test and verify then he ran his fingers along the carvings the indentations filled with lights that lanced out in narrow beams his fingertips warmed with the heat of them holy shit is that cool or what he sprang up to get his gauge and his video camera forgetting the curve of the cave ceiling and he rapped his head hard enough to see stars idiot son of a bitch damn it god with one hand clamped on his head he paced and cursed until the sharpest edge of the pain dulled to a vicious throb pain was replaced by disgust when he noted the wet smear of blood on his palm resigned he dug out a handkerchief dabbed gingerly at the knot that was forming he held the cloth in place while he gathered his camera and gauge this time he sat on the ground he took measurements logged them then prepared to document the changes ran his fingers over the carving again and nothing happened come on now i saw what i saw and i have the minor concussion to prove it he tried again but the carving stayed dark and the stone cool and damp undeterred he stayed where he was cleared his mind he ignored the nasty headache already full blown as he lifted his hand again his monitors began to beep what the hell are you doing holding a séance ripley stood at the mouth of the cave the sun throwing a nimbus around her body too many thoughts jumbled in his mind and all of them involved her he gave up for now on the carving and just looked at her are you on cave patrol today i saw your car she scanned his equipment as she stepped into the cave it was still madly beeping what are you doing sitting on the ground back there working he scooted around to face her then sat back on his heels got any aspirin on you no she played her flashlight over him then rushed forward youre bleeding for gods sake mac just a little i hit my head shut up let me see she yanked his head forward ignoring his yelp of protest pawed through his hair to get to the scrape jeez nurse ratched have a heart its not too bad you wont need stitches if you didnt have all this hair to cushion your lame brain itd be a different story are we on speaking terms again she sighed a little then lowered herself to the cave floor sitting as he was back on her heels i did some thinking i dont have any right to interfere with your work i dont have any business resenting it either you were up front about it right from the start and what you said last night was true you havent pushed me she was wearing earrings she didnt always these were tiny dangles of silver and gold he wanted to play with them and the pretty curve of her ear that sounds like a lot of thinking i guess it was maybe ive got to do some more but for right now id like to put things back the way they were id like that but i need you to know im going to talk to nell on the record ripley pressed her lips together thats up to nell its just that shes ill be careful with her ripley looked in his eyes yeah she said after a moment you will and with you i dont need you to be careful with me maybe id enjoy it he slid his arms around her waist rising to his knees drawing her up to hers in the back of his mind he could hear the monitors pick up again he could have cared less he wanted one thing at that moment and only one thing his mouth on hers as their lips met her arms wound around him her body fit to his like the last piece of a complex and fascinating puzzle for a moment it was soft and it was warm and it was everything shaken she drew back something inside her was trembling mac lets not talk about it his mouth brushed her cheeks her temples skimmed down to graze her neck after a while talk just intellectualizes everything i ought to know good point it has to be soon his lips crushed down on hers soon or im going to lose my mind i need to think about it a little more he let out one ragged breath before he gentled his grip think fast okay she laid her palm on his cheek im pretty sure im about done with that section of our program how odd mia said as she strode into the cave and how awkward as she watched ripley and mac draw apart she tossed her hair back i dont mean to interrupt even as she spoke macs equipment began to shrill needles slashed like whips as one of his sensors began to smoke he scrambled up saying nothing she spun around and walked back into the sunlight jesus it fried it it fucking fried it since he sounded more excited than distressed ripley left mac to his equipment and followed mia outside hold up as if she hadnt heard mia continued over the shale to where the water of the cove lapped and retreated where small tidal pools teemed with life mia wait a minute i didnt think you walked over this way anymore i walk wherever i please but not here she thought staring blindly across the water never here until today did you bring him here she spun around hair flying eyes brimming with a terrible grief did you tell him what this place is to me the years fell away between them for that moment oh mia how could you think that im sorry one tear escaped shed sworn never to shed another over him but one escaped i shouldnt have i know you wouldnt she dashed the tear away turned to face the water again it was just seeing you in there together holding each other and in that particular spot what oh god mia ripley pressed her fingers to her forehead as she remembered the carving i didnt realize i swear i wasnt thinking why should you it shouldnt matter anyway she crossed her arms over her breasts hugged the elbows tight because it did matter and it always would it was long ago when he wrote that long ago when i was foolish enough to believe he meant it to need him to hes not worth it no mans worth it youre right of course but i believe unfortunately that theres one person for each of us whos worth everything rather than speak ripley laid a hand on mias shoulder left it there when mia reached back held it i miss you ripley the grief of it trembled in her voice like tears the two of you left holes in me and neither of us will be pleased tomorrow that i said that today so briskly she released ripleys hand stepped away poor mac i should go make amends you smoked one of his toys i think but he seemed more jazzed by it than upset still one should have more control she replied as you well know bite me ah were back well then ill go see what i can do to patch things up she started back toward the cave glanced over her shoulder coming no you go ahead ripley waited until mia disappeared into the shadow of the cave before she let out a long breath i miss you too she stayed there crouching at a tidal pool until she pulled herself together mia had always been better she thought at smoothing her ruffles and ripley had always envied her that degree of selfcontrol she watched the little world in the water a kind of island she supposed where each depended on the others for survival mia was depending on her she didnt want to think about it didnt want to accept her connection or the responsibility it put on her shoulders refusing to believe it had given her a decade of normality and cost her a cherished friend then nell had come and the circle had formed again the power of that had been so brilliant so strong as if it had never been locked away it had been hard very hard to turn the key again now there was mac she had to decide if he was the next link in a chain that would drag her down or the key to another lock she wished with all her heart he could be just a man mias laughter drifted out of the cave and ripley straightened how did she do that ripley wondered how did she turn herself around in such a short span of time she started toward the cave just as mia and mac stepped out for an instant she saw another woman hair bright as flame sweep out of that dark mouth bundled in her arms was a sleek black pelt the vision wavered blurred then slid away like a painting left out in the rain it left behind the vague headache that those images always brought with them ten years she thought again for ten years shed blocked it all now it was seeping back liquid through cracks in a glass if she didnt shore up those cracks it would all break free and never be contained again though her knees had jellied she strode forward so whats the joke just enjoying each others company mia wrapped her arm around macs sent him a slow warm look from under her lashes ripley just shook her head get the goofy grin off your face booke she does it on purpose what is it about you and men mia you get within two feet of one and his iq drops below his belt just one of my many talents dont look so flustered handsome she rose to her toes to kiss macs cheek she knows i never poach then stop teasing him hes starting to sweat i like him deliberately mia cuddled against macs side hes so cute is there any way i can enter this conversation mac wondered without sounding like a moron no but i think were done now ripley hooked her thumbs in her jacket pockets hows your head nothing a bottle of aspirin wont cure when he reached up to probe gingerly at the knot mia asked did you hurt yourself let me see she was a great deal more gentle than ripley had been but just as firm after she took a look she hissed out a breath you might have had some compassion mia snapped at ripley its just a scratch its seeping blood swollen and painful none of which is necessary sit she ordered mac and gestured at a tumble of rocks really its nothing dont worry about it im always banging into something sit mia all but shoved him down then drew a small bag out of her pocket i have a connection to the cave she said as she took some cayenne out of her bag and so a connection to this be still she stroked her fingers over the cut he felt a gathering of heat a focus of the pain before he could speak she was chanting quietly with herb and touch and thought to heal this wound under my care to seal from illness and pain let him now be free as i will so mote it be there now she bent over touched her lips to the unmarked top of his head better yes he blew out a long breath the ache the throbbing had vanished before shed finished her chant ive seen cayenne work on minor cuts but not like that not instantly the herbs a kind of backup now be more careful with that handsome head of yours friday night then im looking forward to it wait ripley held up a hand what i thought it only fair that i make it up to mac for damaging his equipment ive invited him up on friday to observe a ritual ripley was speechless for a moment then she grabbed mias arm can i talk to you of course why dont you walk me to my car mia sent mac an easy smile friday after sunset you know the way obviously youve lost your mind ripley began as she accompanied mia across the shale since when do you perform for an audience hes a scientist all the more listen ripley broke off as they started up the rise to the road okay listen she started again i know youre probably a little shaken up right now and not thinking straight im fine but i appreciate your concern fine my ass ripley took three long strides away three long strides back waved her arms why dont you sell tickets hes not a gawker ripley and you know it hes an intelligent man with an open mind i trust him mia angled her head and those witchsmoke eyes were both amused and puzzled im surprised you dont its not a matter of trust but she rolled her shoulders as though she felt a twinge just take some time think it through before you do something you cant take back hes part of it mia said quietly you already know that i feel something for him not sexual she added but intimate nonetheless a warmth without heat if thered been heat id have acted on it he wasnt for me she said the last pointedly what you feel for him is different and it unsettles you if it was just sexual attraction youd have had sex with him how do you know i havent when mia merely smiled ripley cursed and this has nothing to do with anything it has all to do with everything youll make your own choices in your own time im going to ask nell to join us if shed like mia opened the car door as ripley stood and steamed youre welcome of course if i wanted to join the circus id have learned how to juggle your choice as i said she climbed in then lowered her window hes an exceptional man ripley i envy you that statement had ripleys mouth dropping open as mia drove away mac was packing up when ripley came back hed gotten all he believed he was going to get that day but he intended to return when the atmosphere wasnt quite so volatile in any case he needed to do some repairs and needed to settle himself as well when ripleys shadow crossed the opening of the cave he tucked his palmcorder into its bag you tried to talk her out of meeting with me thats right is that how you refrain from interfering in my work this is different why dont you give me your definition of interference okay youre pissed off im sorry but im not going to keep my mouth shut when someone i someone i know makes a decision because shes whacked out emotionally it isnt fair you think id take advantage of whatever it is that upset her wouldnt you he was quiet for a moment then shrugged i dont know she has several days to change her mind she made the deal shell keep it thats how she works so do you youre like two pieces of the same puzzle what caused the rift between you its old news no its not she hurt and you bled for her i watched you now youd protect her if you could he picked up two of his bags straightened youre the same with nell youre a shield for those who matter to you who stands for you ripley i can take care of myself i dont doubt it but thats not the point they stand for you and thats what you dont quite know how to handle you dont know me well enough to know what i can handle ive known you all my life she reached out to stop him before he walked outside again what is that supposed to mean i asked you once about your dreams one day ill tell you about mine hed put dreams in her mind thats what she told herself even as she was sucked into them knowing it was a dream didnt stop the action she was on the beach with a storm charging in like a runaway train and the storm was her fury there were others with her shadows and lights love and the barbed trap of its opposite a bolt sliced out of the sky a silver blade that cleaved the earth in two the world around her was madness and the taste of it wildly tempting the choice is yours now and always power snapped and stung the choice now and always she could reach out clasp the hand that beckoned that offered a bridge to the light or she could stay in the dark and feed she was hungry ripley awoke weeping with images of destruction still reeling in her mind eleven she rarely sought counsel in her experience advice was never easy to swallow but the dream had broken her back half a dozen times during the day shed nearly dumped it all on zack hed always been there for her and their friendship was as solid and true as their blood tie but she was forced to admit she wanted a womans shoulder mia and nell were out of the question they were too tightly connected but there was one who was linked to all of them and who could always be counted on to speak her mind whether or not you cared to hear it she went to lulu she waited until she thought that lulu had had time enough to get home from the bookstore but not enough to settle in too comfortably after shed waded through the lawn art adjusted her eyes to the virulent colors that lulu habitually selected to paint her house and knocked on the back door ripley was pleased to see her timing was good lulu had changed out of her work clothes into a sweatshirt that read coffee chocolate men some things are just better rich she had an unopened bottle of wine in her hand and was wearing ratty red slippers and the faintly irritated look of a woman whod been interrupted whats up with you she demanded it wasnt the warmest of welcomes but it was lulu got a minute i guess i do she turned away and clomped back to the counter for her corkscrew want a glass of this wouldnt mind it good thing i didnt light that joint ripley winced damn lu lulu let out a cackling laugh and popped the cork just kidding always could get you havent had a toke in she sighed nostalgically twentysix years your daddy was the first and last to bust me confiscated my pretty little plant and my stash told me he knew i could get more where that came from if i had a mind to or i could keep on working for mias grandmother and tending mia and he figured i had the good sense to know which i needed more always liked your daddy thats a heartwarming story lu just chokes me up lulu poured wine into two glasses then sat and propped her feet on one of the kitchen chairs what brings you to my door deputy can we start with some light conversation so i can work up to it okay lulu sipped savoring the first taste of the end of the workday hows your sex life thats sort of part of what im going to work up to never thought id see the day when leterrip came to my door for a sex talk before she could stop herself ripley squirmed jeez lu nobody calls me that anymore lulu grinned i do always did admire your upfront approach to things got man trouble baby doll sort of but nicelooking man phdeelicious lulu smacked her lips not your usual type of course kinda slow and thoughtful and a little on the sweet side not so sweet he hurts your teeth or anything just a nice flavor if i were thirty years younger yeah yeah youd have a taste of him yourself sulking ripley propped her chin on her fists dont smartass me anyway its nice to see you realize brains are sexy so hows he rate in the sack we havent been there rather than surprising her the statement confirmed lulus recent observations she set down her glass pursed her lips figured and that tells me one thing he scares you im not scared of him accusations of that nature always put ripleys back up especially when they were true im just being cautious and taking my time its complicated lulu pressed her fingertips together in a kind of prayer tent here is some wisdom of the ages grasshopper despite herself ripley grinned whos the smartass shut up and listen the wisdom is this sex is better when its complicated why because when you can snatch the pebbles out of my hand you will know the answer for yourself i really like him i mean really whats bad about that nothing i just wish sort of that wed gone ahead with it right off the bat so there wouldnt be all these jitters and wondering and buildup so it all seems so important the breath whizzed out of ripleys lungs okay yeah important worse i think he knows its important and if he does it means when it all comes down im not going to be really you know in charge lulu just sipped and waited and that sounds really stupid doesnt it okay ripley nodded oddly settled on one very important level i think maybe ive got that now theres more yeah mias going to let him observe a ritual on friday ripley blurted out and if mias involved nell will be too shes only doing it because she was upset yesterday at the cave you know the cave she got all twisted up and it doesnt matter how quick she manages to untwist again it shakes her shes just doing this to prove she can handle everything she can handle it lulu said quietly if youd stuck with her all those years ago youd have a better grip on what she can handle i couldnt thats done matters more what youre going to do now i dont know what to do thats the whole thing are you looking for me to tell you ripley lifted her glass i guess i wanted to know what youd say what you thought this messes me up lu its coming back on me in me oh fuck i dont know how to explain it i wanted it to go away i made it go away now its like there are these little openings all over the place and i cant plug them all it never did sit comfortable on you some things arent meant to be comfortable maybe i was worried it would get too comfortable i dont have mias control or nells compassion i dont have those things circles lulu thought they always came around no what youve got is passion and an innate sense of right and wrong and a need to see it served up thats why the three of you make the circle ripley bringing to it the best of yourselves or the worst and that was her fear her terror thats the way it went down three hundred years ago if you buy into it you cant change what was but you can whats coming but you cant hide from either it sounds to me like youre thinking youve been hiding out long enough i never thought of it as hiding im not a coward even after we dealt with remington i could pretty much pull it back maintain the status quo but since mac it keeps slipping out of my fingers so youre worried that if youre with him you wont be able to pull anything back not just what you are but what you feel thats about it so youre going to tiptoe around lulu let out a huff of breath shook her head worry and fret and whatnot about what might be instead of swinging into the saddle and finding out what is i dont want to hurt the ones who matter to me doing nothing sometimes hurts more than doing something life doesnt come with a guarantee which is just as well because most guarantees are bullshit well when you put it that way there was nothing and no one like lulu ripley thought for clearing out the murk i guess ive been on the edge of doing something for a while now and not doing it is making me crazy and stupid she added as she would have said to few others you gonna take that last step now ripley drummed her fingers on the table then sighed lets say im going to take a step and see what happens next can i use the phone what for i need to call in a pizza order it took mac most of the day to fix the sensor and even then it was only juryrigged it would take a day or two to get the replacement parts and with friday looming he was in a crunch im not sure what to expect on friday he wrote its better that way its a mistake to go into an experience anticipating specific results closes off the mind to possibilities i do now have a theory on the events in the logan cave the gaelic phrase carved into the cave wall translates to my heart is your heart ever and always while it will take time to ascertain the age of the carving i continue to believe it was made within the last twenty years based on that the location of the cave and mia devlins reaction to finding me and ripley there its a logical assumption that the cave has particular and personal meaning for her the carving i believe was done by her or for her the logans had a son samuel who was raised on the island no one speaks of him in connection with mia its a studied deliberate omission which naturally leads me to conclude that he and mia devlin were involved most probably were lovers before he moved offisland this in turn may be the foundation for the last step of the legend which is mirrored by the descendants of the original sisters nell to zack being the first and hypothetically mia to logan being the last which leaves ripley in the middle ripley and his fingers fumbled so he stopped sat back rubbed his eyes under his glasses he reached absently for his coffee mug and knocked it off the table the obligatory cleanup gave his system time to settle im connected to the pattern he continued i sensed it before i came here and with the documents ive yet to share with the others ive formed certain theories but theories and reality are different matters with different effects on those involved on me its more difficult than id imagined to maintain objectivity to stay in the role of observer documenter when i cant stop thinking about her trying to separate feelings from professional judgment is hard enough but how can i be sure those feelings dont stem from professional interest and glands he muttered but he didnt write that down does deputy ripley todd fascinate me because she has a preternatural gift that has come down to her over three centuries or because shes a woman who has managed to attract me on every possible level im beginning to think its both and that im already in too deep to care where these feelings come from he sat back again and as his concentration level dipped he tuned in to the beeps and buzzes of his equipment in the living room he shoved away from the little desk rapping his knee sharply on its underside then limped cursing out of his office ripley stood inside the door scowling at his machines dont you ever turn these things off no he had to resist rubbing his stomach it ached just looking at her i knocked i was in the office working didnt hear you youre lucky im persistent she held up the cardboard box she carried pizza delivery large and loaded as requested in the mood his mouth watered and his belly tightened it so happens ive been craving a pizza for weeks now me too she set it down on top of what happened to be a machine that cost in the high six figures she shrugged out of her coat and let it fall on the floor she pulled off her cap tossed it in the general direction of her coat as she walked toward him hungry oh yeah good im starved she leaped hitching herself up wrapping her legs around his waist and crushing her mouth down on his he stumbled back two full steps every rational thought slipped out of his brain and drained out of his ears sex now she said breathless as she raced her lips over his face bit his neck pizza later good for you excellent he staggered toward the bedroom made it as far as the doorway before he had to brace her against the jamb just let me he changed the angle of the kiss sinking deep until her moan echoed his i taste you all the time he scraped his teeth along her throat all the time drives me crazy me too i want you naked she began to tug at his sweatshirt wait slow down why laughing she did tormenting things to his ear with her tongue because jesus because ive been thinking about this a while his fingers dug into her hips as he started toward the bed feels like centuries i dont want to rush it he managed to get a handful of her hair to draw her head back until their eyes met i want to savor it savor you i want he leaned in nibbled at her mouth to take years to make love with you to touch you he continued as he lowered her to the bed taste you gently he lifted her arms over her head she quivered beneath him you talk a good game she managed for a geek lets see how it plays he traced the exposed line of her belly when her sweater rode up with a little teamwork he lowered his head and at the last instant angled away so his lips rubbed over her jaw her body was taut under his pumping off energy in almost visible waves he wanted that all of that but first he wanted her limp weak and stunned from pleasure her hands flexed under his but she didnt struggle her heart pounded against his and her lips yielded when he asked for them that alone was arousing knowing she would let him set both pace and tone she was strong enough what she felt was strong enough to give him that gift now he would show her he treasured it shed never known a man who could light so many fires with his mouth alone even as she yearned for his hands her bones her muscles melted under the heat she sighed and surrendered to it her pulse thickened her mind blurred when he released her hands her arms felt soft heavy she lifted them slipping off his glasses tossing them aside so she could frame his face to bring his mouth back to hers again he touched her now a skim and glide of fingers as he inched her sweater up off a lazy journey over her breasts just at the edge of her bra then a teasing dance over the center clasp she tugged his sweatshirt off let her hands roam in turn then his mouth came to hers again and brought out a quiet sound of pleasure weightless she floated on the kiss she nuzzled stroked contented as a cat when his mouth skimmed the curve of her shoulder shivered lightly in anticipation as his tongue trailed down the side of her neck moaned when it dipped under cotton to tease her nipple then cried out arching helplessly as his mouth closed hot and hungry over her breast she fought for breath for balance her fingers dug into the bedclothes as her system was plunged abruptly from contentment to desperation it was like throwing open a door to a furnace he thought a man could be consumed by all that heat still he craved more he snapped open her bra found flesh he felt her gather beneath him storm clouds merging into one electric mass and shuddered at her strangled cry of release as she went limp again he moved down her down the lean taut lines of disciplined female form angles and curves dips and lovely lovely lines he wanted to wallow in them exploit them absorb them the jump of her pulse here then here matched the leap of his own and the taste of her grew warmer stronger until he wondered how hed ever lived without it she was helpless had never been helpless had never been taken with such ruthless patience he owned her and there was a thrill in it in knowing she would let him do anything he pleased in knowing she would enjoy it her skin was damp hot it seemed he knew every nerve in her body and would send each quivering one by one she reached for him opened to him gave to him with a freedom shed never felt for another every move seemed impossibly slow as if they swam through water his body trembled for hers his heart raced she felt it all and the tensing bunch of his muscles under her stroking hands when his senses were full of her the scent the flavor the texture he rose over her waiting waiting until those eyes clouded now with pleasure opened he slid into her deep deeper he took her long slow thrusts until her breath began to sob and his blood to pound he watched the pulse in the lovely line of her throat rage as she came again her arms slid bonelessly from around him i cant just let me he replied as he pressed his mouth to hers again let me as if spellbound she rose with him fell with him and felt the impossible need build yet again go with me she gripped his hips groaned as she felt herself being swept up one more time he already was his world wavered burying his face in the dark spread of her hair he lost himself she felt perfect as if her skin had turned to velvet dusted with gold every ounce of tension had drained away in fact she didnt see how she could possibly worry about anything ever again great sex she decided was the best of all possible drugs she wasnt much of a cuddler afterward and had never been big on pillow talk but here she was wrapped cozily around mac snuggled in because it felt exactly right her legs were tangled with his her head cradled on his shoulder her arm hooked around his neck what made it even better was the way he held on to her as if he was just as content to stay there for the next two or three years himself did you learn some of those moves by studying the sexual habits of primitive societies he rubbed his cheek against her hair i like to think i put my own spin on them you do good work right back at you i threw your glasses on the floor you want to watch out you dont step on them sure i meant to tell you something before what youre beautiful get out youre in a sexual haze you have all this dense dark hair and i keep wanting to bite that heavy top lip of yours add that really swell body and its a great package when she tipped her head up and stared at him he blinked until he had her in focus what he asked im just trying to think whens the last time i heard anyone use the word swell that way in a sentence youre really weird mac cute but weird she lifted her head just enough to nip at him need fuel she said want pizza okay ill get it nope i brought it ill get it you just stay where you are and stay naked she added as she rolled over him and off the bed by the way youve got a really swell body too she strolled into the other room stretched luxuriously limber and naked she went into the kitchen for a couple of beers to go with the pizza she grabbed a pile of napkins then did a quick spin could she feel any better she wondered not just the sex she thought with a dreamy sigh that would have embarrassed her if she hadnt been so loose it was mac he was so sweet and smart so steady without being boring or stuffy about it she loved listening to him watching the way his mouth quirked just a little higher on the left corner than the right when he grinned and the way his eyes got all blurred and unfocused when he was thinking the way his hair all dark blond and thick was never quite tidy then there was all that fascinating intensity balanced by the easy humor he was the first man shed ever let herself be involved with she admitted who had so many layers he wasnt simple and didnt expect her to be and wasnt that lovely with the bottles clanging cheerfully together she wandered back into the living room to retrieve the pizza happiness soared through her and before she realized what was happening her heart did a slow turn a kind of waltz then suddenly fell her eyes popped wide oh my god before she could react to the abrupt and slightly terrifying realization that shed fallen in love every machine in the cottage went into action her head rang with the sound of them beeping squealing buzzing humming needles whipped lights flashed and she stood frozen in shock mac gave a shout and leaped out of bed he sprinted toward the living room tripped over a pair of sneakers and went sprawling cursing he scrambled up and ran naked into the room whatd you touch whatd you do nothing nothing ripley gripped the bottles like lifelines later she told herself much later she would look back at this and it would all be so ridiculous shed crack a rib laughing but for now she could only stare as mac rushed from machine to machine calling out readings actually patting his naked body as if he might find a pocket in his skin where a pencil was hiding man man would you look at this he pulled up sheets of paper holding them almost to his nose as he scanned the printout major events the first one nearly an hour ago i think i cant read the time cant see a fucking thing on the graphs where the hell are my glasses holy cow fried another sensor this is great mac yeah uhhuh he waved a hand at her as if she were a vaguely annoying fly i just want to rewind the videotape see if there were any visible manifestations youd better put some clothes on because youre a little vulnerable to injury at the moment hmm what was that he asked distractedly why dont we both get dressed and ill let you get back to your work only an idiot he thought would turn a naked woman away to play with toys especially when the woman was deputy ripley todd dr macallister booke was no idiot no lets have pizza he picked up the box and the scent of it of her stirred his appetite again ill go over the data tomorrow its not going anywhere he went to her skimmed his knuckles over her cheek i dont want you going anywhere either fair enough she decided she would go over her internal data tomorrow too watch your step this time i dont want you falling on the box and smashing dinner ordering herself to settle down she walked with him back to the bedroom howd you get the scar on your butt oh i sort of fell off a cliff jesus mac they settled on the bed the pizza between them and she handed him a beer only you she hadnt meant to stay sleeping over was entirely different in ripleys view from sleeping with it added another layer of intimacy that too often got sticky but somehow without her being entirely sure how he managed it she ended up squeezing into the tiny shower with him the next morning he proved to be very adept in tight places as a result she was feeling loose a bit muggy in the brain and vaguely embarrassed when she let herself into her own house her hope was to sneak upstairs change into sweats for a run on the beach and act as if nothing much had happened that hope was dashed as nell called out from the kitchen is that you ripley coffees fresh damn it she muttered under her breath and reluctantly changed directions she was mortally afraid there was about to be a girl talk and hadnt a clue how she should handle it there nell was working in the kitchen that was alive with the homey scents of baking looking daffodilfresh as she filled another round of muffin tins one look and ripley felt bedraggled awkward and ravenous want breakfast nell asked cheerfully well maybe no she sucked it in i really want to get a run in first ah i guess i shouldve called last night to let you know i wouldnt be home oh thats all right mac called i just didnt think in the act of reaching into the fridge for a bottle of water she froze mac called yes he thought we might worry he thought ripley repeated which made her what an inconsiderate idiot what did he say that the two of you were having hot monkey sex and not to worry she glanced up from her muffins dimples flashing as she laughed uproariously at the horrified shock on ripleys face he just said you were with him i inferred the hot monkey sex arent you a laugh riot in the morning ripley countered and twisted the top off the water bottle i didnt know hed called you i should have done it it doesnt matter did you have a good time im walking in at what seven fortyfive in the morning you should be able to infer something from that i would except you seem a little cranky im not cranky scowling ripley glugged down water okay it just seems to me that he could have told me he was going to call you or suggested i call you but either way that wouldve been assuming i intended to stay the night which i didnt but which he obviously decided i was going to which is pretty pushy if you ask me because it wasnt as if he actually asked me to stay in the first damn place nell waited a beat huh i dont know i dont know what i just said god irritated with herself she ran the cold bottle over her forehead im just weirded out over stuff over him yes i dont know maybe ive got all these feelings piling up and im not ready for them i need to run ive done a lot of running myself nell said quietly i mean on the beach at nells sympathetic nod ripley sighed okay i get you but its too early for metaphors then let me ask one straight question are you happy with him yeah ripleys stomach tied itself into slippery knots yeah i am it wouldnt hurt to just go with that for a while and see what happens next maybe i would maybe i could but ive figured out that hes always one step ahead of me sneaky bastard she gave up sat i think im in love with him oh ripley nell leaned down took ripleys face in her hands so do i i dont want to be i know ripley hissed out a breath how do you know so damn much ive been where you are and not so long ago its scary and exciting and it just changes everything i liked things the way they were dont tell zack she said then immediately regretted it what am i saying of course youll tell zack its like a rule just maybe give it a few days first i may get over this okay nell walked over to transfer baking trays it could be ive just got the hots for him and its messing me up i suppose and if last nights any indication well probably burn each other out in a couple of weeks max it happens ripley tapped her fingers on the table if youre just going to stand over there and humor the fool im changing im going for my run nell set the muffins on the rack to cool totally content with herself as ripley stormed out go ahead and run she said softly bet he catches you twelve considering that he was criminally insane evan remington had his good days he could depending on what pictures were wheeling through his mind be fairly lucid even momentarily charming there were moments according to one of the nurses harding interviewed when you could see the sly intellect that had made him a top hollywood power broker other times he just sat and drooled to harding he had become a fascination that was edging toward an obsession remington was a man in his prime by all accounts a brilliant operator of the entertainment machine one who had come from wealth and privilege and yet hed been brought to nothing by a woman the woman was also a fascination a quiet biddable little mouse if you accepted the opinion of many whod known her during her marriage a courageous survivor who had escaped a nightmare if you went with the popular feminist take harding wasnt convinced that she was either but he was willing to consider she was something more there were so many angles there beauty and the beast destroyed by love the monster behind the mask already he had mountains of notes reams of tape photographs copies of police and medical reports he also had the beginnings of a rough first draft of the book he was certain would make him very rich and very famous what he didnt have as yet were solid personal interviews with the key players he was willing to invest a lot of time and effort into acquiring them while he followed nells trail across the country forming impressions gathering data he flew back to visit remington regularly and each time he did he was fueled with more purpose more ambition and an underlying anger that baffled him the anger would fade but it came back stronger every time most of the travel was dumped on his expense account and though he shot off stories to the magazine he was well aware that there would come a day of reckoning he was already dipping into his personal funds couldnt seem to stop himself whereas once he had been proud of his magazine work had enjoyed even thrived on the pace and demands of it he now found himself resenting every hour he had to spend fulfilling his professional obligations the remington todd story was like a fever burning in him on valentines day and he would always find that wonderfully ironic he made his first real connection with evan remington they think im crazy it was the first time remington had spoken to him without prompting it took everything harding had not to jump at the quiet reasonable sound of his voice he gazed at the recorder to be sure the tape was running who thinks that the people here my traitorous sister my adulterous wife have you met my wife mr harding something icy seemed to slick the inside of hardings gut at being called by name he had introduced himself on every visit but hed never believed never really considered that remington had heard or understood no i havent i was hoping you would tell me about her what can i tell you about helen there was a sigh a sound of patient amusement she deceived me shes a whore a cheat a liar but shes my whore i gave her everything i made her beautiful she belongs to me has she tried to seduce you the spit in hardings mouth dried up ridiculous as it seemed it felt as if remington could see into his mind i havent met your wife mr remington i hope to have the opportunity to meet her when i do id be happy to take her a message from you oh i have plenty to say to helen but its private he said whispering the last word as a slow smile curved his lips many things between a man and his wife should be private dont you agree what happens between them in the sanctity of their home is no ones concern harding offered a sympathetic nod its difficult isnt it to balance that privacy when youre a man who has the publics attention remingtons eyes clouded fog over ice and began to dart around the room the intelligence the crafty humor in them had vanished i need a phone i seem to have misplaced my phone wheres the damn concierge im sure hell be right here could i ask you what it was about mrs remington that first attracted you to her she was pure simple like clay waiting to be formed i knew immediately she was meant to be mine i sculpted her his hands flexed at the ends of his restraints i didnt know how deeply flawed she was how much work would be involved i devoted myself to her he leaned forward his body vibrating as it strained do you know why she ran why because shes weak and stupid weak and stupid weak and stupid he said it again and again like a chant as his fisted hands pounded i found her because im not he turned his wrist as if checking the rolex that was no longer there its time i left here isnt it time i fetched helen and took her home she has a lot of explaining to do call the bellman for my bags hes on his way tell me what happened that night on three sisters island i dont remember anyway its not important i have a plane to catch theres plenty of time harding kept his voice low and soothing as remington began to squirm in his chair you went to find helen she was living on the island you must have been pleased to find her alive living in a hovel hardly more than a tool shed little bitch pumpkins on the porch a cat in the house something wrong with the house he licked his lips it doesnt want me to be there the house didnt want you she cut her hair i didnt give her permission to do that she whored herself she has to be punished has to be taught has to remember whos in charge she makes me hurt her remington shook his head she begs for it she asked you to hurt her harding asked cautiously something stirred in him something ugly and unrecognizable something that was aroused by the thought it shocked and appalled him nearly made him pull back once more but then remington was speaking she doesnt learn can she be that dense of course not she enjoys punishment she ran when i killed her lover but he came back from the dead remington went on i had a right to kill him for trying to take what belonged to me a right to kill them both who are all those people what people in the woods remington said impatiently the women in the woods where did they come from what business is this of theirs and him why didnt he die when i killed him what kind of world is this what happened in the woods the woods he rubbed his lips together as his breath began to rush through them there are monsters in the woods beasts hiding behind my face crawling inside me light in a circle fire too many voices screaming who is that screaming hang the witch thou shalt not suffer a witch to live kill them all before its too late he was screaming now howling like a madman as aides rushed in ordered harding to leave he picked up his tape recorder with a trembling hand and didnt see the crafty gleam in remingtons eyes ripley slogged her way through paperwork shed lost the coin toss with zack which still irritated her since the false spring was hanging on it would be close to sixty degrees by afternoon and she was stuck on desk duty the only good part was that he wasnt around so she was free to sulk and call him nasty names under her breath when the door of the station house opened she prepared to launch a few at him facetoface but it was mac who walked in behind what looked to be most of hollands supply of tulips whatre you doing going into the florist business no he crossed to her held out the rainbow of spring flowers happy valentines day oh well wow even as her heart went soft as putty her stomach jumped um you say thanks and kiss me now mac told her helpfully thanks there were so many of them she had to hold them out to the side before she could manage the kiss and when she would have kept that part of the ritual light he simply slid his arms around her drew her closer sucked her down into that soft slippery world there are a lot of flowers he rubbed his lips over hers stirring them both say thanks again th he took the kiss deeper until her skin was humming and shed risen to her toes that ought to cover it he ran his hands up and down her sides i guess she had to clear her throat theyre really pretty she felt silly holding them sillier still because she wanted to bury her face in them and sniff like a puppy but you didnt have to bring me flowers i dont really go in for the whole valentines gig yeah crass commercialism and blah blah so what he made her laugh and she stopped feeling silly theres a hell of a lot of them the florist must have fallen weeping to his knees when you walked out let me see if weve got something around here to hold them she had to settle for a plastic scrub bucket but did indulge herself with some sniffing and sighing as she filled it with water from the bathroom tap ill do better by them when i take them home she promised as she carried them back out i didnt know tulips came in so many colors i guess i havent paid attention my mom goes for tulips she what do you call it forces the bulbs in little glass jars every winter ripley set the makeshift vase on the desk i bet you sent your mother flowers today sure did she looked at him shook her head youre a hell of a sweetheart dr booke think so he dug in his pocket frowned dug in the other and came up with a little candy heart then dropped it into ripleys palm be mine she read and felt that little jitter in the belly again so how about it he reached around to tug on her ponytail are you going to be my valentine boy youre really into this looks like youve got me now im going to have to go buy you a mushy card its the least you can do he continued to play with the sleek tail of hair listen about tonight i didnt realize it was valentines day when i made the arrangements with mia if you want i can reschedule that and we can go out to dinner take a drive whatever youd like oh it was friday she remembered shed done her best to block that particular fact out of her head now he was giving her the perfect way to put it all off to put off something that was important to his work yep she thought with an inward sigh the man was a sweetheart no dont worry about it its already set up you could come with me when she started to turn away he kept her in place with his hand on her hair turning a tender gesture into a nononsense one with a simple flexing of fingers i dont know what im going to do dont count on me whatever you say he hated to see her struggle but knew of no way to smooth it all away there are some things i want to talk to you about if you decide to give the session at mias a pass can you come by the cottage afterward what things well talk about it he gave her hair a last tug before walking to the door ripley he paused his hand on the knob and looked at her a gun at her hip a pail of tulips at her side i know were standing on opposite sides of a line in one area as long as we understand why and accept that accept each other were okay youre so damn stable hey my parents spent a lot of money to make sure of it shrinks she said and worked up a sneer for him damn right see you later yeah she murmured when the door closed behind him problem was she wasnt quite so stable not quite so okay because she was crazy about him it was difficult for a woman to maintain her dignity and reputation as somewhat of a hardass when she was walking around with a bucket full of tulips it was damn near impossible when that same woman got caught perusing a dwindling display of sentimental valentines day cards i like this one gladys macey reached around her and tapped a huge card with an enormous pink heart ripley did her best not to squirm yeah i picked it out for carl a week ago and he liked it fine when i gave it to him this morning men like big cards must make them feel more manly having no doubt that gladys knew more about such matters than she did ripley plucked the card out of the slot last one she commented lucky me lucky you indeed gladys bent down to admire the tulips must be four dozen tulips in there five ripley corrected okay shed counted she couldnt help it five dozen mmm and they cost the earth this time of year pretty as a picture though you get candy too ripley thought of the little heart that shed tucked in her pocket sort of candy too gladys nodded wisely the mans smitten ripley nearly bobbled the bucket what did you say i said the mans smitten smitten something tickled ripleys throat but she wasnt sure if it was panic or humor that words getting around these days why do you think that well for heavens sake ripley a man doesnt buy a woman flowers give her candy and so forth on valentines day because he wants a canasta partner what makes young people so thickheaded about these things i just figured he was one of those people who make hallmark stand up and cheer men dont make grand gestures unless theyre reminded to in trouble guilty or smitten gladys ticked these possibilities off on her fingers with nails newly polished in valentine red not in my experience did you remind him what day it was no i forgot about it myself you have a spat no ripley conceded anything you can think of for him to be guilty about no theres nothing in particular for him to feel guilty about well then where does that leave him according to your lineup smitten shed have to think about it she studied the card in her hand so they like the big ones absolutely you put those flowers in something pretty now theyre too sweet to stay in that old bucket she gave ripley a pat on the shoulder then wandered off as soon as she could manage it gladys would be spreading the word that the village deputy was sweet on the mainlander and vice versa the mainlander was back at work hed studied organized and logged the varied data that had come through on the night he and ripley had been together he was formulating theories hypotheses and working toward logical conclusions he hadnt noted the time when he and ripley had made love his mind had been on more important matters nor had he clocked the duration but his printouts assuming that his theories on energy dispersal were correct pinned it down for him the machines had picked up burst after burst spikes long steady rises fluctuations wasnt it interesting that he hadnt heard the clatter of them as they recorded hed been so completely absorbed in her now he could look at the tangible record of what theyd brought to each other it was oddly arousing he measured distances between the spikes and rises calculated the valleys between energy peaks and the output of each then he had to get up and walk around until he could stop imagining her naked and concentrate on science long steady holding pattern here lowgrade energy levels he crunched on an apple pushed up his glasses afterglow period were just lying there now languor pillow talk makes sense so why does it start building again here it was almost like steps he noted a rise a plateau a rise a plateau he tried to think shed gotten up gone for the pizza into the kitchen for a couple of beers maybe shed been thinking about making love again he didnt mind thinking she was it was a nice boost to the ego but it didnt explain the abrupt and violent energy flash nothing steplike there it had been like a rocket going off nothing he could find indicated that it came from an outside source or an underlying well of energy to his best recollection hed been in a kind of twilight sleep just sort of floating while he waited for her hed been thinking about the pizza about eating it in bed with her naked it had been a pleasant image but he hadnt been the cause of this therefore ripley had but how and why were the puzzles an aftershock sort of thing that was possible but aftershocks were rarely as powerful as the initial quake and this one punched right through the ceiling if he could recreate the event that was a thought of course he would need to find a delicate way to propose that to her they had a lot to talk about he bit into the apple again and felt happy just remembering the stunned look on her face when hed walked in with all those flowers he liked surprising her that way then watching her deal with it he just liked watching her he wondered how much work it was going to be for him to talk her into taking a trip with him maybe in the spring before he had to buckle down and turn his data and theories and conclusions into a book they could make a quick stop in new york he wanted her to meet his family then they could take a few days somewhere anywhere she wanted he wasnt particular some time alone with her away from work it might help him evaluate another hypothesis he was working on that he was falling in love with her ripley decided to keep her distance from whatever was going to happen at mias that evening since zack had chosen to go along she would have the house to herself for a change she could take advantage of that by turning the tv up too loud eating junk food and watching a really bad action movie on cable shed been spending nearly all her free time with mac and maybe that was part of the problem a little alone time in her own space was just what she needed she would work off some energy lifting weights take a long hot shower then settle in with popcorn loaded with salt and butter and watch tv with her pals lucy and diego she turned the music up to earsplitting in the spare room she used for workouts then with the dog and cat trailing her walked into the bedroom to change into her gear and there were the tulips the charming explosion of them taking over her dresser the air was sweet with them valentines days just a racket she said out loud then gave up but it really works she picked up the card shed bought for mac it wouldnt take her very long to run over to the cottage slip it under his door in fact it would probably be better if she didnt have to give him something so well mushy facetoface and she could add a little note saying that she would see him tomorrow the more shed thought about it the less she wanted to talk about whatever it was he wanted to talk about when he was still pumped from his witch session she didnt care if it was unfair or unrealistic or even stupid for now for a while longer she wanted to keep whatever it was they felt for each other separate from his work and her gift shed never been in love before what was wrong with holding on to that for a while and putting off the rest okay back in ten she told lucy and diego no smoking drinking or making long distance calls while im gone she grabbed the card and headed toward the door leading out to the deck and stepped out onto the beach into a rising storm the wind slashed the icy tip of a whip the air was blue with lightning she was spinning spinning through it flying on a current of power that pulsed in a thousand heartbeats over her skin the circle was a white flame on the sand she was in it and above it outside it three figures ringed inside it she saw herself who was not herself link hands with her sisters and the chants that rose up hummed inside her she saw herself yet not herself standing alone beyond that bright circle arms lifted hands empty and the grief shot up out of that lonely heart into her own she saw herself as she was as she could be alive in that storm beyond the circle where her sisters waited rage and power twisted inside her one man cowered at her feet and another ran toward her in the violent dark but she could not be reached would not be reached in her hand was the bright silver sword of justice with a cry she brought it down and destroyed them all she awoke sprawled on the deck shuddering helplessly in the balmy night her skin was damp and there was the electric smell of ozone stinging the air her stomach spasmed as she pushed herself to her hands and knees too weak to stand she stayed there rocking gently taking gulping breaths to feed her starved lungs the roaring in her head subsided and became the endless rolling of the sea it had never come on her like that never so abruptly so physically not even when she was practicing when she had willingly sought such things she wanted to crawl back into her room to curl up on the rug in the dark and whimper like a baby it was the small pitiful sounds coming from her own throat that made her force herself up until she was kneeling until she was breathing deep and steady again with the vision still pounding at her she scrambled to her feet and ran thirteen are you sure you want to do this nell linked her hand with zacks deliberately slowing the pace thin clouds sailed overhead filtering the starlight the fat curve of moon was a soft and waiting white she knew her way in the dark through mias gardens past her jutting cliffs and into the winter forest with her hand warm in zacks she let mia and mac pull ahead she could hear mias voice like a light trail of music slip back through the trees and shadows would you rather i stayed behind no its just that youve never come with me before you never asked me before her fingers curled in his she stopped she could see him clearly enough she could always see him clearly it wasnt that you werent welcome in the starlight she saw his brows arch and she smiled exactly in a slow easy movement he lifted their joined hands to his lips does my being here make you uncomfortable not uncomfortable a little nervous maybe because she was she touched him just a skim of her fingers over his arm im not sure how you might react how youll feel about this part of me nell he put his hands on her shoulders gave them a little rub im not darren who you know darren bewitched you twitch your nose and i get all grumpy about it it took her a minute then she wrapped her arms around his waist nerves doubts worries were completely swamped by joy i really love you i know there is one thing i was going to be openminded and not bring it up but he glanced over to where mac had disappeared into the dark with mia ive read up on rituals and magic and that sort of thing and i know that sometimes they involve getting naked i dont care how stupid it sounds but i want you to keep your clothes on when macs around she tried to hide her amusement hes a scientist like a doctor i dont give a rats ass in this particular area im darren well darren its not warm enough to go skyclad and to be perfectly frank i keep my clothes on even when its just me and mia apparently im a very prudish witch suits me they began to walk again with him letting her lead the way so does mia get naked skyclad nell corrected and i dont see why youd be interested purely from an academic standpoint yeah right they were still teasing each other as they stepped into the clearing shadows gray as smoke ringed the edges hanks of dried herbs and chains of crystals hung from the bare branches of the trees a trio of stones rose up in a kind of altar mac crouched in front of it busily taking readings mia had denied him his video camera and tape recorder no amount of persuasion had moved her on that point but she had permitted his sensors and his notebook and his mind mia had already set down the bag she carried and now walked over to zack to take the one hed brought for nell lets give our scientist a moment to play shall we she gestured toward mac hes so happy then she slipped an arm around nells shoulders theres no need to be nervous little sister it just feels a little odd and im still new to all this your man stands with you you come here already more powerful than you were the first time and more aware of self she shifted her gaze to zack studied his face cant you feel his pride in you in all that you are there are some who never have that vital magic without it the lights never quite bright enough as much to bolster herself as nell she gave nells shoulders a little squeeze before going to join mac shes so lonely nell confided to zack she doesnt think it and shes so confident so complete no one sees it but there are times shes so lonely it makes me ache youre a good friend nell mia laughed at something mac said then spun away from him it wasnt quite a dance mac would think later but still somehow balletic her long gray dress billowed then settled as she lifted her arms and her voice rich and full was the music this is our place the place of the three it was conjured from need and knowledge from hope and despair from power turned away from death and fear and ignorance this is our place she repeated passed down to us the three to the three for tonight we are two mac got slowly to his feet she was changing in front of him her hair was more vivid her skin sheening like marble her already staggering beauty increased as if some thin veil had been lifted he wondered if she used her magic to enhance what she had now or if she used her gift to dim it at other times and he cursed the lack of recording equipment we come here to give thanks to honor those who came before to offer and remember this ground is sacred you are welcome here macallister booke when youre invited i wont insult you by asking for your promise not to come here otherwise you have it anyway she inclined her head a regal acknowledgment zack you are nells and this place is hers as much as mine so its yours you can ask questions if you like she added as she bent to open her bag i imagine dr booke has most of the answers because the request was implied mac crossed over and stood with the other man the candles theyre getting out are ritual candles i imagine theyve already been consecrated and inscribed theyre using silver representing the goddess female power the symbols on them he edged a little closer squinted ah yeah the four elements earth air fire water mia wouldnt tell me what ritual theyd do tonight but from the setup its probably a call to the four elements an offering of respect he continued maybe a request for dream interpretation or clairvoyance those are represented by the silver candles too its an attractive ritual youve seen it before zack watched his wife remove a knife with a curved handle a goblet a wooden wand with a crystal tip from her bag yeah if the ritual generates enough power you may feel a little tingle in the air even without that my sensors will pick up the energy increase theyll cast a circle and light the candles with wooden matches matches zack felt his face split into a grin brother keep watching amused now and fascinated by his wife zack slipped his hands into his pockets rocked back on his heels mac scribbled in his notebook as they cast the circle it was a fairly standard casting little variation on the other chants and movements hed observed too bad its cloudy he commented as he checked the new reading on his sensor we could use more light even as he spoke a thin line of silver shimmered over the ground a perfect circle of light jeez with equal parts shock and fascination he took a step forward notebook forgotten from the center of the circle mia and nell set the candles alight with no more than a sweep of arm i thought youd seen this deal before zack said not like this never like this catching himself ogling he pulled himself back and got to work we are two mia said and we bring two more one for love and one for knowledge one to be cherished the other to be sought she picked up her wand such things are tools she said conversationally now tools are to be respected she opened a small jar and took out a handful of petals iris for wisdom from another nell took a sprig of rosemary and this for love she took up her ritual knife and used the tip to draw symbols on the earth and here we twine them here we bind them love and knowledge blessed with hope within the circle and without sought and cherished they conquer fear and vanquish doubt hearts and minds open and free mia continued sprinkling herbs and flowers into a wide bowl only then can we meet our destinies because these things we both hold dear we allow two to witness what we do here in this place and on this night we open our ritual to their sight this i do willingly as do i nell responded all right then any questions professor ive never seen that particular ritual just a little precaution we wouldnt want you to be taken as peeping toms consider it a kind of warmup act for the main performance still youre not to attempt to enter the circle or even approach it once we begin understood oh yeah then one more mac lifted a finger ask mia said with a nod what is this place mia held out a hand palm up fingers gently cupped as if she held something precious the air mac would have sworn it pulsed it is she said quietly the heart then she lowered her hand mia nodded at nell blessed be little sister nell drew in breath held it as she lifted her arms i call to air both restless and sweet on her breast my wings will beat rise and turn and blow your breath warm come stir the wind but do no harm i am air she called out as the hanging crystals began to sing and she is me as i will so mote it be the wind swirled dancing in the once still night mac could smell the sea in it feel it whisper then rush over his face and hair amazing was the best he could do and watched mia mirror nells gesture before she picked up the chant i call to fire her heat and light in her heart life burns strong and bright flame like the sun bring harm to none i am fire and she is me as i will so mote it be the silver candles sprang like torches and the shimmering circle rose like a flaming wall macs sensors rang like alarms for the first time in his long career he gave them not a thought the pencil he held slipped unnoticed out of his fingers he could feel the heat see through it the women behind that sheer fiery curtain glowed just as brightly and the wind sang like a woman in love within the circle nell and mia turned to each other clasped hands ripley rocketed out of the woods mac caught only a glimpse her pale pale face dark eyes then she was diving into the fire no with images of her burning he leaped forward stay back mia snapped out the order even as she knelt beside ripley damn it shes hurt mac lifted one unsteady hand pressed against an invisible barrier it sparked hissed but wouldnt give way nothing hed seen or done had prepared him to stand helpless behind magic unable to reach the woman he loved break the circle he demanded let me through this isnt for you she is he curled his fists against the shield ignoring the heat that radiated from it nell zack strained at the edge of the fire he felt the scorch of its power and for the first time a ripple of fear its all right shes safe here i promise watching her husband she cradled his sisters head please you know better mias voice was steady even as she brushed back ripleys hair even as she watched ripleys eyes clear her heart thudded i wasnt prepared for you nor you for this dont scold her shes shaking what is it ripley nell asked what happened shaking her head ripley struggled to her knees i cant control it i couldnt stop it i dont know what to do tell me mia insisted as she gave a worried glance toward the men her will and her wall wouldnt hold them out much longer no defense lasted against love and be quick a vision hit me like a fist what was what might be its bad its me she moaned and sank into a ball it hurts you know what needs to be done no you know mia repeated and ruthlessly dragged her up again you came youre here and you know what you have to do for this for now the rest comes when it comes her stomach pitched cramped i dont want this and still you came to save us well save yourself first do it now her breath was coming in ragged gasps and the look she shot mia was anything but friendly but she held out a hand well damn it help me up i wont do it on my knees nell took one hand mia the other and when ripley stood on her feet they let her go i dont remember the words yes you do stop stalling ripley hissed out a breath her throat was so tight it stung and her stomach was alive with cramps i call to earth generous and deep in her we sow that we may reap she felt the power rising swayed with it mia finish give us your charm and bring no harm i am earth and she is me as i will so mote it be power gushed into her flooded out the pain the ground at her feet sprang with flowers and the last mia gripped her hand firmly took nells they were linked a circle within a circle we are the three we call to water stream and sea within her great heart nell continued life came to be with your soft rain bring no harm no pain ripley lifted her face and joined her sisters in the last of the chant we are water and she is we as we will so mote it be rain fell soft as silk and bright as silver we are the three mia said again quietly so that only nell and ripley could hear because he had no choice mac waited until the ritual was complete and the circle closed the minute he could reach her he grabbed ripleys arms a shock of electricity jolted through his hands but he held on are you okay yes i need to dont pull away from me his voice carried an undertone of steel i wouldnt pull if you didnt grab i beg your pardon he said and released her look damn it she poked at his arm as he turned away im a little churned up right now i could use a few minutes to settle down take all the time you need ive got plenty to do he walked back to pick up his notebook check his equipment that was unkind of you mia scolded dont hassle me now suit yourself were going back to the house youre welcome of course or you can go to the devil which often suits you as well she shot her nose in the air and walked off to join mac hey zack stepped to her ran a hand through her hair then framed her face scared me scared me too keeping that in mind you might want to cut the guy some slack ive seen a little of what the three of you can pull off together before he hasnt rip he pulled her close a moment you go running through fire it shakes a man up some yeah okay nothing she thought ever felt quite as solid and steady as her brother ill talk to him why dont you take nell and mia back to the house well be along in a minute you got it she gathered herself picked up one of macs scattered pencils and took it to him im sorry i snapped at you no problem look dont go sulky on me you dont know what its like to no i dont he shot back and you dont know what its like to just stand there fucking stand there when i dont know if youre hurt okay im sorry i couldnt to her horror her voice broke and her vision wavered with tears damn it i told you i was churned up okay whoa he drew her into his arms stroked her hair why dont you just hold on here a minute crying pisses me off i bet just hold on she gave in gave up and wrapped her arms around him ill get it together in a minute thats okay because i want to hold on too i thought you were he saw it again that flash of her face that was white as bone as she leaped into a wall of golden flame i dont know what i thought im prepared for a lot of this kind of thing ive seen magic i believe in it but nothing ive seen or imagined comes close to what the three of you did tonight i didnt want to be here then why were you what scared you enough to bring you here she shook her head i only want to tell it once lets go back to mias he hitched his equipment bag onto his shoulder you were in pain i saw that the circle wasnt prepared for me and i wasnt prepared for it no before that before you did your deathdefying leap you see a hell of a lot dont you for a guy whos always losing his glasses theyre just for reading and close work he wanted to stroke to tend to cuddle and was afraid if he did theyd both fall apart is there any pain now no she sighed no i took the power called my element made the circle of three theres no pain now but youre not happy about it like nell she knew her way through the forest through the dark already she could see the glimmer of light from mias windows it brings nell joy and gives mia a kind of i dont know foundation for nell its an exploration for mia its like breathing and for you for me its a goddamn stampede so you chose to fence it in and i didnt use strong enough nails she finished with just a hint of bitterness and shook her head to ward off any more questions mac supposed the food and wine were another kind of ritual one used as a bridge between the fantastic and the ordinary though he doubted he would forget even the smallest detail about the night he scribbled in his notebook as mia played hostess is it all right to ask questions she smiled at him of course she replied as she curled cozily in a chair but they may or may not be answered what you did tonight your preparations your ceremonial tools and ritualistic well trappings were very simple very basic for such extraordinary results too many trappings and too much ceremony is usually a cloak to disguise a lack of power or used to feed the ego perhaps to impress an audience do you need them at all what an interesting question mac what do you think i think not and even he before tonight wouldnt have believed it i think the gift in each one of you is beyond them i think you could light the fire in your hearth without moving from that chair without casting a circle without ritual she sat back regarding him what was it about him she wondered that tugged at her that made her want to share with him what shed shared with no outsider theres a reason for traditions even for superstition for ceremony it helps focus power and pays respect to the source but of course behind her the fire leaped to life in the hearth youre quite right showoff ripley muttered she laughed and the fire damped down to a soft and pleasant glow youre right too she sipped her wine and her eyes met ripleys over the rim of her glass you used to have more of a sense of humor about it and you used to lecture that i should take more responsibility i suppose i did how tedious of me oh dont start pinching at each other nell ordered you wear me out we could have used her as a mediator years ago mia sipped her wine again we are the three it cant be changed avoided or ignored you know the legend she said to mac very well the one called air left the sanctuary of the island she married a man who couldnt accept her wouldnt cherish her and in the end destroyed her she destroyed herself nell said disagreeing by not believing in who she was by lacking the courage to maybe mac nodded the one called earth refused to accept what had happened it ate through her until she used her power to avenge her sister she wanted justice ripley rose to prowl she needed it her need caused her to break trust mias hand lifted an inch off the chair then lowered again it wasnt time to reach out to turn from everything she was and had been given and use power to harm she couldnt control it ripley said in a shaky voice she couldnt stop it she didnt control or stop it and doomed herself and what she loved and the third ripley spun back she who was fire found a silkie in human form sleeping in a cave near a cove and taking his pelt she hid it and bound him to her its not against the laws of magic to do so in a casual move that cost her a great deal mia leaned over and selected a cube of cheese from a tray she took him as lover as husband raised her children with him then the children of her lost sisters the food tasted like chalk in her throat but she nibbled casually she gave him her heart but the day came when she was less than vigilant and he found his pelt and though he had loved her when a silkie has his pelt the sea beckons he forgot her their life their love their children as though they had never existed and left her for the sea mia lifted a shoulder without sister without lover without husband she pined and pining despaired she cursed her magic for bringing her love then stealing it away and abjuring it leaped from the cliffs to the sea where her lover had gone death isnt the answer nell added i know it was at that moment hers mia stated so three hundred years later the descendants of the sisters of the three must make restitution must turn back each key one by three or the island they made will tumble forever into the sea if you believe that why do you live here ripley demanded why are you in this house why the bookstore why anything this is my place and my time the same as its yours and nells if you dont believe it why are you here tonight mia could feel her temper begin to snap and yanked it back she also saw the misery on ripleys face it was hard after so many years to reach out but she got to her feet held out a hand tell me let me help i saw it was painful like being ripped open head to gut and so fast there was no time to react you know it doesnt have to be that way you know it doesnt ask for pain nor want harm threefold a single tear spilled over before she could stop it what you send comes back times three she destroyed them not alone each of them had responsibility tell me she wiped the tear from ripleys cheek herself what did you see i saw she replayed the vision her voice calming as she spoke i dont know who he was or what he represented but hell come none of you could stop me no more than i could stop myself it was my sword mia my ritual sword i killed him with it and killed us all you wont you wont she repeated before ripley could protest youre stronger than that i wanted to hurt him i could feel the rage ive never had control over power when my emotions take over why the hell do you think i stopped because you were afraid the temper came bubbling back a decade of fury you turned away from me from what you are because you were afraid of what you might do youre just stupid she whirled away then yelped when ripley grabbed her by the hair and yanked who the hell are you calling stupid you skinny snotty selfserving bitch her eyes narrowed when mia lifted a bunched fist then she let out a laugh yeah like that scares me hit me with your thumb tucked in that way youre going to hurt yourself more than me youre such a damn girl mia thats an interesting observation since youre the one doing the hair pulling with a shrug ripley let go okay were even she blew out a breath blinking when she realized that all the other people in the room had gotten to their feet shed forgotten they were there sorry after smoothing her hair mia slid into her chair again pissed you off when i called you stupid didnt i damn right so watch it but you didnt use power to strike at me when my back was turned mia lifted her glass again you didnt even consider it tricky witch ripley thought with reluctant admiration shed always been tricky i wasnt that mad yes you were zack commented and settled down again you really hate being called a coward or stupid she did both and all you did was pull her hair its not the same thing close enough zack took his wifes hand studied his sister there are two things youre not rip youre not a coward and youre not stupid everyone in this room can handle themselves i dont know as much about all this as the rest of you but i know you and its time you stopped thinking everything hinges on you nobodys alone here i couldnt stand to hurt you to be responsible for it i couldnt live with it mom and dad nell answer me this she demanded turning back to mia and no bullshit what if i leave the island if i pack up get on the ferry and just dont come back could it break the chain you already know the answer but why dont we ask mac to give it this is his field as an academic an observer and someone who has done considerable research into such matters your objective opinion dr booke the island itself has power in sort of a holding pattern until its stirred up or applied then if i leave it i take away my what conduit to it can i do that on some level yes but that would only decrease potentially decrease your personal focus of energy it wouldnt change a thing im sorry where you go isnt the point what you do is he could see she wasnt satisfied so he spread his hands and tried to explain his theory okay if for the purposes of this discussion we take legend as fact youll have a choice to make something to do or not to do youre here he used a napkin as the island placed three olives on it then he plucked one olive up and set it on a tray you leave all you do is change the location of the choice the act the restraint wherever you go the four elements exist you cant defy basic natural law what you are doesnt change and what you do carries back by earth air fire water he jabbed a fingertip onto the napkin right back to the source inevitably staying is your only logical choice youre stronger here and the three of you together make the difference hes right nell spoke and brought ripleys attention around weve already changed the pattern once were three when before there were only two left without you and mia without you she said to zack there would only be two now their circle was broken by this point ours isnt but it is rusty mia said and chose another cube of cheese youll need to get back in shape deputy ripley snagged an olive popped it into her mouth the hell i will fourteen how about for tonight you turn those things off ripley stood on the threshold of the yellow cottage she wasnt willing to go in and have a bunch of damn machines start scanning her not after the evening shed had sure mac slipped by her set down his equipment bag then began shutting down he hadnt expected her to come back with him though she didnt look it he imagined she was tired or at the least had had enough of people in general perhaps him in particular shed bounced back that was certain back to trading sharp little barbs with mia to behaving as if what had happened in the clearing had been nothing major it was an unbelievable shield that she hefted he thought nearly as impressive as the one that had kept him out of the circle in the clearing he wondered just how vulnerable she felt when her grip on that shield slipped you want to sit he asked when she stepped inside and shut the door or just go to bed well thats cutting to the chase his color rose i didnt mean sex i thought you might want some sleep she saw now that was exactly what hed meant yeah he was a damn sweetie all right she decided and prowled what she could of the room its a little early to bunk down i thought you had stuff you wanted to talk to me about i do i didnt figure youd be up for it tonight im not tired it doesnt work that way how here let me take your jacket she stepped back before he could and shrugged out of it herself if i know youre thinking the question you might as well ask it how does it work i feel like ive got a tanker load of caffeine in my system energized she continued crossing to him to give him a quick firm shove edgy and another so yeah i want to go to bed the last shove pushed him through the bedroom doorway and nobodys going to sleep okay then why dont we just she shoved him again then slapped on the lights i dont want conversation and i dont want the dark right for some reason he felt as if hed just opened the door to a very hungry shewolf her eyes were different greener sharper predatory his blood began to pump quickly helplessly ill just close these curtains leave them ripley his laugh was a little strangled were pretty isolated but nonetheless with the lights on leave them she yanked her sweater off in one quick move if you like that shirt youd better strip it off and now otherwise its toast you know he let out a breath tried to work up an easy smile youre scaring me good be afraid she leaped at him knocking him back on the bed hunching over him like a sleek cat she made some primitive sound in her throat as she bared her teeth then set them on his neck christ he went hard as rock i want it fast she panted tearing open his shirt and rough and now he reached for her but she fisted her hands in his hair yanked then ravished his mouth the sheer heat of her seared through him scorching the nerves stealing the breath boiling the blood he spiraled down into the dark where pain and pleasure were twins equally vital equally irresistible in response the animal inside him lunged straining at the end of its tether snapping it his body reared up beneath hers and his hands were hard and bruising as they tore and took he yanked her hair dragging her head back to expose her throat for his teeth it wasnt desperation that filled him but appetite they rolled over the bed fighting for more flesh more heat she was alive with need and all of it feral energy pumped through her and all of it savage her nails raked at him her teeth nipped and when his fingers drove into her her cry was one of fierce and greedy triumph higher was all she could think faster she wanted peak after violent peak lights danced in her mind a blinding silver shower and the storm that fueled them fueled her she slithered over him like a snake straddled him and filled herself it was like being consumed devoured whole she closed over him like a fist trapping him in hot wet heat holding him there by the power of her own climax staggered he watched it rip through her watched her body pearled with sweat bow back and shudder shudder and she began to move lightning fast her hair fell forward a tangle of dense brown as she leaned down chewed restlessly on his bottom lip he pistoned himself into her hard fast strokes while his hands gripped her hips like a vise then she leaned back rode him ruthlessly to the barbed edge of peak not yet not yet she panted even as his vision blurred as his system strained toward that blessed release she lifted her arms above her head as she had done when shed called her power he felt the shock of it like a redtipped arrow through the haze of mad pleasure clean sharp and stunning as it pierced through her and into him he lay like a dead man but it didnt seem to matter dying for such an experience didnt seem too high a price to pay right at the moment he felt as though hed been hulled out every care every worry every spare thought carved away to be replaced by pure sensation he might not be able to walk or speak or think again but those were minor inconveniences he was going to pass out of this world a very happy man ripley made a little purring sound aha he thought vaguely he could still hear that was a nice bonus then her mouth closed over his his body could still register sensation better and better mac he opened his mouth some sound came out it wasnt words but there were a great many forms of verbal communication hed make do mac she said again and slid her hand down his body closed her fingers over him oh yeah he was definitely able to feel sensation uhhuh he cleared his throat managed to open one eye he wasnt blind after all another plus yeah i wasnt asleep his voice was rusty but there and he realized his throat was desperate with thirst i was having a neardeath experience it wasnt bad now that youre back from beyond she slithered up his body again and rendered him speechless when he saw she still had that gleam in her eye again hey well he had some trouble breathing when her lips trailed down his chest youre going to have to give me a little time to recover you know maybe a month she laughed and the wicked sound of it rippled over his skin in that case youre just going to have to lie there and take it her mouth kept going he melted into the bed well if i have to i have to ripley knew she was in trouble shed never shared power with a man before never felt the need or desire to do so with mac it had been a kind of compulsion a deep drowning need to extend that intimacy link that part of her with him there was no longer any doubt that she was in love with him or any hope that she could rationalize it away traditionally todds waited a long time to fall in love and when they did it came hard and fast and it was forever it looked as if she was upholding the family name but she didnt have a clue what to do about it right at the moment she couldnt seem to care as for mac he felt slightly drunk and saw no reason to fight the sensation the wind had started to rise the sound of it shivering against the windows only made the cottage cozier it was as if they were the only two people on the island as far as he was concerned it could stay that way what was that stuff you wanted to tell me hmm he continued to play with her hair and thought he could happily stay under those tangled sheets with her for the rest of his life it can wait why im here youre here im thirsty she sat up scooped her hair back didnt you say something about wine probably you sure youre up for wine and conversation she angled her head its that or youll have to get up for something else as lowering as it was to admit it he was certain if she jumped him again he would never live through it ill get the wine she laughed as he rolled out of bed here he pulled open a drawer tossed her some sweats might as well be comfortable thanks got any food depends on your definition just some munchies ive got a craving tell me about it ive got potato chips thatll do she tugged on the sweatpants adjusting the drawstring until she was reasonably sure theyd stay up ill dig them out when he was gone she pulled on the sweatshirt and indulged herself by sniffing at the sleeves exploring the sensation of wearing something that was his it was foolish and female she admitted but nobody had to know about it but her when she walked into the kitchen he already had the wine open two glasses out and a bag of chips on the counter she snagged the chips plopped down in a chair and prepared to gorge lets not ah do this in here mac began nerves pricked at his bubble of contentment he had no idea how she would react to what he had to tell her that was just one of her fascinations for him her unpredictability why and there was another he thought she asked why nearly as often as he did himself because well be more comfortable in the other room the living room well sit on your equipment haha no theres the couch its still in there and we can get a fire going are your feet cold want some socks no im fine but he wasnt she noted something was making him jumpy she pondered it as she followed him back into the living room since they had to squeeze their way through to get to the sofa she doubted hed used it for its intended purpose since hed taken over the cottage he put the wine on the floor then began to move stacks of books off the cushions and set them aside she opened her mouth to protest the trouble then shut it again with an almost audible snap wine conversation a cozy fire romantic just the sort of romantic setup she imagined a man might want when he told a woman he loved her her heart began to beat thickly is this an important conversation she asked him through lips that felt trembly and soft i think so he hunkered down in front of the hearth im a little nervous about it i didnt expect to be im not sure how to start youll figure it out her legs wobbled a little so she sat down he set logs kindling then glanced back at her it took her a minute to clue in to his speculative look what she thought of as his scientist look yes i could start it from here she told him but i wont just wondering ah lore holds that making fire is the basic form of magic usually the first learned and the last lost would that be accurate i guess if youre talking about a tangible form one that requires direction focus control because she felt hot and itchy she shifted mias better than i am at explaining that sort of thing i dont havent been thinking about it for a long time she never stops thats probably why the control and philosophy come more naturally to her he struck a long wooden match set it against the starter your powers more i dont know explosive while hers is more centered he got to his feet as the flames began to lick rubbed his hands on the hips of his jeans im trying to think how to approach what i want to tell you a flock of sparrows divebombed in her stomach you could just say it i work better with a buildup he bent down to pour the wine i had it pretty well set in my head before tonight but first seeing you understanding to some extent what you went through what you feel then being with you ripley he sat beside her handed her the wine then touched the back of her hand i want you to know that its never been like it is with you not with anyone else there were tears in her throat and for the first time in her life she found the taste of them lovely its different for me he nodded felt a little hitch in his heart as he took that to mean she experienced intimacy differently because of what she was all right well what im trying to say here is that because of whats he dragged a hand through his hair because you matter because whats between us matters to me the rest of it is a little more complicated i guess im concerned that especially after i get into the rest you might think you matter to me only because of my work thats not true ripley you just matter everything smoothed out inside her like silk brushed with a loving hand i dont think that i wouldnt still be here if i did i wouldnt want to be here and i do he took her hand and kissing her palm sent a long slow ripple sliding from her toes to her throat mac she whispered originally i was going to tell mia first but i want to tell you i you mia theoretically shes the main connection but its all linked anyway plus i realized i needed to tell you first he kissed her hand again somewhat absently this time then sipped his wine like a man wetting his throat before preparing to lecture her lovely mood went ragged at the edges i really think youd better spit it out mac okay each one of the sisters had children some stayed on the island others left never to return and others traveled married then came back to the island to raise their families i imagine you know all that and that their children did the same and so on down the generations as a result some of their descendants have always remained on three sisters but others scattered over the world i dont know what youre getting at id probably be better off showing you hold on a minute she watched him get up then wind his way through the equipment hearing him curse lightly when he stubbed his toe gave her small but vicious satisfaction the son of a bitch she thought rapping her fisted hand on the cushion he wasnt about to pledge his undying love to pour out his heart to beg her to marry him hed circled right back around to his stupid research while shed been sitting there starryeyed and whose fault is that she reminded herself she was the one whod gotten it all twisted up she was the one whod left herself open for the clip on the jaw she was the stupid one the one whod gone all mushy with love and stopped thinking clearly she would just have to fix that not the love she was a todd and accepted that she loved him and always would but she certainly could get her head on straight again and start thinking he was the one meant for her so he was going to have to deal with it dr macallister booke wasnt just going to study witches he was damn well going to marry one as soon as she figured out how to make him sorry he skirted the equipment more carefully this time it wasnt where i thought i put it nothing ever is his expression changed with the glittering look she sent him ah something wrong no not a thing playfully she patted the cushion beside her i was just thinking its a waste to sit alone in front of the fire when he sat she slid her leg intimately over his much better well his blood pressure began a steady rise as she leaned in and rubbed her lips over his jaw i thought youd want to read this mmm why dont you read it to me she nibbled lightly on his earlobe you have such a sexy voice she took the glasses out of his pocket and you know how turned on i get when you wear these he made some sound then fumbled the glasses on these are ah photocopied pages i have the original journal in a vault because its old and fragile it was written by my great well a number of greats grandmother on my mothers side the first entry was made september and written on three sisters island ripley jerked back what did you say i think you should just listen today he read my youngest child had a child they have named him sebastian and he is hale and healthy i am grateful hester and her fine young man are content to remain on the island to make their home and family here my other children are so far away now and though from time to time i look into the glass to see them my heart aches that i am unable to touch their faces or the faces of my grandchildren i will never leave the island again this also i have seen in the glass i have time yet on this earth and i know death is not an end but when i see this beauty of life in this babe of my babe i am saddened that i will not be here to see him grown he risked a quick glance at ripley saw she was staring at him as if shed never seen him before best to finish it all he told himself just get it all out at one time i am saddened that my own mother did not choose life he continued that she denied herself the joy i have felt this day on seeing a child come from one of my own time moves swiftly what comes from this boy will one day balance the scales if our children remember and choose wisely though shed forgotten she held it ripleys knuckles were white on the stem of her glass where did you get this last summer i was going through some boxes in the attic of my parents house i found the journal id been through those boxes before i used to drive my mother crazy because i was always pawing through the old stuff i dont know how i missed it unless you subscribe to the theory that it wasnt there for me until last june june when a shudder worked through her ripley got to her feet nell had come to the island in june and the three had linked she sensed that mac started to speak and she held up a hand she needed to focus youre assuming this was written by an ancestor not assuming ive done the genealogy ripley her name was constance and her youngest daughter hester married james macallister on may their first child a son sebastian edward macallister was born on three sisters island he fought in the revolutionary war married had children settled in new york the line runs down through my mother and into me youre telling me youre a descendant of i have all the documentation marriage records birth records you could say were really distant cousins she stared at him then turned to stare into the fire why didnt you tell us when you first came here okay thats a little sticky he wished she would sit back down cuddle up against him again but he didnt think that was going to happen until they got through this i thought i might have to use it as an incentive a kind of bargaining chip your ace in the hole she remarked yeah if mia put up roadblocks i figured this information would be a good way to knock some of them down but she didnt and i started to feel uncomfortable about withholding it i was going to tell her tonight but i needed to tell you first why because you matter i realize youre ticked off but she shook her head not really unsettled she thought but not angry idve done the same thing to get what i wanted i didnt know youd be here you know what i mean you i didnt know wed be involved like this im in what most people consider an illogical field its only more essential to approach it logically but under it on a personal level ive been pulled to this place all my life without knowing where it was that i was being pulled last summer i finally knew but you didnt come i had to gather data research analyze factcheck always the geek she sat on the arm of the couch it was he thought a step i guess i dreamed of the island before i knew where it was or if it was i dreamed of it i dreamed of you all of that was so strong so much a part of my life that i needed to approach it the way id been trained as an observer a recorder and what do your observations tell you dr booke ive got reams of data but i dont think youd be interested in reading it she shook her head at his questioning look right but ive also got one simple feeling that im where im supposed to be i have a part in this i just dont know yet exactly what it is she was up again a part in what balancing the scales do you believe in that detailfiling brain of yours that this island is doomed to fall into the sea how can you buy some centuriesold curse islands dont just sink like swamped boats there are a number of respected scholars and historians who would argue that point using atlantis as their example of which you would be one she said sourly yeah but before you get me started on that and i bore you senseless let me just say that theres always room for lessthanliteral interpretations a force five hurricane an earthquake earthquake shed felt the earth tremble under her feet shed made the earth tremble and didnt want to think of it jesus mac you dont want me to start on plates and pressure and shifts do you she opened her mouth shut it again and settled for shaking her head didnt think so ive got degrees in geology and meteorology and i can get really boring anyway put simply natures a bitch and she barely tolerates us she studied him consideringly earnest sexy quiet somehow unshakably confident hardly a wonder that shed fallen for him you know what i bet youre not as boring when you get going as you think youd lose because he thought she would accept it now he reached out to take her hand heaven and earth ripley do more than hold us between them they expect us to deserve it and we have to decide how far well go that pretty much wraps it up she puffed out her cheeks blew out a breath it gets harder to tell myself this is all crap first nell then you and now this she added glancing down at the copies of journal pages it starts to feel like somebodys added bars to a cage so theres less and less chance of squeezing out again she frowned down at the pages as another thought sprang into her head youve got a blood connection to the sisters her gaze flashed up to his do you have magic no seems like a ripoff to me he said i may have inherited the interest the fascination but none of the practical usage she relaxed and slid down on the seat beside him well thats something at least fifteen mia read the first journal entry while sitting at her desk in her office a freezing rain had come in behind the wind and was now battering her window shed dressed in bright bold blue to dispel the gloom and wore the little stars and moons nell had given her for her last birthday at her ears as she read she toyed with them sending star colliding with moon when shed finished the entry she leaned back and studied mac with amusement well hello cousin i wasnt sure how youd take it i try to take things as they come may i keep these a while id like to read the rest of them sure she set the pages aside picked up her latté its all so nice and tidy isnt it i realize its quite a coincidence he began but she stopped him coincidence is often what tidies things up i can trace my family back to its start on the sisters i know some stayed some scattered and i remember now there was a macallister branch the one son among three daughters he left the island survived a war and began to make his fortune odd isnt it that i didnt think of that until now or connect it with you i suppose i wasnt meant to still i felt something for you a kinship thats nice and tidy too and comforting comfort wasnt my first reaction when i put it all together what was excitement descended from a witch and a silkie how cool is that he broke off a piece of the applesauce muffin shed urged on him then i was pretty irked that i didnt get any power out of the deal youre wrong the affection and admiration in her voice nearly made him flush your mind is your power the strength and the openness of that mind make very strong magic stronger yet because it doesnt close off your heart well need both she waited a beat shell need you it gave him a jolt mia had said it so quietly so simply do me a favor and dont mention that to ripley itll just piss her off you understand her recognize all of her various flaws numerous shortcomings and irritating habits but you love her anyway yes i he trailed off set the muffin aside that was very sneaky id apologize but i wouldnt mean it her laughter was too warm and soft to sting i thought you were in love with her but i wanted to hear you say it can you be happy living on the island he said nothing for a moment you really know her dont you ripley would never be happy anywhere else so yes i can be happy here ive been heading here all my life in any case i like you very much enough to wish just a little that it had been me you were meant for and you she added when he looked slightly panicked whod been meant for me since neither of those things is im glad we can be friends i think youll help each other find the best you can be you really love her dont you for an instant mias calm ruffled color washed her cheeks a rare occurrence then she shrugged yes nearly as much as im irritated by her now i trust youll keep that to yourself as i keep your feelings to myself deal and to seal it she rose and turned to the shelves behind her she took down a carved wooden box and opening it removed a starshaped pendant of silver set with a sunstone this has been in my family our family she corrected since we began here on the sisters its said that she who was mine forged the pendant from a fallen star and the stone from a sunbeam ive kept it for you mia but she only kissed him lightly and slipped the chain over his head blessed be cousin harding paid one more visit to evan remington his plans were set his schedule outlined but he felt it imperative to see remington again before he left he felt an odd kinship with the man the realization of it was both appalling and alluring to him remington was a kind of monster and yet didnt all men have that beast lurking inside them the sane the civilized and harding considered himself both restrained it controlled it he supposed it only made those who did neither who indulged it kept it fed and ready more fascinating he told himself that his regular visits to remington were research business but in truth he had come to find those frequent brushes with evil thrilling we were all one step away from the pit harding thought composing notes in his head as he waited to be admitted only by observing by learning from those who had fallen would we understand what waited for us on the other side of sanity harding stepped into the visitation room heard the echo of the lock is that the last sound we hear as we fall he wrote in his head the hopeless shooting of the bolt remington wasnt restrained this time harding had already been told that as part of his treatment and rehabilitation remington had been taken off full restraints hed exhibited no violence to others or himself and had been responsive and cooperative in recent sessions the room was small and nearly empty one table with two chairs while the restraints were missing harding heard the bright jingle of chain from the cuff on remingtons right wrist there was a third chair in the corner occupied now by a broadshouldered pastyfaced guard security cameras recorded every sound and movement the pit harding thought whatever name we gave it offered no privacy and little comfort mr remington evan today you could hardly see the madness after all this we can hardly be formal ill call you jonathan do you know jonathan youre the only one who comes to talk to me they tell me my sisters been here but i dont remember i remember you the voice was quiet but perfectly clear harding experienced a small inward shudder as he remembered just how remington had looked and sounded on his first visit he was still thin and too pale his hair lank but harding thought if you put him back in a designer suit and shipped him off to la his associates would take a look and simply think hed been working a bit too hard youre looking well evan hardly my best but one must take the facilities into account a muscle twitched in his cheek i dont belong here my attorneys bungled the entire business but ive taken care of that dealt with that stupid incompetent bastards ive fired them i expect to have new representation within the week and my freedom shortly after i see i think you do remington leaned forward then he gazed up toward the security cameras i think you do see i was defending myself and mine his eyes stayed on hardings now and something dark seemed to swim behind their colorless surface i was betrayed and misused those who stood against me they belong in here not i harding couldnt look away couldnt break the connection your exwife my wife remington corrected then in barely a whisper mouthed till death do us part tell her im thinking of her when you see her wont you i beg your pardon you cant finish what youve started you cant get what you want until you deal with her and the rest of them ive thought about it remington nodded slowly and his eyes pale as water stayed locked on hardings i have plenty of time for thinking i need someone to remind her i havent forgotten i need someone to show them all that i cant be ignored an agent if you will mr remington evan im a reporter a writer i know what you are i know what you want fame fortune recognition respect i know how to get those things for you i made it my business to get those things for others you want to be a star jonathan i make stars something seemed to move behind his eyes again like sharks swimming in a deep pool harding shuddered but couldnt look away and as his skin crawled cold he could feel himself being pulled in his breath came short beneath a terrible pressure in his chest im going to write a book yes yes an important book youll tell it as its meant to be told end it as it needs to be ended i want them punished he reached over with his free hand clasped hardings limp fingers i want them dead something snapped in the air sizzled and brought the guard to his feet no contact thou shalt not suffer a witch to live harding said dully as a fierce grin flashed on remingtons face no physical contact the guard ordered and strode toward the table but remington was already breaking his grip im sorry remington kept his gaze averted his head lowered i forgot i just wanted to shake his hand he comes to visit me he comes to talk to me we were just saying goodbye to his own ears hardings voice sounded tinny with distance i have to take a trip and wont be able to visit for a while i have to go now harding got unsteadily to his feet a headache blasted in his temples remington lifted his gaze one last time ill see you again yes of course remington allowed himself to be led away he kept his head lowered shuffled obligingly back to his cell in his heart black glee bloomed like a fetid flower for he had discovered that there was power in madness by the time harding was on the ferry for three sisters he could barely remember his last visit to remington it irritated him made him worry that he was coming down with something his memory for details was one of his most polished skills and now an event less than eight hours old was like some sketchy scene behind foggy glass he couldnt remember what theyd spoken of only that hed been suddenly struck with a blinding headache it had made him so ill hed been forced to stretch out on the front seat of his car and wait for the chills the pain the nausea to pass before hed dared drive away even now just thinking of it gave him the shakes his condition wasnt helped by the fact that the seas were rough and a needlesharp icy rain was pounding he had to huddle inside his car dryswallow more seasickness pills he was terrified that he would have to race through that vicious rain and vomit into the pitching sea in defense he once more lay down across the seat fighting to breathe slowly and evenly he began to count the minutes until he reached solid land again and must have fallen asleep he dreamed of snakes sliding under his skin the slither of them ice cold of a woman with blue eyes and long gold hair who cried out all pain and pleas as he brought a cane down again and again to batter her shes quiet now quiet now spawn of satan of a bolt of blue lightning that shot like an arrow out of the sky and into his heart he dreamed of terror and vengeance and hate he dreamed of a lovely woman in a white dress who wept as she curled on a marble floor of a wood dark under a new moon where he stood holding a knife to a smooth white throat and this time when it sliced clean and her blood covered him the world erupted the sky split and the sea opened its mouth wide to swallow all who had stood against him he awoke with screams strangling in his throat slapping at himself as if to kill whatever was crawling inside him for an instant he stared horrified in the rearview mirror and eyes that werent his eyes pale as water stared back then the ferry let out its blasting note to herald the docking on three sisters the eyes that stared back at him as he dragged out his handkerchief to wipe his damp face were redrimmed haunted and his own just caught a little bug he assured himself hed been working too hard traveling too much crossing time zones too often he would take a day or two to rest to let his system catch up bolstered by the idea he snapped on his seat belt started his car and drove off the ferry ramp and onto three sisters island the storm turned into a gale on the second day of it mac surfaced from his work and took a good look around hed had another shipment of books sent in and replacement parts for some of his equipment right now he had pieces of a sensor spread all over the little kitchen table a monitor that was acting up stood on the counter with its guts spilling out the kitchen still smelled of the eggs hed burned that morning which he had to admit hed had no business making when his mind was elsewhere hed broken a glass too and had a nice slice in his heel since hed gotten distracted before he swept it all up hed turned the entire cottage into a lab which wasnt so bad but without a lab assistant cleaning things up behind him hed also turned it into a disaster he really didnt mind working in a disaster area but it certainly wouldnt do as a permanent living arrangement if the cottage was too small to accommodate him and his work on more than the short term it was certainly too small to accommodate a ripley he thought quickly he wasnt quite ready to use the term wife even in his thoughts not that he didnt want to marry her because he did and not because he doubted she would marry him he would just wait her out in that area until she caved hed match his patience against her stubbornness any day of the week but first things first when a man wanted to settle down permanently he had to find a place to settle however much affection he had for the cottage it wouldnt fill the bill and he doubted seriously if mia would sell it he rose and managed not only to tread on a screw but to step on it at the exact point of his recent cut he spent a little time on some inventive cursing and hobbled out to find the shoes hed thought hed already put on he found a pair in the bedroom doorway where they had obviously planted themselves cagily waiting for him to trip over them and holding them took a look at the bedroom winced he didnt usually live like a slob okay he admitted he didnt usually intend to live like a slob it just happened forgetting the shoes he pushed up his sleeves he would shovel out the bedroom and use the manual labor to clear his mind he needed to think about a house it needed to be a pretty good size so his equipment didnt get in everybodys way he would need an office too not entirely sure when he might have changed his sheets last he decided to err on the side of caution and stripped them off it would be good if there was space to set up weights and exercise equipment ripley would want some space of her own too he imagined and started gathering up socks shirts underwear somewhere she could get away from him when he started to drive her crazy his mother called hers an escape hatch he remembered and reminded himself to phone home he carted the laundry to the tiny room off the kitchen missed stepping on the same screw by a hair and stuffed everything that would fit into the washing machine he added soap then deciding he should write down some of the basic house requirements wandered out to find a pad and forgot to turn on the washing machine three bedrooms minimum he thought four would be better someplace close to the water not that anywhere on the island was far from it but ripley was used to living right on the beach so booke you idiot its staring you right in the face you knew the first time you saw it he dashed to the phone and dialed long distance information new york city he told the operator i need the number for logan enterprises an hour later to celebrate what he considered the first step in becoming a homeowner he braved the elements thaddeus logan hadnt jumped at the offer but he hadnt dismissed it out of hand either it hadnt hurt that logan was acquainted with macs father connections within connections mac thought as he hissed in his breath and decided to walk to café book rather than risk the icedover roads in his rover he had a good feeling about it and he was certain logan would negotiate which reminded mac he should call his father for advice in that area the one thing he was sure of was if you wanted something too much and the other party knew it you were asking to get skinned he needed to do some research on real estate values in the area and he patted his pockets absently hoping for a handy piece of paper to make a note to himself not that the money mattered all that much but the principle did and he imagined that if he let himself get taken ripley would get torqued about it that would start the whole process off on a bad note tomorrow mac promised himself he would take a drive and get another good look at what was going to be theirs delighted with the idea he strolled along head down as the wind screamed in his ears and the ugly mix of ice and snow swirled and spat just look at him ripley thought out in this mess when he doesnt have to be not looking where hes going and bopping along as if its a sunny day in july the man needs a keeper she would just have to take on the job she started toward him then judging time and distance planted herself and let him walk straight into her jeez since she was braced and he wasnt he went skidding reflexively he grabbed her and that took them both on a fast slide sorry but she was laughing and the little elbow jab she gave him was friendly how many walls do you walk into on your average day i dont count its demoralizing gosh youre pretty he grabbed her again but was steady this time lifting her to her toes he planted a long warm kiss on her mouth her system tilted sweetly what i am is cold and wet my nose is red and my toes are ice cubes zack and i just spent a miserable hour out on the coast road weve got power lines down and cars off the road and the best part of a tree through ed sutters workshop roof nice work if you can get it very funny i think the worst of itll blow out by tomorrow she said looking as islanders had for centuries out to sea and sky both were gray as pewter but were going to be cleaning up after this one for a while yet what the hell are you doing out here you lose power it was on when i left i wanted some decent coffee he clued in to the direction from which shed come and the direction shed been going were you coming to check on me its my job to check on the residents of our happy little rock thats really considerate of you deputy todd how about i buy you a cup of coffee i could use it and someplace warm and dry for ten minutes he took her hand as they headed into the wind up high street how about if i buy a quart of soup and whatever take it home we can have dinner at my place later chances of the power lasting in the cottage through the night are slim weve got a generator at our place why dont you pack what you need and plan on staying there tonight is nell cooking is grass green im there he pulled open the door for her like magic lulu popped out from behind a bookshelf i shouldve known it was a couple of lunatics sensible people are home whining about the weather why arent you ripley asked because there are just enough lunatics on this island to keep the store open got a few of them up in the café right now thats where were heading did nell go home not yet mia cut her loose but shes sticking didnt see why peg should have to come out in this when she was already here were closing early in an hour anyhow good to know ripley pulled off her soaked cap as she started up the stairs do me a favor she said to mac sure can you hang around till closing make sure nell gets home safe glad to thanks itll be a load off i can let zack know and he wont worry ill ask her to come by my place help me get my stuff together ripley shot him a smirk pretty smart arent you people are always saying so he kept her hand in his as they walked to the café counter zack just called nell told them youve had a hell of a day havent you goes with the territory you can give me two large coffees to go and ill take one back to him this guys springing for them she added jerking a thumb at mac a large for me too but ill have it here and is that apple pie it is want a slice warm oh yeah ripley leaned on the counter idly scanning the café i better tell you i invited macs appetite to dinner and to bunk over were having chicken pot pie macs face lit up homemade chicken pot pie nell laughed as she fit tops on the takeout cups youre too easy ripley shifted her body away from the table area whos the guy sitting by himself she asked nell brown sweater city boots i dont know its the first time hes been in i got the impression he was staying at the hotel he came in about a half hour ago did you chat him up nell cut a generous slab of pie for mac i spoke with him in a friendly manner he came in on the ferry a couple of days ago just beat the noreaster people do come here ripley its just an odd time for a slicker to head over no business groups at the hotel now anyway she took the cups nell set on the counter thanks see you later she said to mac and might have warded off the kiss if her hands hadnt been full be careful out there he yanked her cap out of her pocket and tugged it onto her head harding watched the byplay from behind the newspaper hed brought over from the hotel hed recognized ripley todd from his files just as hed recognized nell it didnt explain his reaction to both hed expected to feel a nice zing of anticipation as he lined up the players on the stage instead in each case hed felt nearly ill a kind of whitehot fury had pumped through him when hed topped the steps and seen nell back at the café counter hed been forced to turn away to walk behind bookshelves until he had himself under control there hed sweated like a pig and had imagined his hands closing around her throat the violence of the experience had nearly caused him to turn around and leave but it had passed almost as swiftly as it had come and hed remembered his purpose the story the book fame and fortune hed been able to approach the counter to order lunch with his usual calm he wanted a day or two to observe her and the others before he attempted to interview them hed already lost some time for the first twentyfour hours on the island whatever bug hed picked up had plagued him he had been able to do little more than lie in bed sweating his way through vivid and unpleasant dreams but hed felt better by that afternoon nearly himself again he was still shaky harding told himself there was no doubt about that but a little food and a little exercise would help right him the soup had certainly soothed his system at least until the brunette had walked in then the clamminess had come back the headache the unexplained rage he had the strangest image of her pointing a gun at him shouting at him and hed wanted to leap up and pummel her face with his fists then another fast on its heels where she loomed over him in a storm her hair blowing and tipped with light and a sword that gleamed like silver gripped in her hands he thanked god she was leaving and that the strange mood was leaving with her still his hand trembled as he picked up his spoon again ripley brought zack his coffee and sipped her own while he finished a phone call as she paced she heard him reassuring someone about the storm emergency procedures medical aid had to be a new resident ripley thought probably the carters whod moved onisland in september there was no one else new enough to the sisters to panic over a midwinter storm justine carter zack confirmed when he hung up storms making her buggy shell get used to it or head back to the mainland before next winter listen i told mac to come to our place tonight powers bound to go good idea and i asked him to hang at the bookstore until nell leaves to make sure she gets home okay and an even better one thanks whats up maybe the storms making me buggy i got an itch over this guy i saw at the café cant pin it down city new boots manicure upperenddepartmentstore clothes late forties strong build but he looked a little sickly to me pale sweaty flu runs around this time of year yeah well i thought id go by the hotel see if i can wheedle some information on him because he trusted ripleys instincts zack pointed to the phone call them and save yourself another trip out in this mess no ill get more in person he gave me the jitters zack she admitted the guy was just sitting there reading his paper and eating his lunch but he gave me the jitters i want to check it out okay let me know sixteen procedures taken in planned steps after calculations and hypotheses the tools of his work science even that still considered out of the mainstream these were all familiar to him they were had always been to mac a kind of comfort as well as a path to discovery for the first time since hed started on that path he was uneasy hed never worried overmuch about taking risks as nothing worthwhile could be gained without them but each step he took now pushed him farther down a strange and fascinating road one he wasnt traveling solo are you sure you want to do this nell shifted her gaze up to where mac leaned over the top of her head im sure its just that i dont want you to feel obliged he attached the next electrode dont think you have to be polite to the crazy man you can just tell me to forget it mac i dont think youre crazy and i dont feel polite i feel interested thats good he skirted around the sofa where she was stretched out looked down at her as hed told her once before she sparkled she was also he sensed very open im going to be careful im going to go slow but anytime you want to stop you just say so and thats it got it and i will her dimples fluttered stop worrying about me its not just you at her questioning look he dragged a hand through his hair everything i do now even somehow what i dont do affects ripley i dont know how i know that its not really logical but i know it youre connected nell said softly as i am neither of us will do anything to hurt her she touched a hand to the back of his but both of us will more than likely do things that will annoy her i guess well just have to handle it i guess we will okay well he gestured vaguely with the two electrodes in his hands i need to put these you see well need to monitor your heart rate so she looked at the little white adhesive back up at his face ah if you feel uncomfortable or weird about that well just skip that part she studied his expression and decided the only man she trusted more than the one currently trying not to look embarrassed was her husband in for a penny she said and unbuttoned her blouse he was quick efficient and gentle just relax and be comfortable well get your resting rates he turned away from her to work with the machines that hed hauled over from the cottage he hadnt intended to bring them or to do the test not yet but when nell had come back to the cottage with him shed asked questions polite interest at first he thought then more direct more detailed before either of them realized it they were discussing physical reactions of magic brainwave patterns lobes pulse rates and she was agreeing to participate in a series of tests so whered you learn to cook my mother thats where my interest started after we lost my father she started her own catering business he adjusted dials watched the graph ever think about opening a restaurant i gave it a passing thought but i dont want the structure or the limitations i like my catering operation and working in mias café though i am toying with ideas there i think we she nell corrected could expand a bit outdoor seating in the season maybe a cooking club im going to talk to her about it when i have it more formulated in my mind youve got a head for business oh absolutely and she said it with no small sense of pride i ran that end of my mothers operation i like to organize and create you create with your cooking she dimpled again with sheer pleasure thats a nice thing to say its a gift like your power is a gift her vital signs were steady and stable he checked the readout on the ekg made some quick notes on his laptop i wonder when you knew you were gifted it seems to me mia was born knowing she was weve talked about it and ripley she doesnt talk about it as much but i think it was almost the same a knowing always and a burden he wondered always for you a discovery and a learning process i had dreams when i was a child of this place of people id yet to meet but i never thought of them as i dont know memories or foretelling then after evan her hands tensed deliberately relaxed again i forgot them or blocked them when i left my only clear thought was to run to get away but the dreams started coming back did they frighten you no not at all they were a comfort at first then a kind of need one day i saw a painting the lighthouse the cliffs mias home and i needed to be there it was a a destination do you know what its like to find out where it is you finally need to be he thought of the house near the cove yes i do exactly then you know its not just a relief but a thrill i drove onto the ferry that day in june and when i caught my first glimpse of the sisters i thought there finally i could belong there you recognized it part of me did another part just yearned then i met mia and everything began he continued to monitor her one part of his brain ruthlessly calculating changes peaks dips would you say she tutored you yes though she would say she just reminded me nell turned her head so she could look at mac how cool he looks she realized cool and controlled and yet his voice was warm friendly the first time she helped me try magic i stirred the air how did it feel amazing exciting and somehow familiar could you do it now now if youre comfortable with it nothing major i dont want you to spin your furniture around a little ripple for my readings youre such an interesting man mac excuse me just a little ripple for your readings she said with a chuckle no wonder ripleys crazy about you what here then a little ripple in the air just a stir from here to there a quiet breeze this man to please even before it began the readings popped like a gathering mac thought noting the rise of heart rate the fluctuation in brainwave patterns then they jumped again as the air well rippled fabulous look at this pattern i knew it its not just an increase in brain activity its like an expansion almost fully right brain creativity imagination really neat nell chuckled again and stilled the air not so cool now dr booke is it what you were looking for it goes a long way toward confirming some of my theories could you do something else something more complicated not that what you just did was small potatoes he added quickly something that requires more effort more of a punch there you go let me think her lips bowed up as she considered because she wanted him to be surprised she did the chant in her head a call to the senses that was both sweet and stunning this time the gathering came faster and bigger the needle on the ekg graph whipped in wide rapid sweeps suddenly the room was alive with music harps pipes flutes it was drenched in a rainbow of colors and tender with the scent of spring he could barely keep up with the changes desperate to be certain that he had it all on record he checked his camera his monitors nearly danced around the ekg you like it nell asked playfully its fucking great sorry beg your pardon can you just keep it going another minute he asked as he checked his energy sensor its really pretty by the way im eager for spring me too after the last two days respirations up but not that much pulse strong steady physical exertion appears to be minimal hmm heart rates actually back at rest did the use of power calm her or the result the result nell answered he blinked and focused on her again what you were talking to yourself but i think i know the answer she laughed lightly when she saw diego prance into the room to bat playfully at her rainbows its a soothing spell it relaxes me yeah interested he sat down on the floor beside her while harp strings wept would you say your physical reactions reflect the nature of the spell or charm exactly so for example the other night in the clearing it was more powerful maybe edgier because of what you were doing and the fact that the three of you were together its always stronger with the three of us i feel like i could move mountains afterward i stay energized for hours he remembered just how ripley had channeled her energy and cleared his throat okay how are you able to sustain this spell while im distracting you with conversation she looked completely blank for a moment i never thought about it that was clever of you i didnt know you were distracting me let me think its just there she suggested no thats not completely accurate its more like the way youre able to do two different things at one time like patting your head and rubbing your stomach no she responded more like cooking a roast and setting the table you can keep your mind on the one so you dont burn it and still manage the other easily enough whats nine times six fiftyfour oh i see leftbrain function im good with numbers recite the alphabet backward concentrating she began twice she fumbled backtracked hesitated but the music and color never faltered are you ticklish suspicion flickered over her face why i want to try a physical distraction he squeezed a hand on her knee made her yelp and jolt just as ripley and zack came through the door what the hell is going on hearing ripleys voice made mac wince and curse himself for not paying attention to the time then realizing he still had his hand on nells knee and her husband was armed he quickly removed it um from the looks of it zack said with a wink at nell this guys making time with my wife as lucy had come into the house with him he leaned down casually to rub her head as she sniffed the air and batted her tail i guess i have to take him outside and kick his ass get in line ripley said and reminded mac that she was armed as well i ah nell agreed to participate in a couple of tests he began thats not quite true nell corrected and succeeded in making all the blood drain out of macs face his sudden stricken look made her whoop with laughter i volunteered to participate would you mind turning off the entertainment portion of your little program ripley said coolly all right nell closed the spell and there was a moment of complete silence so zack began to strip off his coat whats for dinner you can help me with that nell spoke brightly as soon as im unhooked from these things oh sorry let me mac started to reach for the electrodes monitoring her heart rate then pulled his hands back as if hed burned them nobodys going to shoot me in the back are they he asked nell i can promise zack wont he was just teasing you hes not who im worried about as delicately as possible he unhooked her and kept his gaze discreetly averted as she buttoned her blouse again that was fun nell said as she got up and informative zack why dont you give me a hand in the kitchen now all right all right i hate missing the fun he complained as she dragged him off okay booke why dont you try explaining to me why i shouldnt start swinging because violence is never a sensible solution her answer to that was a low dangerous growl he stopped shutting down his equipment and turned to her okay i figure youre ticked off on a couple of levels so ill pick one to start there was no funny business going on between me and nell it was completely professional son if i thought otherwise youd be braying like a jackass right he took his glasses off to see her more clearly and because if she decided to try to deck him he didnt want them broken youre angry because i brought equipment here and ran tests on nell bingo i invited you here to my home its not a goddamn lab its also nells home he pointed out i wouldnt have brought anything if she hadnt agreed you wheedled her i can wheedle when i have to he said equably i didnt have to the fact is she was interested shes exploring herself and this is part of it im sorry it upsets you i was afraid it would and if id been paying more attention to the time id have shut it all down before you got home so youd have hidden it from me thats a nice touch his own temper rumbled tough to win with you deputy no ive never hidden my work from you and i wouldnt have done so now but id have tried to respect your feelings about it as ive tried to do from the start then why he cut her off by holding up one finger the simple fact is this is my work and you have to deal with that but this is your home and my being here under these circumstances upsets you ill apologize for that itll only take me about fifteen minutes to break this down and get it out ill tell nell ill take a rain check on dinner oh stop being such a jerk you know ripley you just keep pushing and pushing until nobody wins when he turned away to remove his camera from the tripod she reached up pulled her own hair until the sharp pain cleared her head maybe i do i didnt ask you to leave what are you asking i dont know i come home after a pisser of a day im tired and im irritable and i walk in on you doing your mad scientist routine with nell whos obviously not only cooperating but enjoying the hell out of it i wanted a damn beer and a hot shower not a confrontation understandable i can only apologize for the timing it doesnt change the fact that this is what i do no it doesnt nor she realized with a twinge did it change the fact that shed jumped down his throat because of it that hed expected her to not only was she being a bitch she was being a predictable bitch it was lowering you missed a level he packed his camera closed up his laptop which is i want to know why you didnt ask me i couldnt ask you if youd mind if i ran tests with nell because you werent here to be asked no why didnt you ask me to run them with you as he stopped unhooking cables to stare at her she shrugged i think its rude that you went to nell before you came to me just when he thought he had her pegged she changed the pattern on him would you have agreed i dont know she huffed out a breath maybe id have thought about it anyway but you didnt ask are you serious or are you just using this angle to twist things up so i come out being a jerk there was no arguing that however geeky he might be from time to time his mind was a scalpel that cut through all the bullshit in one swipe the jerk parts just a side benefit i shouldnt have jumped on you that way taken jabs at you and your work im sorry for it now youre apologizing i have to sit down dont milk it booke but she went to him laid her hands on his arms why dont you get us those beers then while im taking that hot shower you can explain to me what all this stuffs for maybe ill let you use it on me i can do that he reached up to take her hands before she could slide them away but i have a question first why are you considering it now because its like you said its your work your deal i respect you mac so it looks like im going to have to start respecting what you do not one of his professional or academic accolades had ever given him such pleasure as that one hardwon statement did he stepped closer to her framed her face with his hands thank you youre welcome youre still a jerk understood he felt her lips curve into a smile under his when he kissed her paranormal science now see there you lose me right at the kickoff ripley complained because to me thats an oxymoron they were in her bedroom with her sitting crosslegged on the bed while he set up his equipment there was a time when astronomy was considered outside the mainstream if science doesnt push the accepted scope study the possibilities it stagnates we dont learn anything by standing still science and education are part of what turned magic from the acceptable into the condemned then into the dismissed youre right but i would add ignorance intolerance and fear to that mix its science and education that may in time turn the tide back again they hunted us down slaughtered us and countless others it was in her voice he thought cold rage hot fear you cant forgive that could you she moved her shoulders restlessly i dont dwell on it but it pays to remember what can happen when fingers start to point youre worried about what might happen to you if outsiders look too close i can take care of myself just as the sisters took care of themselves do you know how many witches were hanged in salem town mac none she said before he could speak all were innocent powerless victims so youre a cop he said because youve chosen to protect the innocent and the powerless as others once werent protected she started to speak then just hissed out her breath you dont have to be a superhero to keep order on three sisters thats not the point though is it you protect mia educates books and nell nurtures youve all chosen to do what you can to heal old wounds to balance thats all a little deep for me he ran his hand gently over her hair before he bent down to hook up cables the gesture the simple gentleness of it loosened every muscle in her body have you ever been hypnotized just as that question tightened all her muscles up again no why he glanced back at her briefly casually id like to try it im licensed you didnt do that weird stuff with nell ill ignore the word weird no i didnt use hypnosis with nell i didnt want to push it but you and i have a different relationship and i like to think a different level of trust i wouldnt hurt you i know that it probably wouldnt work on me anyway thats part of what id like to see its a simple process based on relaxation techniques and perfectly safe im not afraid good why dont you lie down just wait panic ticked at her throat how come you cant just follow the same routine you did downstairs with nell before dinner i could id like to add a few tests if youre willing first im interested in seeing if your gift makes you more or less susceptible to hypnosis and if you can be hypnotized if youre able to demonstrate power in that state have you considered that in that state i might not have perfect control he nodded absently while he nudged her back on the bed that would be interesting wouldnt it interesting jesus youll recall that mia fried one of your toys when she was a little miffed that was cool but she didnt hurt me he reminded ripley and neither will you im just going to hook you up now i explained what the machines are for yeah yeah you need to lose the sweater she glanced toward the camera smirked so do you and your fellow geeks watch these tapes at stag parties absolutely nothing like watching a video of a halfnaked woman to break up the tedium of lab work he kissed her forehead before affixing the first electrode but ill keep this one in my private collection he took her through the same steps as he had nell casual questions monitoring and recording her resting vital signs there was a slight shift when he asked her to do a small basic spell anxiety he noted she wasnt completely comfortable opening herself to power but she obliged and the lights in the adjoining bath switched off and on rapidly i used to do that when zack was in the shower when we were kids she said just to piss him off give me something bigger more demanding her heart rate was up more than nells had been anxiety again he decided but the brainwave patterns were remarkably similar she cupped her hands lifted them he saw the ball of light glow then shoot up to the ceiling another followed still another as he watched them take position he grinned its a baseball field infield outfield nine players batter up she said and sent another light into her batters box i used to do this as a kid too and had missed it she realized when i couldnt sleep or didnt want to lets see how he likes a fastball another light small and blue shot out from the pitchers mound there was a snap of sound a burst of streaming light yes base hit deep right field lets stretch it into a triple forgetting his machines mac sat on the foot of the bed and watched marvelously entertained as she played through an entire inning keep it going he urged how old were you when you first recognized and used your gift i dont know it just always seemed to be there double play smooth as silk do you ever play on a terrestrial field sure hot corner ive got great hands you no too clumsy divide eightyfour by twelve struck him out and the side retires divide what thats math i hate math her brow furrowed you didnt say there was going to be a quiz give it a shot he told her and rose again to check the readings twelves one of the sucky ones hanging curveball low and outside its six no wait damn it seven seven times two is fourteen and carry the deal to the other deal seven so what excitement trickled through him but all that showed in his voice was amusement so you strained your left brain a bit but maintained the pattern she breezed through the backward alphabet he wasnt entirely sure what that said about her mind or her personality but her readings remained high and steady okay close the spell but ive got a man out and a man on well pick it up later this is starting to feel like school she complained but opened her hands again and drew the lights down extinguished them i need you to relax again breathe in through your nose out gently through your mouth slow deep breaths ready to pout about the game delay she looked over at him and saw what nell had seen cool calm control im relaxed enough breathe ripley count the beats slow deep easy he sat on the side of the bed with her checked her pulse with his fingers relax your toes my what your toes let your toes relax let all the tension slide out im not tense but he felt her pulse kick if this is your prelude to hypnosis its not going to work then it wont work watching her face he trailed his fingers to the pulse in the curve of her elbow back to her wrist soft steady strokes relax your feet youve been on them most of the day let the tension go out of them out of your ankles his voice was so quiet so soothing his fingers on her skin were a lovely light connection relax your calves its like warm water flowing up through your body washing out the tension your minds relaxing too just let it empty out your knees are relaxing now your thighs visualize a soft white field nothing on it its easy on the eyes it relaxes them he drew the pendant from under his shirt wrapped the chain twice around his hand breathe in the calm expel the tension its safe here you can just drift arent you supposed to tell me im getting sleepy ssh breathe focus on the pendant her pulse jumped again when he held it up in her line of vision thats mias relax focus youre safe you know you can trust me she moistened her lips this isnt going to work anyway the pendants in front of that white wall its all you can see all you need to see let your mind clear just look at the pendant listen to my voice its all you need to hear he took her down in stages gently until her eyelids began to droop then slid her deep subject is unusually susceptible to hypnosis vital signs are steady readings typical for a trance state ripley can you hear me yes i want you to remember that youre safe and that youre not to do anything that youre not willing to do and comfortable doing if i ask you to do anything that you dont want to do youre to tell me no do you understand yes are you able to stir the air yes will you do so gently she lifted her arms as if for an embrace and the air moved over him like a soft wave of water how does that make you feel he asked her i cant explain happy and afraid afraid of what i want it too much want too much of it close the spell he ordered it wasnt fair to ask her questions like that he reminded himself she hadnt agreed to it before hed put her under remember the lights the baseball lights can you bring them back im not supposed to play after bedtime she said and her voice had changed subtly become younger and full of mischief but i do he stared at her rather than the lights she threw toward the ceiling subject has regressed without direct suggestion the childhood game appears to have triggered the event the scientist in him wanted to pursue it but the man couldnt follow through ripley youre not a little girl i want you to stay in this time and place mia and i had fun if i didnt have to grow up wed still be friends it was said sulkily her mouth in a pout as she played the lights i need you to stay in this time and this place she let out a long sigh yes im here can i touch one of the lights it wont hurt you i dont want to hurt you she brought one down until it hovered above his hands he could trace it with his finger a perfect circle its beautiful whats inside you is beautiful some is dark as she said it her body arched and the lights flew around the room like bright stars instinctively mac ducked the lights began to whistle shrilly and pulse bloodred close the spell somethings here its come to hunt to feed her hair began to twist into wild curls its come back one times three ripley lights flew past his face as he rushed back to her close the spell i want you to close the spell and come back im going to count back from ten she needs you to guide the way im bringing her back mac gripped shoulders he knew were no longer ripleys you have no right to take her she is mine and i am hers show her the way show her her way she must not take mine or we are lost ripley focus on my voice on my voice it took all his control to keep his voice soothing firm but calm come back now when i reach one youll wake up he brings death he craves it he wont get it mac snapped ten nine eight youre waking up slowly seven six youre going to feel relaxed refreshed five four youll remember everything youre safe come back now wake up ripley three two one as he counted down he saw her come back not just to the surface of consciousness but physically as her eyelids fluttered the lights vanished and the room was still she breathed out swallowed holy shit she managed then found herself plucked off the bed into his lap and crushed in his arms seventeen he couldnt let her go couldnt stop blaming himself for taking chances with her nothing hed seen experienced theorized had ever terrified him the way watching ripley change in front of him had done its all right she stroked his back patted it then realizing they were both trembling she wrapped her arms around his neck and held tight im okay he shook his head buried his face in her hair i should be shot since gentle soothing wasnt working she switched tactics into something more natural to her get a grip booke she ordered and shoved at him no harm no foul i took you under left you open he pulled back and she could see it wasnt fear on his face but fury it hurt you i could see it then you were gone no i wasnt his reaction had given her little time for one of her own now her stomach quivered something had come into her no she thought that wasnt quite right something had come over her i was here she said slowly as she tried to puzzle it out for herself it was like being underwater not like drowning or sinking but just floating it didnt hurt more of a quick shock then the drift her brows drew together as she thought it through cant say i cared for it though i dont like the idea of being tucked aside so someone else can have her say how do you feel now fine actually i feel great stop taking my pulse doc let me get these things off you but when he started to remove the electrodes she closed a hand over his wrist hold on what did you get out of all that a reminder he bit off the words to be more cautious no you dont think like a scientist the way you were when we started this youre supposed to be objective right fuck objectivity come on mac we cant just toss the results out the window tell me im interested when he frowned at her she sighed its not just your deal now i have a pretty personal interest in what went on here she was right because she was right he dug down for calm how much do you remember all of it i think for a minute i was eight years old it was kind of cool you started to regress on your own he pressed his fingers to his temples clear the brain he ordered himself bag the emotion and give her some answers maybe the game was the trigger he considered if you want a quick analysis id say you went back to a time when you werent conflicted subconsciously you needed to go back to a time when things were simpler and you didnt question yourself you used to enjoy your gift yeah and for a while the craft the learning the refining i guess youd say restless now she moved her shoulders and then you get a little older and you start thinking about the weight the consequences he laid a hand on her cheek this all of this troubles you well things arent simple now are they they havent been for me for ten years he said nothing watching her patiently words trembled on her tongue then began to spill out in a flood i could see in dreams how it might be if i took a step too far if i didnt strap it in wasnt careful enough and sometimes in those dreams it felt good amazingly good to do whatever i wanted whenever i wanted screw the rules but you never did he said quietly instead you just stopped it all when sam logan left mia she was a wreck i kept thinking why the hell doesnt she do something about it make him pay the son of a bitch make him suffer the way shes suffering and i thought of what id do what i could do nobody would hurt me that way because if they tried she shuddered i imagined it and almost before i realized a bolt of light shot out of the sky a black bolt of light barbed like an arrow i sank zacks boat she said with a weak smile nobody was in it but they could have been he could have been and i wouldnt have been able to stop it no control just anger he laid a hand on her leg rubbed how old were you not quite twenty but that doesnt matter she said fiercely you know that doesnt matter and it harm none thats vital and i couldnt be sure i could keep that pledge god hed been in that damn boat not twenty minutes before it happened i wasnt thinking of him wasnt concerned about him or anyone i was just mad so you denied yourself your gift and your friend i had to there was no one without the other in this theyre too twined together she would never have understood or accepted and damn it shed never have stopped nagging at me plus i was pissed at her because she knuckled a tear away and said aloud what shed refused to admit even to herself i felt her pain like it was my own physically felt it her grief her despair her desperate love for him and i couldnt stand it we were too close and i couldnt breathe its been as hard on you as it has on her maybe harder i guess ive never told anybody any of this id appreciate it if we kept it between us he nodded and when his lips brushed hers they were warm youll have to talk to mia sooner or later i choose later she sniffled again rubbed her face briskly lets move on okay or i guess its back you got your readings you got your tape she said nodding at his equipment i didnt think youd be able to put me under i keep underestimating you it was relaxing even pleasant she pushed back her heavy hair and then what then he prompted he didnt have to check his machines to know her heart rate and respiration were spiking it was like something was trying to get it claw its way in something crouched and waiting boy that sounds dramatic and though she laughed at herself she drew her knees up protectively not her it wasnt her it was something else it hurt you no but it wanted to then i was sliding underwater and she was the surface i cant explain it any other way thats good enough i dont see whats good about it i couldnt control it like i couldnt control what happened to zacks boat couldnt control what i started with the lights tonight even though she was inside me some part of her it didnt seem as if she could control it either like the power was caught somewhere between up for grabs she shivered and felt her skin grow icy i dont want to do this anymore okay well stop he took her hands soothed im going to put everything away though she nodded she knew he didnt understand her she didnt want any of it any longer but she was afraid deeply afraid that she wasnt going to be given the choice something was coming she thought for her he tucked her in like a baby and she let him when he drew her close to comfort her in the dark she pretended to sleep he stroked her hair and she felt the beginning of tears if she was normal if she was ordinary her life could be like this she thought bitterly she could be held close in the dark by the man she loved a simple thing everything if shed never met him shed have been content to go on as she was enjoying a man now and then when he caught her fancy and her interest whether or not she would have embraced her powers again she couldnt be sure but her heart would have remained her own once you gave your heart you risked more than self you risked the one who held it how could she weary of the worry she breathed him in and gave herself to sleep the storm was back cold and bitter it drove the sea into a frenzy of sound and fury lightning blasted over the sky shattering it like glass black rain gushed from the shards to be hurled like frozen barbs by the wicked wind the storm was feral and she ruled it power fueled her pumping through muscle and bone with such glorious strength here was an energy beyond anything shed known before had believed possible and with this force at her fingertips she would have vengeance no no justice it wasnt vengeance to seek punishment for wrongs to demand it to mete it out with a clear mind but her mind wasnt clear even in the throes of her hunger she knew it and feared it she was damning herself she looked down at the man who cowered at her feet what was power if it couldnt be used to right wrongs to stop evil to punish the wicked if you do this it ends in violence in hopelessness her griefstricken sisters stood in the circle and she without i have the right no one does do this and you rip out the heart of the gift the soul of what you are she was already lost i cant stop it you can only you can come stand with us its he who will destroy you she looked down and saw the face of the man change features over features that slid from terror to glee to plea to hunger no he ends here she threw up a hand lightning exploded arrowed down to her fingertips and became a silver sword with what is mine i take your life to right the wrong and end the strife for justice i set my fury free and take the path of destiny from this place and from this hour thrilled darkly thrilled she lifted the sword high as he screamed i will taste the ripe fruit of power blood for blood i now decree as i will so mote it be she brought the sword down in one vicious swipe he smiled as its tip sliced flesh and he vanished the night screamed the earth trembled and through the storm the one she loved came running stay back she shouted stay away but he fought his way through the gale reaching for her from the tip of her sword lightning erupted and arrowed into his heart ripley come on honey wake up now its a bad dream she was sobbing with it and the wrenching grief in the sound worried him more than the trembling i couldnt stop it i killed him i couldnt make it stop its over now he fumbled for the bedside lamp but couldnt find the switch instead he simply sat up with her cuddled her rocked its all over now youre okay wake up he kissed her damp cheeks her forehead her arms banded around him like steel mac thats right im here you had a nightmare do you want me to turn on the light get you some water no just no hold on to me a minute okay absolutely not a nightmare she thought as she let herself cling to him but a vision a blend of what had been and what would be shed recognized the face the faces of the man on the beach one she had seen in other dreams hed died three centuries before cursed by the one called earth another she had first seen in the woods by the yellow cottage when hed held a knife to nells throat and the third she had seen in the café reading a newspaper and eating soup three parts of one whole three steps in one fate god how was she to know she had killed them in the end shed seen herself standing in the storm with her sword in her hand shed killed because she could because the need had been so huge and the payment horribly dear it had been mac shed seen running through the storm mac whod been struck down because she couldnt control what was inside her i wont let it happen she whispered i wont tell me tell me about the dream itll help no this will she lifted her mouth to his poured herself into the kiss touch me god make love with me i need to be with you fresh tears spilled as she melted against him i need you to comfort to fill to want she would take this and give it this last time all that might have been all that she had let herself wish would gather together and stream into this perfect act of love she could see him in the dark every feature every line every plane was etched on mind and heart how could she have fallen so deeply so hopelessly in love shed never believed herself capable of it never wanted it yet here it was aching inside her he was the beginning and the end for her and she had no words to tell him he needed none he tumbled into her the yield and demand there was a tenderness here a depth to it that neither had explored before swamped by it he murmured her name he wanted to give her everything heart mind body to warm her with his hands and mouth to hold her safe forever she rose to him drew him down met his sigh with her own love was like a feast and each supped slowly a gentle caress a melting of lips a quiet need that stirred souls she opened and he filled warmth enclosed in warmth they moved together in the seamless dark beat for sustained beat while pleasure bloomed and ripened his lips brushed at her tears and the taste of them was lovely in the dark his hands found hers linked youre all there is she heard him say it tenderly and as the wave rose to sweep them both it was soft as silk in the dark she slept away the rest of the night in his arms without dreams morning had to come she was prepared for it there were steps to be taken and she would take them without hesitation and she promised herself without regret she slipped out of the house early she took one last glance at mac how he looked sleeping peacefully in her bed for a moment she allowed herself to imagine what might have been then she closed the door and didnt look back she could hear nell already up and singing in the kitchen and knew her brother would be up and starting the day soon she needed to get a jump on it she left by the front door heading for the village and the station house at a brisk jog the wind and rain had died in the night under clear skies the air had turned bitter again she could hear the pounding of the sea the surf would still be high and wild and the beach littered with whatever the water had cast out but there would be no long freeing run for her that morning the village was as still as a painting captured under a crystalline coating of ice she imagined it waking yawning stretching and cracking that thin sheath like an eggshell determined that her home and everyone on it would wake safe she unlocked the door of the station house it was chilly inside and warned her they were running on emergency power lost power during the night and the generator kicked on she imagined that she and zack would be busy later dealing with any of the residents who didnt have backup power but that was later with a check of the time she booted up the computer she could run it off the battery long enough to get what she needed jonathan q harding she rolled her shoulders and began her search the basic police work steadied her it was routine it was second nature her stop at the hotel had garnered her his home address or the address hed given she reminded herself now she would see just who the hell he was and with that begin to piece together the puzzle of what part he played in her personal drama she scanned the data as it scrolled onscreen harding jonathan quincy age fortyeight divorced no children los angeles la she repeated and felt the little quiver shed experienced when shed gotten his city of residence from the hotel registration evan remington was from los angeles so were a lot of other people she reminded herself as she had the day before but there wasnt as much conviction in it this time around she read his employment information a magazine writer reporter son of a bitch looking for a hot story harding well its not going to happen you just try getting through me to nell and she broke off blew out a breath and deliberately consciously tamped down on the instinctive anger there had been other reporters she reminded herself gawkers parasites and the curious theyd handled it without any real trouble they would handle this one the same way she went back to the data noting that harding had no criminal record not even an outstanding parking violation so he was by all appearances a lawabiding sort she sat back considered if she were a reporter from la looking for a story where would she start remingtons family was a good bet his sister then some friends some associates research the key players who included nell from there police reports probably interviews with people who had known both remington and nell but that was all background wasnt it you couldnt get to the meat until youd talked directly to the main characters she snatched up the phone intending to contact the facility where remington was being held and heard the line crackle and die first the power she thought now the phones muttering complaints she yanked out her cell phone hit power and ground her teeth when the display announced that her battery was dead damn it goddamn it pushing herself out of the chair she paced there was an urgency in her now whether it was the cop the woman or the witch pushing didnt seem to matter she had to know if harding had met with remington all right then she steadied herself again it was imperative to stay calm and controlled it had been a long time since shed attempted a flight she had no tools with her to help focus her energy and though she wished just once for mia she accepted that in this she was on her own struggling not to rush she cast the circle and in its center cleared her mind and opened i call to all who hold the power unto me your help endower rise up the wind to aid my flight open your eyes to aid my sight my body remains but my spirit flies free as i will so mote it be it was like a drawing up a tingling that flowed gently through the body then a lifting out of what she was from the shell that held it she glanced down at her own form the ripley who stood head lifted eyes closed in the circle knowing the risks of lingering of becoming too charmed by the sensation of flight she centered her thoughts on her target and let herself soar the stream of the wind the sea beneath there was such joy in it and that she knew was a dangerous seduction before she could be lulled into the glorious silence and motion she let sounds fill her head voices humming the thoughts and the speech of an entire city were alive within her worries joys tempers passions mixed together in such a wonderfully human music as she traveled sliding downward she separated them and found what she needed there was no change overnight one nurse handed a chart to another their thoughts sent up a mild interference complaints fatigue a remembered fight with a spouse and one gnawing desire for ice cream well hes less trouble in a coma strange though the way he dropped just a couple of hours after that reporter left hed been alert stable responsive for days then this complete turnaround as the nurses moved down the corridor one of them shivered slightly as ripley passed wow got a chill she moved through the closed door and into the room where remington lay machines monitored his vital signs cameras watched him ripley hovered studying him comatose restrained behind lock and key what harm could he do now even as she thought it his eyes opened and grinned into hers she felt a stab in the heart the pain unbelievably sharp and completely real the power in her around her wavered and she felt herself falling his thoughts beat at her mind bloody vicious fists that spoke of vengeance death destruction they pinched at her greedy fingers that were somehow hideously arousing tempting her to surrender and more than surrender tempting her to take no you wont have me or mine she fought back struggling to free herself little wings of panic fluttered at her throat as she realized the sheer strength of what had come alive in him she tore free with a cry of both fury and fear and found herself sprawled in the circle shed cast on the simple wood floor of the station house wincing in pain she tore open her shirt and stared down in horror at the angry red welts between her breasts she struggled to her feet found the control to close the circle she was stumbling for the firstaid kit when the door burst open mia flew in the door like a whirlwind what the hell do you think youre doing instinctively ripley drew her shirt closed whatre you doing here did you think i wouldnt know all but shaking with anger mia closed the distance between them i wouldnt feel how dare you do such a thing on your own without proper preparation do you know what you risked it was my risk and youve got no business spying on me you risked everything and you know it just as you know i wasnt spying you woke me out of a lovely little dream ripley angled her head took a good look mias hair was in wild disarray her mouth unpainted and her cheeks pale now that you mention it you didnt take time to put on your war paint i dont think ive seen you without makeup since we were fifteen even without it ill always look better than you particularly now youre bone white sit down sit she repeated and solved the problem by pushing ripley into a chair mind your own business you unfortunately are my business if you wanted to check on remington why didnt you just look dont lecture me mia you know i have less luck with that area than you plus i didnt have a glass or a ball or a cup of water would do as youre perfectly aware its foolishly dangerous to fly without a partner someone who can call you back should it be necessary well it wasnt necessary i got back fine you could have asked me for help sorrow pierced the frustration by the goddess ripley do you hate me that much simple shock had ripley dropping her hands gaping i dont hate you i couldnt what have you done to yourself temper vanished as mia saw the welts moving quickly she pulled ripleys shirt aside and her soul shuddered he did this how is it possible you were in the circle hes just a man how could he break the protection and do this to your corporal body hes not just a man ripley said flatly not anymore theres something in him and its very strong and very dark part of its here theres a man at the hotel she told mia what she knew as she would tell nell they needed to be prepared i need to study mia said to think well find the answer in the meantime do you still have your amulet any of your protective stones mia dont be a fool not now wear the amulet recharge it first you have to stay away from this harding until we know more i know that im not going to let this happen mia i need you to promise you wont stop me however it has to be done well find a way let me tend to those burns youll stop me ripley repeated taking mias wrist squeezing urgently youre stronger than i am and you know just how close i am to the edge to admit that what needs to be done will be done impatient mia pushed ripleys hand away these are painful let me tend to them for a minute the burn was arousing ripley took a steadying breath seductive i wanted it and what it would do to me thats part of its slyness but fear cold and clammy shivered over mias skin you know that too yeah i know it and now ive felt it you and nell can hold out against it and nell stands in front of zack but i saw what could happen and im not taking any chances i cant leave it wont work so macs going to have to go he wont mia soothed the welts with her fingertips ill make him with her hand on ripleys heart mia felt the beat that was love and fear her own ached in sympathy you can try steps to be taken ripley reminded herself as she approached the yellow cottage this one most of all had to be faced she didnt need second sight or a ball of crystal to foresee that it would be painful more painful than the raw welts that even mia hadnt been able to erase completely from her skin he might hate her when she was done but he would be safe she didnt hesitate but knocked then strolled in dressed in a ragged sweatshirt and rattier jeans he stood in the crowded bedroom he was reviewing the tape from the night before it was a jolt to see him on the monitor so calm so unruffled so steady sitting on the bed beside her gently taking her pulse while his voice reassured a jolt to see him glance over at her now to see the concentration in his eyes then the easy pleasure that warmed them he stood blocking the monitor with his body then switching it off hi you snuck off on me this morning had stuff she said with a shrug back at work huh it can wait how about some coffee yeah thatd be good she didnt avoid the kiss but neither did she respond she knew he was puzzled so she breezed by him into the kitchen i wanted to talk to you she began i know weve been hanging out a lot hanging out yeah weve got a real nice sizzle between us especially between the sheets she sat stretching out her legs crossing her feet at the ankles but the thing is its getting a little intense for me wow last night especially really went over the top im going to have to back off back off he caught himself parroting her again shook his head i understand last nights session was rough he got down two mugs poured coffee you need a break from that youre not following me already bleeding inside she took the mug he offered its not just the work area ive got to admit i found it a lot more interesting than i thought i would brains are pretty sexy ive never hung out with a really smart guy before she sipped the coffee burned her tongue and kept right on talking look mac youre really a nice guy and i think we both had a good time you even helped me clear my head about a lot of stuff i appreciate that do you there he was she thought looking at her as if she were a bug on a slide you bet but im starting to feel a little you know confined i need to move on i see his voice was calm just a bit detached so youre dumping me thats a little harsh he wasnt reacting as shed expected he didnt look angry upset hurt shocked he simply looked mildly interested why dont we keep it friendly and just say its been fun okay he leaned back on the counter crossing his long legs at the ankles in a move that eerily mirrored hers then sipped his coffee its been fun great a little sliver of resentment worked through pricking her heart and her voice figured you for a reasonable type which is probably why youre not really my type i guess youll be heading back to new york pretty soon no not for several more weeks i dont see the point in staying i dont want to play anymore i guess i have to make sure youre not the center of my universe then i still have work to do on the sisters you wont get any more cooperation from me look im just thinking of how youre going to feel its a small world here people are going to know i broke things off its going to be embarrassing for you let me worry about that fine not my problem she pushed to her feet no its not he spoke pleasantly as he set his mug aside she never saw it coming one second he was studying her with that vague curiosity and the next hed yanked her against him his mouth was like a fever on hers hot angry draining why are you lying to me she was out of breath and her thoughts had scattered like ants hands off why are you lying he repeated and backed her up against the refrigerator door detached she thought wildly had she thought he was detached where did all this bull come from he gave her one quick shake why are you trying to hurt me and it did hurt a deep throbbing ache in the pit of his stomach a slow twisting twinge in the heart im not trying to hurt you but i will if you keep pushing yourself on me i dont want you youre a liar you held me when you slept i cant be responsible for what i do in my sleep you turned to me in the dark his voice was relentless a part of him felt as if he was fighting for his life you gave yourself to me sex is it wasnt sex he remembered how it had been for both of them his hands gentled and his anger became exasperation do you think you can trick me into turning away from you leaving the island why i dont want you here she shoved at him and her voice began to hitch i dont want you near me why because you moron im in love with you eighteen he ran his hands down her arms taking hers as he leaned over to touch his lips to her forehead well you idiot im in love with you too lets sit down and start there what what she would have pulled her hands free but he only tightened his grip back off no he said it gently no ripley i wont back off i wont go away and i wont stop loving you you might as well swallow that then we can work on whats scared you so much you want me gone mac if you love me youll pack up and go back to new york for a while it doesnt work that way no he repeated as she opened her mouth again dont be so damn implacable is a term ive heard applied to me occasionally its classier i think than hardheaded in this case however i dont think either applies he angled his head you get spooked about something worried about someone your instinct is to step away the way you did with your gift he continued over her protest the way you did with mia i wont let you do that with me with us ripley he lifted their joined hands kissed her knuckles im so in love with you dont her heart she thought couldnt take it just wait i hate to keep saying no to you ill make it up to you later and he lowered his head and kissed her until her bones went liquid i dont know what to do how to handle this ive never had this before me either well figure it out lets sit down and get started i told zack id be back in twenty minutes i didnt think it would take that long to to dump me he grinned at her surprise you want to call him she shook her head i cant think straight hell he knows where i am if he needs me it seemed as if everything inside her was jumping and twisting around and yet at the center of it her heart was glowing like the moon youre in love with me completely well she sniffled how come you never mentioned it before she demanded how come you didnt mention you were in love with me i asked you first got me there maybe i was building up to it you know he squeezed her arms before he nudged her into a chair softening you up maybe i was doing the same thing really telling me you were done with me is an odd way to accomplish that mac she leaned forward and this time she took his hands youre the first man ive ever said it to you have to be careful throwing that word around if youre careless with it casual with it it loses power youre the first because youre the first and for me youll be the only thats how it works with the todds we mate for life so you have to marry me his system kicked a quick boot i have to marry you yeah so that takes care of that hold on pleasure trickled through him dont i get a ring or something then you get down on one knee and ask and i say yes or no youre pushing your luck i feel lucky im buying a house oh there was a tug grief sorrow acceptance new york yeah well thats where your work is guess they always need cops there probably but im buying a house here do you think id ask you to leave your heart dont you know mines here now too she stared at him for one long moment she could do nothing but stare at him and saw their lives in his eyes dont make me cry i hate that i put in an offer on the logan place the big and beautiful and by the sea its not for sale oh but its going to be i can be very tenacious i want children so do i her fingers tightened on his itll be good with us good and solid and real but you have to do something for me first im not going away cant you trust me enough to do this one thing that wont work either tell me whats frightening you start with the dream last night she looked away from him i killed you how he asked sounding intrigued what have you got ice in your veins i ended your life your existence well figure out the solution faster if we dont panic tell me about the dream she shoved away from the table paced the room three times in tight little circles trying to burn off her agitation and told him and in telling him brought it all back so clearly that fear crawled through her like freshly hatched spiders i killed you and destroyed everything that matters she finished i cant carry that load mac cant deal with it its why i turned away from what i am turned away from mia it seemed the right the only thing to do part of me still thinks that but you know that wont work and that you have to face it youre asking me to risk you my family my friends my home no im not he said gently im asking you to protect us emotion totally swamped her god mac that was a big button to push i know it ill help you ripley i think i was meant to meant to love you he added taking her fisted hand smoothing it open to be a part of this i dont think my lifes work is a coincidence or my coming here or my sitting here with you right now and i know were stronger together than we are apart she looked down at their joined hands everything she wanted she realized and hadnt known she was looking for was right here in her grasp if i kill you its really going to piss me off his lips twitched me too are you wearing mias pendant yeah dont go anywhere without it or this she dug in her pocket she should have known where it was all heading when she felt compelled to bring it with her the ring was a complex twist of silver a trio of melded circles scored with symbols it was my grandmothers he was humbled and incredibly moved had to clear his throat so i get a ring after all looks like its going to be too small for your hand wear it on the chain with the pendant he took it from her squinting as he tried to make out the symbols without his glasses it looks celtic it is the middle circle says justice the ones on either side say compassion and love i guess that covers it its a beautiful piece he took off the chain opened it and slid the ring on thank you before he could slip the chain back over his head she gripped his wrist hypnotize me again its too dangerous dont give me that crap this is all too dangerous i want you to take me under give me some posthypnotic suggestion or whatever it is something that will stop me if i start to lose control in the first place youre too open to other energies when youre in a trance state you were like a sponge ripley soaking up what others poured into you and in the second place i have no idea if any suggestion would hold when youre conscious and aware youre too strongminded too strongwilled to be influenced in that way its another line of defense we dont know it wont work unless we try this is something you can do and im trusting you im asking you for help thats a hell of a button too okay well try it not now he added quickly i want some time to do a little more research and prepare and i want nell and mia here why cant this be just between us because its not ill try it but only when you have your circle now wait here a minute he said it in such a nononsense dontbothertoargue tone that ripley wasnt sure if she was irritated amused or impressed but she sat drumming her fingers on the table as he left the room while she listened to him rummaging around in the bedroom muttering to himself she drank the coffee shed let go cold when he came back he drew her to her feet i bought this in ireland a dozen years ago turning her hand over he placed a silver disk in her palm through its center ran a swirling rise of silver and on either side sat a small perfectly round stone rose quartz and moonstone ripley said for love and for compassion i bought it as a kind of talisman a good luck piece i always carry it with me cant find it half the time but it always turns up so i think its been pretty lucky it has a loop in the back so i imagine it was once worn as a pendant or you can just carry it in your pocket i didnt know it at the time but i bought it for you she rested her head on his shoulder this is going to make me mushy i dont mind i have to get back to work and i cant be all googlyeyed i really love you she told him as she turned her mouth up to his i really do he nudged her along careful not to behave as if he was nudging her along he had a great deal to do mac wasnt foolish enough to believe he couldnt be hurt even killed no he believed ripleys dream was a foretelling of what could be the cycle that had begun three hundred years before was still in play but he was also smart enough to know various means to protect himself and to believe that knowledge is power he would gather more knowledge and strengthen the shield over both of them he wouldnt risk putting her in a vulnerable trance state unless he was certain she would be safe he got out the copies of his ancestors journal entry and found the page he wanted february it is early before dawn cold and deep dark i have left my husband sleeping warm in bed and come to my tower room to write this a restlessness is on me a worry that nags like a bad tooth a mist hangs over the house like a shroud it presses against the glass i can hear it scratching sly little fingers made of bone how it craves to come in i have charmed the doors and windows and all the tiny cracks as my mother taught me before despair swallowed her spirit how long ago that was and yet on a night such as this it was only yesterday and i pine for her the comfort the strength the beauty of her with this chill seeping into my bones i wish for her counsel but it is barred to me even through crystal and glass it is not for myself i fear but for my childrens childrens children i have seen the world in my dreams a hundred years times three such wonders such magic such grief a cycle spins i cannot see it clearly but i know my blood before and after me spins with it strength purity wisdom and above all love will war with what now creeps outside my house it is ageless it is ever and it is dark blood of mine freed it and blood of mine will face it from this place and time i can do little more than protect what is now and pray for what will come i will leave what magic i can behind me for these beloved and distant children evil cannot and will not be vanquished by evil dark will only swallow dark and deepen the good and the light are the keenest weapons let those who come after hold them ready and end this in time beneath was a charm written in gaelic that mac had already translated he studied it again now hoping that the message from the past would help with the now harding felt better than he had in days the vague fatigue that had dogged him was put down to recovery from whatever bug had invaded his system but his mind was clear and he was certain hed passed the crisis in fact he felt well enough to be annoyed that a touch of the flu had thrown him off stride and off schedule he fully intended to rectify that by approaching nell todd that very day for his first interview in preparation for it he decided to have a light breakfast and a large pot of coffee in his room so that he could go over his notes refresh his memory of the details and plan the best strategy for persuading her to talk to him for his book the idea of the book and the money and glamour he intended to reap from it filled him with anticipation for days it seemed he hadnt been able to think of it clearly to imagine it to remember just what it was that he planned to do it was as if his mind had been locked away behind some thick door and whenever it had fought its way clear again had been too tired to function while he waited for his breakfast he showered and shaved looking at himself in the mirror he admitted that he didnt look his best he was pale a bit gaunt not that he couldnt get by without the pounds he could clearly see hed shed but the dark circles haunting his eyes offended his vanity he considered using a portion of his imagined advance for the book for a little nip and tuck and a regenerative stay in some posh spa after he had completed his initial interview with the former helen remington he would finish putting his book proposal together and send it to the new york agent hed contacted about the idea in the bedroom he considered the choice between tailored suit and the more casual look of slacks and sweater he opted for the casual more friendly approachable that was the image for nell todd rather than the formal business attire hed used with evan remington as he thought of remington a wave of dizziness washed over him forcing him to grip the closet door to steady himself not quite a hundred percent yet he thought he would feel better he was certain after breakfast his next shock came when he put on his slacks they gapped at the waist bagged at the hips he realized hed lost at least ten pounds during his bout with the flu perhaps more though his hands shook a bit as he cinched his belt in the last notch he told himself he could take advantage of this unexpected development he would just keep the weight off start an exercise program watch his diet more carefully hed look fit and trim for public appearances when his book was published by the time he sat down to breakfast at the table that room service had set up by the window hed convinced himself he was perfectly fine in fact better than ever with his first cup of coffee he gazed out the window the sun was bright almost too bright as it bounced off the ice that seemed to slick every surface he found it odd that the strength of that sun didnt appear to be melting any of the ice and that the village street seemed so still as if it was genuinely frozen a bug in amber he hoped the bookstore wasnt closed because of the weather he preferred to approach nell todd there this first time she would feel safer he imagined and more inclined to listen to his pitch he might also be able to set up an interview with mia devlin as the person whod hired nell whod rented her a house when she had first come to the island the devlin woman would add a great deal to the book more mia devlin was reputed to be a witch not that harding himself actually believed in such nonsense but something unusual had gone on in the forest the night remington had been taken into custody and the devlin angle was worth exploring blue lightning a shining circle snakes under the skin harding shuddered despite himself and began to look over his notes he could approach nell todd tempering his request for information with his admiration for her courage and intelligence and quite sincerely too harding admitted what she had done had taken guts skill and brains he would flatter her ego tell her how he had followed her trail across the country interviewed dozens of people shed worked for or with and ah yes he mused flipping a page in his notebook appeal to her sense of compassion her duty to others who found themselves in abusive situations a beacon of hope he scribbled down hastily a shining example of courage female empowerment for some escape is an option too terrifying to be considered or too far beyond their crushed spirits confirm latest statistics on spousal abuse womens shelters victims of marital homicides select family therapist to interview re most common causes effects results interview other survivors batterers potential comparisons and confirmations pleased that his thoughts were flowing smoothly again harding began to eat conception often cubbyholes victims of this nature as being part of an abuse cycle helen remington nell channing todd appears to have no such cycle in her background continue research into childhood obtain statistics on what portion of abuse victims have no such activities in their previous home life a cycle however must have a beginning from all appearances this cycle began and ended with evan remington harding continued to write but his concentration began to waver his fingers dug into the pen and the pen into the paper bitch whore burn the witch minemineminemineminemine blood death vengeance vengeance is mine is mine is mine he flipped pages rapidly slashing words over them as his breath quickened and the writing that was not his own all but scorched the paper they must die they all must die and i will live again when he came back to himself his notebook was neatly closed his pen set aside and he was nonchalantly drinking coffee gazing out the window and planning his day he thought it might be wise to take a nice long walk to be out exercising in the fresh air he could fill in several areas of description of the island take a closer look at the cottage where nell had lived when shed first arrived it was certainly time he had a personal look at the woods where remington had chased her that night feeling comfortably full harding tucked away his notebook secured a fresh one he slipped it along with a small tape recorder and a camera into his pockets and set out to work he remembered nothing hed written nor the bloodlust that had gushed inside him as hed done so nineteen the yellow cottage stood quiet at the edge of the little forest the trees were bare and black and cast short shadows on the ground within them was utter silence there were thin lacy curtains at the windows and the glass sparkled in the bright sunlight nothing stirred not a blade of winter grass not a single crisp brown leaf there seemed to be no sound at all though the sea was close and the village just at his back as he stood staring at the house by the wood harding thought it was like studying a photograph taken by someone else a frozen moment given to him for reasons he couldnt explain he felt a chill run up his spine his body shook with it and his breath came hard and fast he took one stumbling step back but it seemed as if he was rammed against a wall and could not turn and run as he so suddenly wanted to do then as quickly as the sensation had come it passed he was only standing on the roadside looking at a pretty cottage by a winter wood he would definitely get a checkup when he got back to the mainland he decided as he took one shaky step forward obviously he was under more stress than he had realized once he had all the background data and research for the book organized he would take that vacation just a week or two to recoup and recharge before he got down to the serious work of writing cheered by that thought he continued toward the woods now he could hear the soft and steady heartbeat of the sea the careless call of birds the light rustling of wind through naked branches he shook his head as he marched into the trees and glanced around with the suspicious condescension of a confirmed urbanite for the solitude of nature why anyone would choose to live in such a place was beyond him yet helen remington had done so shed given up great wealth a privileged lifestyle a beautiful home and a gilded social standing and for what to cook for strangers to live on a rocky lump of land and one day he imagined to raise a brood of squalling brats stupid bitch his hands clenched and unclenched as he walked beneath his feet a dirty fog began to churn to boil over his shoes he quickened his pace nearly running now though the ground was slick and patched with ice his breath came out in visible streams ungrateful whore she had to be punished to be hurt she and all the others had to pay would pay for everything theyd done they would die and if they dared challenge his power dared challenge his rights they would die in agony the fog ate along the ground and spilled at the edges of a circle that pulsed with a soft white glow his lips peeled back and a feral growl sounded deep in his throat he lunged at the ring and was repelled light rose from the circle a thin sparkling curtain of gold in fury he threw himself against it time and time again it burned white fire scorching his skin smoking his clothing as rage devoured him what was inside the body of jonathan q harding threw itself on the ground howling and cursing the light nell made up two orders of the days lunch special she hummed while she worked and toyed with adjustments to the menu for the wedding she was catering at the end of the month business was good sisters catering had found its feet and even in the slow winter months kept her busy and content but not so much so that she hadnt eked out time to work on a proposal for mia a cooking club in café book and an expanded menu were both very doable once she had the details more refined she would present the idea to mia businesswoman to businesswoman after she served the orders she glanced at the time another half hour and peg would relieve her she had a dozen errands to run and two appointments to discuss other catering jobs shed have to move fast she thought to get everything done in time to put dinner together the simple chaos of housewifely chores and business obligations piled together in overlapping layers made her happy but there were serious issues to be faced she couldnt deny it dinner that night wasnt just a social function she understood macs concern and the need to focus her energies on what was to come but she had already faced the worst and survived whatever had to be done to protect who and what she loved would be done she strolled out to clear a table in the café pocketed her tip tip money went in a special jar and was considered her splurge money paychecks were for expenses catering profits would be plowed back into the business but tip money was for fun it jingled cheerfully in her pocket as she turned to carry the plates and bowls back to the kitchen she stopped short then rushed forward when she saw harding standing by the counter staring blankly at the chalkboard menu mr harding what happened are you all right he stared at her through her you should sit down quickly she put the dishes on the counter took his arm she led him around the counter and back into the kitchen he sank into the chair she pulled out for him and she rushed to the sink to get a glass of water what happened i dont know he took the glass gratefully gulped down the cool water his throat felt scorched and raw as though it had been scored with hot needles im going to fix you some tea and some chicken soup he simply nodded staring down at his hands the nails were full of grit as if hed clawed at dirt the knuckles were abraded the palms scraped he saw that his trousers were stained with dirt his shoes filthy bits of twig and briar clung to his sweater it embarrassed him a fastidious man to find himself in such disarray might i wash my hands yes of course nell tossed a worried look over her shoulder a red streak like sunburn covered half his face it looked vicious painful and frightening she led him to the rest room waited for him outside the door and then walked him back to the kitchen she ladled the soup brewed the tea while he stood as if in a trance mr harding she spoke gently now touching his shoulder please sit down youre not well no i he felt vaguely nauseous i must have fallen he blinked rapidly why couldnt he remember hed taken a walk in the woods on a bright winter afternoon and could remember nothing he let her tend him the way the very young or the very old allow themselves to be tended he spooned up the warm soothing soup and it comforted his aching throat and uneasy stomach he drank her herbal tea sweetened with a generous dollop of honey and he basked in the sympathetic silence she gave him i must have fallen he said again i havent been feeling quite well lately the scents of the kitchen were so appealing her movements as she took and filled more orders so graceful and efficient that his anxiety receded he remembered his research on her and the admiration hed felt when hed followed her path across the country he would write a very good story book about her he thought one that spoke of courage and triumph ungrateful whore the words echoed dimly in his head and made him tremble nell studied him with concern you should go to the clinic he shook his head i prefer seeing my own doctor i appreciate your concern mrs todd your kindness i have something for that burn burn just a minute she moved out of the kitchen again spoke to peg whod just come on for her shift when she came back in nell opened a cabinet and took out a slim green bottle its mostly aloe she told him briskly itll help he reached a hand to his face snatched it away again i must have the suns deceptive he managed mrs todd i should tell you i came to the island for the specific purpose of speaking to you yes she uncapped the bottle im a writer he began ive followed your story first i want you to know how much i admire you do you mr harding yes yes indeed something wanted to crawl up from his belly to his throat he forced it down again initially i was merely interested in the story for a magazine piece but as i learned more i realized the value of what you experienced what you did it speaks to so many people im sure you know how many women are caught in the cycle of abuse he continued as she dabbed the balm on her fingers youre a beacon mrs todd a symbol of victory and empowerment no im not mr harding but you are he looked deep into her eyes they were so blue so calm the cramps in his gut eased i followed your trail across the country really she replied then her coated fingers slid over his burned cheek i spoke with people you worked with stepped in your footprints so to speak i know what you did how hard you worked how frightened you were you never gave up and i never will she said clearly you should understand that prepare for that ill never give up you belong to me why do you make me hurt you helen it was evans voice that quiet reasonable voice he used before he punished her terror wanted to burst free but it was terror she knew that it wanted you cant hurt me any longer i will never allow anyone i love to be harmed by you his skin rippled under her fingers as if something crawled there but she continued to smooth on the balm he shuddered once gripped her wrist run he whispered get away before its too late this is my home she fought her fear ill protect it with all that i am well beat you he shuddered again what did you say i said you should go rest now mr harding she capped the bottle as pity for him welled up inside her i hope youll feel better soon you let him go ripley paced the station house tugging at her hair in frustration just patted him on the head and told him to take a nap ripley zacks voice held a quiet warning but she shook her head for christs sake zack think the mans dangerous she said herself she sensed something in him its not his fault nell began but ripley whirled to face her this isnt about fault its about reality even if he were just some reporter with delusions of grandeur that would be bad enough he came here looking for you he followed your path all across the damn country talking to people behind your back thats his job nell held up a hand before ripley could snap at her again a year before she would have backed away from the confrontation times had changed im not going to blame him for doing his job or for whats happening to him now he doesnt know whats happening and hes sick hes frightened you didnt see him ripley i did no i didnt see him because you didnt call me you didnt bring me in is that the real problem i didnt ask you for advice for help nell tilted her head tell me would you have called me or mia ripley opened her mouth then shut it again in one hard thin line were not talking about me maybe we are maybe were talking about all of this its a cycle after all what started it is inside us whats inside us will end it he was hurt she said appealing to zack now confused afraid he doesnt know whats going on do you know zack asked her im not sure theres a power and its dark its using him and i think it was hard to say it hard to think it im afraid its using evan like a bridge from wherever it is through evan to this poor man we need to help him we need to get him off the island ripley interrupted we need to get his ass on the next ferry to the mainland and it doesnt take magic to do that he hasnt done anything rip zack reminded her he hasnt broken any law made any threats weve got no right to order him off the island she slapped her palms on his desk leaned forward hell come after her hell have to he wont get near her i wont let it happen she spun back to nell hell destroy what you love its his reason for being now nell shook her head i wont let him she reached for ripleys hand we wont let him ive felt what he is and what hes capable of ive felt it in me i know nells fingers linked with hers we need mia youre right ripley agreed and i hate that youre a fascinating woman little sister mia leaned on the kitchen counter and watched nell slide pasta into boiling water a crisis is upon us an event that has been brewing for three centuries ripley frets and curses and you cook and serve we all do what we do best she glanced up as she gave the pasta a quick stir what do you do mia i wait no its not as simple as that i prepare then mia lifted her wineglass sipped for whatever comes did you see this whats coming not specifically only something strong something blighted something that formed from blood and vengeance it craves what birthed it she said and grows as it feeds it uses weakness then we wont be weak it underestimates us mia continued we should take care not to underestimate it evil doesnt concern itself with rules with whats right and fair and its clever it can twist itself into the desirable were together now the three of us i have zack and ripley has mac i wish dont wish for me i have what i need mia trying to find the right words nell got out her colander even if when we face whats here now theres one more step yours do you think ill fling myself off my cliffs mia relaxed enough to laugh i can promise you i wont i enjoy living entirely too much there were other ways nell thought to leap into a void she started to say so then held her tongue they had enough to deal with for now what was wrong with them ripley listened to the conversation hum around the table spiced with the scent of good food well served everyday words in easy voices pass the salt jesus it felt as if something was simmering inside her right on the edge of boil ready to bubble up and spew over the lid and everyone else kept chatting and eating as if it were just another evening a part of her knew it was only a lull that space of time used to gather forces and brace but she had no patience with it with nells utter calm with mias cool waiting her own brother helped himself to another serving of pasta as if everything in his life that mattered wasnt teetering on the brink and mac observing absorbing assessing she thought with a helpless resentment a geek to the last there was something hungry out there something that wouldnt be sated with a tidy homecooked meal couldnt they feel it it wanted blood blood and bone death and anguish it craved sorrow and its need clawed at her this blows she shoved at her plate and conversation snapped off were just sitting here slurping up noodles this isnt a goddamn party there are a lot of ways to prepare for a confrontation mac began and laid a hand on her arm she wanted to slap his hand away and hated herself for it confrontation this is a battle a lot of ways to prepare he said again coming together like this sharing a meal a symbol of life and unity its past time for symbols we need to do something definite anger only feeds it mia chimed in then it should be full to bursting ripley snapped back and shoved to her feet because i am supremely pissed off hate anger a thirst for violence mia brought the glass of wine to her lips all those negative emotions strengthen it weaken you dont tell me what to feel could i ever you want what youve always wanted a clear answer when you dont get it you pound with your fists or turn away dont nell pleaded we cant turn on each other now right lets keep the peace ripley heard the bite in her own voice and even while it shamed her she couldnt soften it why dont we have coffee and cake thats enough rip its not enough frustrated beyond bearing she rounded on zack nothings enough until this is dealt with until its over itll be more than a knife to her throat this time more than a knife already coated with your blood i wont lose what i love i wont just sit here and wait for it to come after us on that we can agree mia set down her glass we wont lose and since arguing is bad for the digestion why dont we get to work she rose began to clear the table nell will feel better she said before ripley could make some snide comment if her house is put in order fine great she snatched up her plate lets be tidy she sailed into the kitchen and gave herself points for not simply heaving her plate into the sink what control what amazing restraint god she wanted to scream it was mac who came in quietly behind her alone he set the dishes on the counter then just turned her put his hands on her stiff and rigid shoulders youre afraid he shook his head before she could speak we all are but you feel that the weight of this what happens next is on you it doesnt have to be dont placate me mac i know when im being a bitch good then i dont have to point that out do i were going to get through this you dont feel what i feel you cant no i cant but i love you ripley with everything thats in me so i know and thats the next thing to feeling she let herself give just for a minute let herself go into his arms and be held there safe within the circle of him itd be easier if wed found this after his cheek rubbed her hair you think you couldve come along when everything was normal again and wedve gotten mushy on each other and had a regular life cookouts marital spats great sex and dental bills is that what you want right this minute it sounds aces id rather be mad than scared i work better that way just remember it all comes down to this he tipped back her head laid his lips on hers right there is more magic than most people ever know dont give up on me okay not a chance she tried to curb her impatience as the preparations were made she refused to lie down on the couch because it made her feel too vulnerable instead she sat in a chair in the living room her hands on the arms and blocked out the monitors and cameras she knew she should have felt comforted by having mia and nell standing on either side of her like sentinels but she felt foolish just do it she told mac you need to relax hed pulled a chair up to face hers and sat there almost idly holding the pendant breathe slow in and out he put her under so effortlessly this time so swiftly it brought him a quick ripple of nerves shes tuned to you mia said herself surprised at how completely ripley had given herself over and you to her that itself is a kind of strength they would need it she thought as she felt something cold shiver along her skin in response to it she stretched out her arm and across ripley clasped nells hand we are the three she said clearly and two guard the one while we are joined no harm can be done as warmth seeped back she nodded to mac youre safe here ripley nothing can harm you here its close she said with a shudder its cold and tired of waiting her eyes opened stared blindly into macs it knows you watched you and waited you share the blood youll die through me thats what it wants death to power and power to destruction through my hand grief ground down to her bones stop me her head fell back her eyes rolled back white i am earth she changed even as they watched her hair springing into curls her features subtly rounding my sin must be atoned and the time grows short sister to sister and love to love the storm is coming and with it the dark i am powerless i am lost great tears spilled down her cheeks sister mia laid her free hand on ripleys shoulder and felt the cold again what can we do the eyes that focused on mia werent ripleys they seemed ancient and unbearably sad what you will what you know what you believe trust is one justice makes two and love without boundaries makes three you are the three be stronger than what made you or all is for nothing should you live your heart will break again will you face that ill live and guard my heart she thought the same i loved her loved them both too much or not enough ive yet to see may your circle be stronger and hold tell us how to hold i cannot if the answers live inside you the questions wont matter she turned to nell then you found yours so there is hope blessed be ripley gasped again and came back in the storm she said as the first flash of lightning burst blue light into the room a lamp crashed to the floor a vase of nells flowers spun into the air to hurl itself against the wall the sofa upended itself then shot across the room even as zack whirled toward nell a table tumbled into his path he leaped it cursing and gripping her used his body to shield hers stop mia called into the wind that had gushed into the room nell stay with me she tightened her hold on nells hand used her other to take ripleys limp one still the power and quiet the air challenge this circle he who dares here we stand we are the three as we will so mote it be will pressed against will magic thrummed against magic then as abruptly as it had begun the wind died books that had been spinning in the air fell to the floor with a thud ripley macs voice remained utterly calm in direct opposition to his speeding heart im going to count back from ten youre going to wake up when i reach one slowly he leaned close to her brushed his lips over her cheeks and whispered the magic hed read in the journal youll remember that he promised her hoping it would stay in her mind when she needed it most youll hear that youll know that she felt herself rising as he brought her back as if waking from a hill of feathers the closer she came to the top the more she began to feel the cold and the dread when her eyes were open and her vision clear she saw the blood on macs face it trickled down his forehead down his cheek god my god its nothing he hadnt realized he was cut until she touched her hand to his face and brought it back smeared with blood some flying glass its nothing he repeated a couple of scratches your blood she fisted her hand over it felt the guilt the power the hunger and the fear ive done worse shaving look at me relax nell maybe you could get ripley a glass of water well take a little break here before we talk about all this no ripley snapped as she rose ill get it i need a minute she touched his face lightly im sorry i couldnt control it im sorry its all right she nodded as though she agreed with him but she knew as she walked back toward the kitchen that it wasnt wouldnt be couldnt be she knew what she had to do what had to be done his blood was already cool on her fingers as she walked out the back door and into the rising storm twenty she stepped out into the wind with only one clear purpose she would get harding and herself off the island away from mac away from nell and mia and her brother after that she would do whatever came next but the most immediate danger to those she loved was inside her and linked to whatever was inside harding she had shed macs blood she curled her fingers still damp with it into a fist again blood was power one of its most elemental sources the darker magics used it as a conduit or fed on it everything she was and believed rejected that refused it refuted it do no harm she thought she would try to do no harm but first she would see to it she would ensure that no harm could or would be done to those she loved the murdered innocents it was a whisper in her ear so clear so urgent she spun around expecting to see someone standing behind her but there was nothing but the night the dark and the bright and brutal force of the storm the farther she got from the house the more violent the storm raged and the more her anger grew it would use her to hurt mac to get to nell to destroy mia she would die first and take it with her when she reached the beach she quickened her pace then whirled around at the sound behind her lucy bolted out of the dark ears alert she nearly sent the dog back home with one abrupt command but ripley lowered the arm she had lifted to point and hissed out a breath all right then come along might as well have a goofy dog as a familiar as none at all she rested her hand on lucys head protect whats mine her hair flew in the wind as she and the dog jogged across the sand the surf pounded a wall of black water that slammed relentlessly against the shore the sound of it beat in her head her sister was dead slain like a lamb for her love for her heart for her gift where was the justice the air itself was full of howls and screams a thousand tormented voices under her feet a dirty fog began to creep along the ground rising until it was up to her ankles then halfway to her knees the chill of it seeped into her bones blood for blood life for life power for power how could she have believed there was any other way something made her look over her shoulder where the house should have been with its lights glowing against the window was nothing but a curtain of dirty white shed been cut off from home and she could see now as the fog continued to rise and swirl and thicken from the village as well fine and good she thought shoving fear down beneath fury come on then you bastard she shouted it and her voice cut through the fog like a scalpel through gauze take me on the first punch of power knocked her back a full three steps before she dug in rage curled inside her as she threw up her arms embraced it lightning slashed the sky and sea like redtipped whips ah here she thought here was magic with muscle she saw herself and not herself standing in the gale gathering forces air earth fire water beside her lucy lifted her head and let out a long ululant howl harding or what had mastered him stepped out of the fog rip always did throw a good tantrum zack said to try to lighten the mood the living room was in shambles and if he let himself he could still feel the buzz of what had whipped through it sting along his skin fear and anger anger and fear mia paced as she spoke i couldnt get through it ripleys and the one she comes from its so strong so thick like her skull mac said with a faint grin precisely id hoped to see what tactic would be taken next so that we could counter it that naturally would be too simple this hurts her nell commented i know it does mia patted nells arm absently and im sorry for it the thing to do now is to sit down and figure out how to use those emotions their negativity in what comes next a protective spell at this point is only a stopgap as much as i hate to agree with the deputy we have to take action she stopped to gather her thoughts you havent had much experience nell and it wouldnt be an easy matter in any case what wouldnt mac asked youre thinking of a casting out so handy to have a scholar around yes mia continued there are five of us wed do better with twelve but there isnt time to round up recruits just as there isnt time to do much in preparation well use what weve got once weve she trailed off and her cheeks went deathly pale shes gone shes outside the protective boundary fear leaped out of her before she could cage it shes broken the circle even as mac rushed for the door mia grabbed his arm no no think feelings not enough which is her problem we go together her gaze swept the room and we go ready do you know how its done mac struggled against panic in theory mia watched zack snap on his holster she wanted to tell him that wasnt the way but the expression on his face warned her not to bother tell us what to do nell said urgently and lets do it quickly ripley planted her feet legs spread body braced it was a dare and she knew it draw him out she thought draw him to her and save the rest and destroy him beside her lucy growled low in her throat harding she frosted her voice with amused derision middleaged paunchy city boy not such a keen choice if you ask me a useful shell the voice was deeper and somehow wetter than it should have been weve met before he told her have we i only remember interesting people whats in you remembers whats in me he circled her light on his feet ripley turned with him careful to keep facetoface she slid her fingers into lucys collar to hold her in place as the dog leaped and snapped you reached for what i have once took it into you like a lover remember the ecstasy it was not she discovered a question but a command a fast pulsing thrill pumped through her heady and full glorious a kind of fullbody orgasm that nearly brought her to her knees with its sheer and ferocious pleasure she shuddered from it didnt quite bite back a moan yes god yes she could have this such a thing would be worth any price betrayal damnation death as she struggled to clear her head she caught the flash of movement she stumbled to counter and ended up sprawled on her face in the frigid sand it felt as though shed been rammed by a truck he was chuckling a kind of tickled delight as she shoved to her hands and knees she watched lucy charge leap teeth bared and slam into a shield of air that went flaming at the edges at impact no lucy no hold i can give you what you want and more but it wont be free not free yet easy why dont you take my hand she had her breath back barely held a hand out for the dog that trembled with each growl why dont you kiss my ass he knocked her flat again one wicked sweep of wind i could crush you such a waste join your power with mine and wed rule liar she thought he lies and hes toying with you be smarter she told herself be meaner im confused she said weakly i cant think i need to know the people i love are safe of course he crooned it whatever you want can be yours give me what you are she kept her head down as she got slowly to her feet as if with great effort it was her mind she shot at him when she tossed her head back all the fury of it it was shock she saw on his face for one gratifying instant then his body flew back hurled by her temper the sand where he landed turned black beneath the fog as if scorched im going to send you to hell she promised him the light was blinding and heat and cold burst in the air like shrapnel she went on pure instinct leaping away countering attacking she felt pain bright and stunning and used it as she would a weapon you and yours will suffer he told her there will be agony then there will be nothing which is worse than agony what you love will cease to be you cant touch what i love until you get through me no she could hear his breathing ragged strained he was tiring she thought darkly she would win and even as she gathered herself to end it he clasped his hands raised them black lightning spewed out of the churning sky pierced his joined hands and formed a glinting sword he sliced it once through the air then twice his face was triumphant as he came toward her she called to the earth felt it tremble lightly as it began to quake lucy leaped to defend her even as ripley screamed the sword bit everything you love he said as the dog lay still on the ground everything dies tonight for that alone she threw her hand skyward and her power with it ill kill you she felt the hasp of the sword in her hand the fit true as a glove the weight familiar she swept it down and the clash of blade to blade rang like doom now it was she who called the storm a hundred bolts that lanced the sand and water until they circled like fiery bars and caged them its rage and violence fueled her became her her hate grew with an appetite so greedy it swallowed all else you killed the innocents he was grinning lips peeled back every one you destroyed my sisters they died weeping you murdered the man i loved then and now the thirst for his blood burned in her throat seemed to feed her with impossible strength she beat him back back toward those flaming bars dimly she heard someone calling her in her mind in her ears she blocked it out as she continued to hack and thrust as she felt his sword tremble and give a bit more each time she wanted nothing nothing so much as the glory of running her blade through his heart and feeling the power sing through her at that murderous stroke it coursed through her a little deeper a little truer every moment closer she thought so much closer she could taste the promise of it dark bitter seductive when his sword spun out of his hand and he fell at her feet she felt the thrill of it like sex with the hilt of her sword gripped in both hands she raised it high over her head ripley macs voice was so quiet through the roaring in her head that she barely heard it but her hands trembled its what he wants dont give him what he wants i want justice she shouted as her hair flew around her head in coils and snaps youre too weak to kill me the man at her feet lay back deliberately exposing his throat you havent the courage stay with me ripley look at me with the sword gripped in her hands she stared through the bars she saw mac only inches away where did he come from she thought dully how did he get here beside him stood her brother and on either side mia and nell she heard the wheeze and panting of her own breath felt the cold sweat sliding over her skin and the pulse of that greed swimming in her veins i love you stay with me mac said again remember lower the barrier mias voice was brisk and cast the circle were stronger theyll die the thing with hardings face taunted her ill kill them slowly painfully so you hear them screaming my death or theirs choose she turned away from those she loved and met her match oh yours the night exploded with sound as she brought the sword down a thousand images echoed through her mind through them she saw the triumph in his eyes the sheer glee in them an instant later they were baffled and lost and hardings she stopped the blade an inch from his throat help me he whispered it and she saw his skin ripple i will the root of magic is in the heart she began repeating the words mac had put in her subconscious from this the gift of power must start with its light we burn off the dark with its joy we leave our mark to protect and defend to live and to see as i will so mote it be beneath her ready blade harding began to laugh do you think such weak womens spells will hold me ripley tilted her head almost in sympathy yes as will this her mind was clear as glass as she closed her hand over the edge of the blade it sliced into her palm already stained with macs blood against her heart the amulet mac had given her glowed warm and bright his blood she said and my blood mixed now and true she squeezed until drops fell on his skin and he began to yell in rage she thought as she continued wonderful rage poured from the heart they conquer you this is the power that i set free as i will so mote it be bitch whore he bellowed as she stepped back strained to snatch at her to rise snarled when he could do neither her vision was suddenly so incredibly clear hope she realized was blinding bright she vanished the bars of light turned we cant leave harding like this pity for him swarmed into her poor bastard we cast it out mia said they laid out a circle of salt and silver inside it harding spat and howled like an animal and his curses grew more foul his threats more hideous faces shivered across his face as if the bones knit and reknit themselves thunder rolled across the sky in waves as wild as the surf the wind cried piercingly hardings pupils rolled as they ringed him and clasped hands we cast you out dark into dark from here till ever you bear our mark mia focused a small white pentagram scored hardings cheek he howled like a wolf into the void and into the night nell continued out of this soul and beyond the light helen i love you youre my wife my world he said in evans voice have pity it was pity she felt but the single tear that slipped down nells cheek was all she could give in this place and in this hour ripley chanted we cast you out and scorn your power we are joined we are the three as we will so mote it be we cast you out mia repeated and each who clasped hands repeated one by one until the words overlapped into a single voice the force of it came like a gale cold and fetid it swirled up a black funnel then spewed into the air and into the sea on the sand harding his face gray but unmarked groaned he needs tending nell said go ahead and take care of him then ripley stepped back immediately the strength went out of her legs and she buckled okay baby okay mac caught her lowering her gently to her knees catch your breath clear your head im all right just a bit wobbly she managed to lift her head look at her brother guess you wont have to lock me up for homicide guess not he knelt as well took her face in his hands scared me rip yeah me too she pressed her lips together to keep them from trembling were going to be busy tomorrow storm damage well handle it todds take care of the sisters damn right she breathed in breathed out and felt free you ought to give nell a hand with harding poor sap im okay you always were he kissed both her cheeks held on for another minute then looked at mac as he got to his feet make sure she stays that way she drew in another breath give me a minute will you she asked mac i can probably spare two but not much more okay she agreed as he helped her up her knees were jelly but she willed them to hold her steadied herself and turned toward mia then she forgot the weakness the shock even the echoes of power mia stood smiling just a little one hand on lucys head the dogs tail was wagging like a madcap metronome lucy in one leap she had her face buried in the dogs fur i thought she was gone i saw she jerked back and began stroking at lucy searching for the wound it wasnt real mia said quietly his sword was only an illusion a trick of violence to test you he used it to push you to repeat the sin he didnt want your death not yet he wanted your soul and your power ripley squeezed lucy one last time then straightened and turned to mia well he lost didnt he so he did did you know all along pieces mia shook her head not enough to be sure just enough to doubt and worry she held out a hand as nell crossed to them in my heart i knew you wouldnt fail but in my head i wasnt sure youve always been a difficult puzzle for me i might have done it i was mad enough frightened enough but i felt both of you inside i never wanted this she said in a furious whisper you know i never wanted this lifes tough mia said with a shrug you play the cards youre dealt or you fold i knew youd win nell took her injured hand gently uncurled the fingers you need to see to this i will its not bad she pressed her lips together i want the scar she said i need it then slowly nell curled ripleys fingers into a loose fist zack and i are going to take mr harding back to the house for now he needs a hot meal hes shaken up confused but all in all she glanced back to where zack had harding on his feet amazingly unharmed he remembers little lets keep it that way ripley demanded all right lets go back clean the rest of this up she tilted her head up to the sky saw the clouds dissolving and the halo of the moon glowing pure and white storms passing she murmured mia nodded for now ripley opened her mouth looked toward harding again maybe the guys could take harding back give us another minute here all right ill tell zack the wind had gentled to a breeze and the breeze smelled of night and of water ripley waited until the men and the cheerful dog turned toward home with mia and nell she closed the circle they had cast she took her ritual sword that had been real enough and cleansed it the surf foamed up tame now and lovely and dampened her boots when i lifted the sword she began knowing her friends were beside her i wanted blood like a craving bringing it down seemed to take hours she shifted her feet im not big on this vision crap thats your deal mia usually but i saw images i saw mac mac and me my parents my brother i saw the three of us in the forest the way we were last fall i saw nell you had a baby in your arms a baby nells voice went soft dreamy as she pressed a hand to her belly but im not not yet anyway oh boy nell let out a thrilled and baffled laugh oh boy oh boy anyway ripley continued i saw those things and more the three sisters in a dark wood in a circle of light the one who was earth on this very beach in a storm there were so many coming so fast they overlapped but each was perfectly clear and i saw you mia standing on your cliffs on the edge of your cliffs alone and crying there was darkness all around you the kind that came out of harding tonight it wanted you somehow i its always been you most of all even as the chill crept up her spine mia nodded are you telling me to beware very ware i saw something else at the instant i stopped the sword one last flash the three of us in a circle and i knew it was okay what im saying is i know it can be okay if we do what were supposed to do make the right choices you made yours tonight mia reminded her trust me to make mine youre the strongest well well is that a compliment i hear can it okay in the magic stuff youre the strongest what comes at yous going to be the strongest too none of us is alone now nell took mias hand then ripleys were three ripley took mias hand to finish the link yeah witches are us ripley told herself she was doing what needed to be done but that didnt mean she would enjoy it she watched nell soothe and charm harding bolster him with soup and tea she let mia treat and bind her hand and avoided being alone with mac until they left to walk to the yellow cottage we can load up your equipment tonight if you want ill get it tomorrow he answered he didnt touch her he didnt know why but he sensed she wasnt ready for that yet i guess hardings going to write his book after all not the one he might have had in mind but yeah i think nell likes the idea of a book that offers hope to people in an abuse cycle hes barely the worse for wear now that hes exorcised in a manner of speaking can i ask you a technical question i guess it was a beautiful night cool and fresh and clear there was no reason she told herself to be so edgy now how did you know the blood would hold him i dont know exactly hereditary knowledge mac offered and got a shrug maybe that kind of things your bag magic runs through the blood mine she said lifting her hand yours even though its pretty diluted she glanced over when he laughed thats accurate enough she said testily and blood is a transmitter a sacrifice whatever its life no argument he stopped turned at the verge of the trees where the shadows were soft and the moonlight dappled through black branches was that all theres a bond its emotional apart from intellect or logic even from ritual i guess love he waited a beat why cant you say it now youve never seen me like that before she said in a rush everything thats come before has been like kid stuff compared to tonight you were magnificent he watched her eyes widen it was going to be fun he thought to blindside her with statements like that for the next fifty or sixty years did you think that seeing what i did would change what i feel for you no i dont know mac i was nearly seduced maybe when i went out it was with the idea that i could sacrifice myself and dont tell me thats lame ive already figured that out then ill restrain myself good but the farther i got from the house from all of you the more i wanted blood there was a moment more than a moment when i might have turned when i might have grabbed what was offered the power was outrageous huge seductive staggering but you didnt take it no why i wanted me more i wanted you more and i this sounds hokey say it anyway i wanted justice more he laid his hands on her shoulders brushed a kiss over her brow then he lifted her bandaged palm and kissed that too i said you looked magnificent thats accurate too there was a light bursting out of you nothing could have dimmed it and now youre just my girl your girl she snorted please all mine he said and did what hed wanted to do since hed seen her with a shining sword gripped in her hands he lifted her off her feet nearly crushing her in an embrace as his mouth sought hers marry me live with me in the house by the sea oh god mac i love you its better than everything more than everything hell mac she tipped her head back it is everything and were just getting started she laid her head on his shoulder while he stroked her hair brilliant mind tough body generous heart her lips curved as she thought all mine when the power was in me i felt invincible tremendous its like having molten gold running through your veins do you know how i feel right now how even better she lifted her face to his once more so their lips met once more the sound of the sea was a steady heartbeat in the distance the moon sailed white overhead around them the night shimmered with the echoes of magic and was enough
