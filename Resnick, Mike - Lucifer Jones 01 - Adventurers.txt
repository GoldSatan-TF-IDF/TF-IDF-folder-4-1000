resnick adventurers adventures chapter the white goddess i knew a real live vampire it was in africa about seventy years ago and his name was herbie miller he didnt look much like a vampire i suppose walked around in khaki pants that he cut off above the knees and his hair wasnt slicked down or nothing i cant say he was real fond of crosses but daylight didnt bother him none and he had no problems walking over running water except that he couldnt swim and narrow bridges scared the hell out of him i dont know why he should have been so interested in me especially considering that i was a man of the cloth back then but he was when he wasnt trying to nab me in the neck which was pretty difficult inasmuch as poor herbie was barely five feet tall with his boots on he kept coming up with crazy schemes about how i should go to the local hospital not schweitzers but one youve probably never heard of and borrow some blood for which he promised to pay me in pounds or dollars or rupees or whatever else hed gotten off one of his more recent meals you know i think about herbie and some of the others i met and id have to say that even without the animals and i never did see all that many of them anyway except for the time i was an ivory poacher africa was a pretty interesting place to be back then i had my flock and my tabernacle and of course there was herbie who came smackdab between my little business excursions into opium and brothels and there were long schmidt and short schmidt a pair of brothers who became gods and there was capturin clyde calhoun and a batch of others africa was full of colorful folk like that in the old days they called themselves adventurers and explorers and hunters and missionaries but what they mostly were were outcasts they gathered in the civilized cities most of them johannesburg nairobi mombasa pretoria places like that every now and then theyd go out into the bush only bad pulp writers ever called it the jungle after everything from ivory to lost gold mines to halfnaked white priestesses a lot of them found ivory and a few found gold but the only man i ever knew who went into the bush and found himself a white woman was an irishman named burley rourke i met him just a few days after i got off the boat young and hopeful and sporting my first beard due to a series of unfortunate misunderstandings during an informal game of chance i had been invited to inspect the premises of the johannesburg gaol which while tastefully appointed was nevertheless not the temporary residence i would have picked had the choice been mine rourke was lying on a cot in the adjacent cell he was a tall cadaverous man with bushy black eyebrows and an enormous dimple on his chin he had the longest whitest most delicate fingers i had ever seen on a man and since even his fingernails were clean i asked him if he like myself was being incarcerated due to a certain flexibility toward the hard and fast rules of the game he allowed that this was indeed the case and i asked him if his trade was cards or dice neither he said im a doctor specializing in diseases of the gullible thats when i knew we were going to hit it off just fine how about yourself said rourke you look like some kind of preacher man all done up in black like you are indeed i am brother rourke i said with some modesty i dont know how a respectable man like me got involved with all them sinful characters in the first place i suppose i was just following the good lords mandate to consider every man my brother course i never have gotten around to viewing all the women exactly as sisters and what religion do you preach asked rourke one me and the lord worked out betwixt ourselves one afternoon i said actually the way i see it my calling was determined the day i was born we had a little farm outside moline illinois and once i was alive and secure my mother sent my father to the county courthouse to register my name which was to be lucas jones or lucius jones im still not sure which but my father was a man who loved his liquor and by the time he got there he came up with as close an approximation as he was capable at the time which is how i got to be lucifer jones anyway they say that every action has an equal and opposite reaction and i guess toting the name lucifer around made me painfully aware of who i was named after i just naturally kind of gravitated toward the church especially after i saw the size of our poorbox and pretty soon me and god formed sort of a twoman company and i went out and did his business and a pretty good business it was until the day a couple of federal men came around up until then i had always thought that paying income taxes was voluntary like going into the army and such well id have stayed and fought them but the lord says that vengeance is his so i took off down the mississippi one night and hopped the first ship out of new orleans well now said rourke when id told him the story adding only a minimum number of poetic flourishes i do believe were going to be friends saint luke you dont mind if i call you that do you its got a nice downtoearth sound to it brother rourke i allowed in fact now that i roll it around on my tongue i like it more and more i think with your kind permission that ill be having these godless black heathen build me the tabernacle of saint luke once i leave my present vile surroundings that is oh said rourke furrowing up his forehead and tugging at his mustache thats too bad but of course if a mans got the call its a kind of weak call at this moment i said quickly wondering what he had in mind nothing that couldnt be fought off for a couple of months if i was to dig in tooth and nail i gritted my teeth prepared to make the effort and he must of mistook it for a grin because he grinned right back at me he unbuttoned his shirt pocket and unfolded a huge sheet of paper then he dusted it off a bit and passed it through the bars to me ever see one of these he asked i took a quick look and handed it back if its a map to king solomons mines ive seen about twenty if its to the elephants burial ground theyre kind of rare i dont imagine ive seen much more than half a dozen in the week ive been here he chuckled actually its a map to the lost gold mine of the zulus only one ive seen must have been lost a good long time i opined i dont recall ever seeing a zulu wearing anything but leopardclaw necklaces well what do you think asked rourke about the gold mine i asked about the map he was still grinning at me and all of a sudden a great big heavenly revelation smote me right between the eyes and out of courtesy i returned his smile how many do you think we could make i asked well wed have to hunt up some real old paper and figure out what kind of charcoal the natives draw with need about three bob for materials i should think you supplied the map brother rourke i said ill supply the capital ive got a dozen copies of the good book stashed in my hotel room it shouldnt be too hard to sell them theres plenty of widows in town who can find solace in the words of our lord and his prophets fine he said i figure we ought to be able to make up about fifty thats a lot of maps i said we wouldnt want to flood the market he looked shocked that would be immoral im surprised that such a thought would even cross your mind saint luke personally just for proprietys sake i dont think we should sell more than five an hour at least not until we get to pretoria i agreed we consummated our partnership with a solemn handshake burley and i got turned out about a week later and within another week we had made and sold almost two hundred maps accumulating a substantial little nest egg along the way of course the bush was getting a little crowded by then what with a couple hundred of hopeful investors looking for that lost gold mine so we swung north to bechuanaland where we stopped at an occasional outpost and dispensed maps medical care and salvation with equal vigor i began taking contributions to the tabernacle of saint luke and rourke made a little extra pin money by curing two settlers who didnt have heart attacks and another who hadnt broken his leg when he came to a trader who really did have blackwater fever he decided that it was time for us to get moving again now there are a lot of ways for a newlyarrived american and a newlyarrived irishman to travel through africa but foot slogging aint one of them when we werent pulling scorpions out of our clothes and ticks off our skins we spent most of our time starving and getting rained on for what was supposed to be a hot arid country i never did see so much rain in all my life it ruined what was left of the maps but since we had sold about three hundred by that time it didnt seem like such a great loss besides we soon figured out that zulu gold mines werent real high on our itinerary whereas a map to the nearest city would have been a right welcome blessing i remember that one night just before our food was due to run out i fell asleep next to an old termite mound i was still dreaming about an exceptionally nubile daughter of king solomon or perhaps it was king david when burley kicked me in the ribs i took the lords name in vain a couple of times and tried to go back to sleep but then he kicked me again get on your feet saint luke he said weve got company i jumped up right quick at that and peered off in the direction he was looking there were about twenty halfnaked black savages off in the distance all of them carrying spears and shields do you reckon theyre cannibals brother rourke i asked holding up a hand to shade my eyes from the morning sun too far away said rourke i cant see their teeth what have their teeth got to do with it i read somewhere that all cannibals file their teeth he said i remembered some gossip i had heard about old doc peterson back in moline before they locked him away and i knew he sure didnt file his teeth so i kind of discounted that theory but they were getting closer now and most of them looked pretty full so i figured that it wasnt worth worrying about for the time being what do you think we ought to do asked rourke heal em or convert em they dont look like they need much of either i said as they approached to within a hundred yards i dont suppose you know zulu or tswana he shook his head they dont speak much of either back in dublin how about beads im told they go crazy for beads sounds reasonable brother rourke i said i didnt know you had any me of course not dont you have any rosary beads in your pockets wrong religion i replied the savages were about forty yards away now and muttering amongst themselves they had slowed down a bit but were still approaching they look like they mean business said rourke suppose we ought to make a run for it to where i asked we dont even know where we are the way i figure it said rourke cairos north and the capes south take your choice but by then they had split up and a moment later we were surrounded pulling the good book from my pocket i cleared my throat raised my hands above my head and took a step forward brethren i shouted and they all jumped back a couple of steps in the book of herod chapter verse the lord god said unto moses thou shall not eat thy neighbor the leader of the heathens stopped dead in his tracks and blinked his eyes very rapidly youre getting to them said rourke out of the side of his mouth say something else maybe a little hellfire and damnation and the children of israel were wicked i intoned and you know why they were wicked because they ate two wayfarers who had mistakenly wandered into their city for does not jesus say that to err is human but to forgive divine and the children of israel who were dressed a far sight better than you you godless savages were cast out into the desert to wander for forty years do you want that to happen to you you ignorant barbarians oh you got em on the run saint luke said rourke you really got em going well they got going all right but in the wrong direction and a few seconds later the leader was standing so close to me that l could just about smell his breath make him smile said rourke i still want to get a look at his teeth the savage responded with an enormous grin like so he asked in a deep gravelly voice then frowning he extended a forefinger and poked me right in the short ribs you come he jabbed rourke with the butt of his spear you too we acceded to his wishes not caring to dwell upon the alternatives for any considerable length of time they didnt treat us unkindly but then no competent butcher likes to bruise the meat so i cant say that we were real quick to develop a mutual trust with our black companions we walked the better part of a day stopping every now and then for water and privy calls and when night came we built a big fire and huddled around it more from cold than from fear of maneating beasts of which there werent none except maybe for our present company finally the leader walked over to us and sat himself down crosslegged he pointed to himself and said kitunga rourke said burley tapping himself on the chest and this heres saint luke kitunga solemnly extended his hand kind of upside down and shook each of ours does this mean youre not going to eat us asked rourke eat you said kitunga and laughed no no not eat then what do you want from us said rourke chumbichumbi said kitunga sounds like some kind of ritual said rourke what the devil does it mean kitunga flashed every tooth in his head make babies he said he shook our hands again spat in the fire and began walking away hold on a minute i said jumping up what do you mean make babies make babies said kitunga solemnly with the forefinger of one hand and the fist of the other he gave us a graphic and vigorous analogy you mean you want us to make babies with some naked black barbarians i demanded not black said kitunga like you you mean a white woman asked rourke yes yes said kitunga white woman as you can imagine we immediately fell to discussing this development between ourselves while kitunga ambled off to sleep with his men back in those days there were lots of tales making the rounds about white women who were priestesses or goddesses of heathen black tribes but while they sounded good over a lonely campfire or in the bar of the norfolk hotel they were about as likely to be true as our lost zulu gold mine the way i see it brother rourke i said after considerable thought is that these here savages have killed some hunting party except for a white woman whom theyve doubtless got chained to a post in their village and whom they probably ravish by the hour i dont know that im real pleased about this turn of events saint luke said rourke oh ill admit that it beats being eaten but i suppose shes going to want us to rescue her it was a kind of gloomy thought at that and i said as much still i added its the christian thing to do maybe you could tell her to turn the other cheek a fascinating thought in itself said rourke well i suppose wed at least better make sure she wants to be rescued before we go about upsetting kitunga i suggested right agreed rourke a person can get used to anything in time maybe shes gotten to where she likes being ravished a telling point i agreed we fell silent for a while and then an interesting notion hit me brother rourke i said i think weve been looking at this situation all wrong how so he asked why should a bunch of healthy young bucks want our help ravishing a prisoner i hadnt quite gotten around to considering that he admitted now that you mention it it doesnt really make a lot of sense does it it sure as hell dont scientific curiosity maybe he said nope i said i been mulling on it for a couple of minutes now and it seems to me that if they was choosing partners for this white woman theyd just naturally choose themselves makes sense said rourke nodding his head thoughtfully well then it stands to reason that if bringing us back with them aint their idea it must be hers sensible muttered rourke sensible and if shes giving orders to a batch of speartoting heathen like kitunga and his buddies she must be a pretty powerful little lady holy shit exclaimed rourke suddenly an oversexed white priestess he stared up at the clouds which were covering up the stars as usual and got a faraway look on his face golden hair down to her waist he said and breasts like white cantaloupes maybe a bracelet or an armband or two well i couldnt see that the picture he was painting was all that much more enticing than a naked white woman staked out spreadeagled on the ground but i could tell that rourke didnt want to be bothered none so i fell to thinking about what kind of tabernacle me and this white priestess could build right here in the bush before we got around to trading ivory and other such trinkets with civilized folks i didnt know how big her tribe was but if kitungas group was just a foraging party i figured wed have an awful lot of manpower able to respond to a terse command or two as for burley i decided that he wasnt such an allfired bad fellow and id probably let him stick around as a resident witch doctor so long as he didnt impose on our hospitality too often like coming over to dinner of a sunday or asking us to steal a white woman for him too ten minutes later rourke was still drawing verbal pictures in the damp night air by now hed got her hair down to her ankles and her breasts were the size of honeydew melons seems to me that hed done away with her armbands too he just kept whispering to nobody in particular all night and by morning he was busy working out the color of her eyes and how narrow her waist was once the sun came up it got warm enough to start traveling again no matter how hot the days are in africa the nights are enough to convince you that youve wandered into eskimo country by mistake and kitunga gave us each a nonetoogentle nudge with the butt of his spear we began walking mostly over open veldtland but occasionally going through skyhigh grasses on old elephant and rhino trails and i fell to questioning him about the white woman it didnt help much since kitunga had just about run through his entire english vocabulary the day before i couldnt tell how his tribe had come by this woman or what she looked like or if she had been there so long shed forgotten how to speak in a civilized language or even why she felt the need to make babies one thing he did let drop that she was a medicine woman which was probably as close to being a high priestess as a person could get among these heathen so rourke was right on that point at least i figured it was all to the good since once she and i started taking field trips to nairobi and places like that the tribe would need a good medicine man and even if rourke couldnt cure a dysentery germ he could probably talk it to death we walked for two more days i tried to figure out where we were but one tree looks pretty much like another and it was raining so much i never did get a fix on the southern cross or any of the constellations so finally i gave up on it and just followed along when we bedded down that second night kitunga gave us to understand more through gestures than words that we would reach his village the next morning and thats where well meet your witchwoman i asked yes yes he said and then we both move in with her just one said kitunga just one said rourke looking a little upset what happens to the other kitunga shrugged and walked away looks like the winner gets to eat the loser brother rourke i said at last id never eat you no matter what said rourke devoutly i fully agreed with that remark and me and the lord fell to discussing the matter between ourselves trying to figure out how best not to present rourke with any such opportunity on the surface of it there was no problem that i could see what with me being a handsome and vigorous young stallion possessed as i was with the eye of a hawk the heart of a lion and the gentle hand of a lady but women are peculiar creatures in matters of taste and a woman who would send a small battalion of naked warriors out in search of a bed partner was likely to be a little more peculiar than most so having dwelled on the matter for some time i waited until rourke was asleep and borrowed a sharp hunting knife from kitunga then i walked to a nearby river cut off my beard and shaved as close as i could and washed out all my clothes on the way back i passed a pile of elephant dung which had been sitting there for some days picked some up and carefully smeared it over rourkes shirt and pants as he slept i couldnt be sure hed accept it in the sporting manner in which it was done so i wandered over to where kitungas boys were sleeping and piled in with them one of them spent half the night grabbing at my ass and giggling but i awoke whole and in one piece matter of fact what woke me up was rourke screaming at the top of his lungs hed flung off all his clothes except for his boots and was jumping up and down in a right impressive fit of rage his eyes fell on me and he pointed an accusing finger in my direction you did it you judas he screamed you son of a bitch you want her all to yourself you did it calm yourself brother rourke i said stepping forward but still keeping a couple of warriors between him and me i dont know quite what youre talking about damn your hide he screamed you know bloody well what im talking about mark my words you sure as hell arent going to have her not without one whopping big fight i just looked at kitunga and shrugged he grinned and motioned his men to get moving go now he said now just a goddamned minute snapped rourke ive got to clean up first kitunga walked over and pointed the business end of his spear at him go now he said rourkes shoulders sagged he paused just long enough to transfer his money from his pants pocket into his boot and started walking off with us he made a pretty comical picture walking through the bush six and a half feet tall skinny as a rail and wearing nothing but his beatup old hunting boots but i thought it safer to admire him from afar and always kept half a dozen men between us in about two hours we reached the top of a hill and looking down i could see a batch of thorn huts sitting beside a stream that ran through a large valley i adjusted my jacket buttoned my shirt up to the collar tried to comb my hair a bit with my fingers and turned to kitunga whats her name i asked neeyora he said it had a lovely lilt to it just the kind of name that ought to go with being a gorgeous priestess among these godless savages and i started marching down the hill to the valley so as not to prolong rourkes agony any more than was strictly necessary when i got within about a hundred yards of the village i stopped right suddenlike and blinked my eyes once or twice then i looked ahead again to make sure it was no mirage brother rourke l said he stopped in his tracks and just glared at me without answering i done a terrible thing this morning a wickedly sinful thing and i want to make amends if youd like my clothes all except for my hat which i need to shield me from the heat and the rain ill gladly turn them over to you right now what the hell are you talking about said rourke a totally unwarranted look of suspicion on his face i just dont want the lord looking down with displeasure on me for trying to trick you like i did i said i started unbuttoning my shirt but kitunga pointed his spear right at the middle of my belly and smiling like all getout shook his head vigorously but i just want to give him something to wear i said no no he said prodding my belly with the point of his spear blade whats this all about demanded rourke walking over you were right about her being blonde i said but you were a little on the conservative side about her breasts what do you mean said rourke looking suspicious not honeydew melons brother rourke i said with a sigh watermelons he shaded his eyes and looked toward the village there sitting in front of the largest hut was our halfnaked white priestess more to the point she was about ninetyfive percent naked it would have taken the hide of a small elephant to cover half of her her hair was blonde under the dirt and the grease even as we approached i couldnt tell what color her eyes were they were sunken too far beneath the folds of flab to even tell if she had any her shoulder spread would have done a bull gorilla proud and her breasts which sagged down well below her waist could have given sustenance to an army she was sitting in the mud rolling bones and the driedout carcasses of small lizards on the ground in front of her it looked like she was trying to sit cross legged but her legs were too fat to bend rourke had been wrong about the bracelet too i dont think they could have made one big enough to fit her that gasped rourke thats neeyora kitunga nodded rourke turned to me grinning i dont know how to thank you saint luke his eyes darted over the ground you dont see any more elephant shit do you then he began laughing and threw a dungcovered arm around my shoulders well let bygones be bygones he said and began walking up to neeyoras hut father why hast thou forsaken me i muttered and allowed myself to be led into the village neeyora looked up and if she was less than desirable in repose she was absolutely mindboggling in animation she grinned from ear to ear a pretty fair distance given the size of her face said something i couldnt understand to kitunga and began licking her lips two of the villagers helped her slowly to her feet and she approached us giggling like a crazy woman her tiny little eyes now that i was close enough i could see that they were red darted from one of us to the other she reached out and pinched my upper arm and rourke just stood there laughing like a lunatic then she walked over to the irishman who was every bit as dirty and foulsmelling and naked as she was and it was love at first sight she gave a jubilant little scream threw her arms around him which practically made the bottom threequarters of him vanish from sight and began dragging him off to her hut dont just stand there luke hollered rourke do something if id had my mouth organ with me i suppose i could have played here comes the bride but under the current circumstances i thought it best to keep a low profile so other than offering brother rourke a few appropriate quotes on love and marriage from the good book i just smiled and waved goodbye to him as he vanished into the darkened recesses of his bridal bower a high pitched shriek a couple of minutes later gave me to understand that he had also vanished into the darkened recesses of his bride well kitunga and i and the boys wandered over to one of the huts and started drinking some homebrewed beer and swapping tall stories i didnt understand a word they said and i dont imagine they understood me either but what with the beer and all we became pretty fast friends by the time rourke staggered out of his hut a couple of hours later i dont think job at his lowest could have looked any worse all the fire had gone out of his eyes and he looked kind of shrunken he collapsed next to me and i handed him a cup of native brew he drank it without a word i turned to kitunga now that hes made the babies can we go that tickled kitungas funnybone for some reason and he emitted a roar of laughter this was a little unsettling for i still didnt know exactly what happened to unsuccessful suitors rourke looked like he wouldnt have the energy to leave anyway so i decided to let the subject drop for the moment we sat there swigging beer and singing songs for a little while longer and then i heard a deep voice bellow rerrk oh god not again muttered rourke rerrk hollered neeyora sounding just a little louder than a bull elephant in musth rourke reached into his boot and pulled out his share of our money which was about three hundred british pounds take it he said its all yours if you ever get back to civilization ill organize a party and come back here for you i promised crossing a couple of fingers behind my back he laughed weakly ill never last that long no what i want you to do is buy a headstone for me and plant it in the graveyard at johannesburg if theres any money left i assured him there would be and made a solemn vow to see to it walk into the nearest bar and buy a round for everyone in the house and drink to my memory you sure you wouldnt rather have your name engraved on a pew in my tabernacle i asked thoughtfully just do what i said whispered rourke rerrk two of kitungas men helped rourke to his feet and led him back to his blushing bride while he was gone the rest of us got down to serious drinking i quietly suggested to the lord that now might be an admirable time for him to give me the strength of ten men because my heart was pure and sure enough i was the only one who didnt pass out in the next hour i quietly filled my canteen with one last batch of brew and walked on out of the village just as free as a bird when i reached the top of the hill i paused to take one last look partly out of sentiment but mostly to make sure that no one was pursuing me yet there wasnt a sign of life in the whole village then i saw a figure crawl out of a hut and start making toward the beer and a few seconds later i heard a truly ear splitting scream of rerrk and that was the last i ever saw of burley rourke and his white priestess chapter partners i wandered north and east fell in for a while with a canadian named pinder who was singlehandedly drinking his way from the cape to cairo made it to the railhead in uganda and took the train all the way to mombasa on the coast where i had the bad fortune to run into three different parties i had sold maps to they failed totally to see the humor in the situation or to realize that their donations had gone to a worthy cause and discretion being the better part of valor i took a vigorous stroll to the south and wound up in daressalaam which was the capital of tanganyika daressalaam wasnt like any other town in british east it was on the ocean but wasnt much of a seaport it was in africa but there was nothing bigger or more ferocious than a goat within thirty miles it was a capital but it couldnt have held six buildings that could resist a strong wind it was composed in almost equal parts of east indians black africans and reprobates from all over the world i felt right at home i took a room at the only hotel in town shaved and showered had a big dinner and went to maurices a bar down by the waterfront sometime around midnight i found myself in the back room betting on scorpion races and the lord being on my side i wound up the night with about two thousand pounds in winnings when i returned to my room i found a man sitting down on one of the chairs there he was tall though nowhere near as tall as rourke with piercing gray eyes and a neatly trimmed little goatee he was dressed all in black hat shirt tie vest jacket belt pants socks shoes in point of fact he made my preaching clothes look like an outfit of gossamer gaiety begging your pardon brother i said but aint you in the wrong room i hardly think so he said in a voice so slick and cultured you could have used it for cooking oil allow me to introduce myself my name is dobbins major theodore dobbins late of his majestys armed forces he handed me his card which was just a little frayed around the edges and was black with white lettering on it i extended my hand the right reverend doctor jones at your service i said well my dear doctor jones he said pulling out a cigarette and putting it into a motherofpearl holder i shant beat about the bush i have come to you because i am in need of your help im always happy to help a soul in need major i said sitting down on the edge of the bed of course you understand that spiritual aid and comfort does get a little expensive at this time of night it is not spiritual aid that i seek sir he said with a dry chuckle indeed it is not i am given to understand that you came into possession of a considerable amount of money earlier this evening is this not correct the good lord saw fit to smile upon me i admitted excellent he was positively beaming now while puffing away at his cigarette then i am in the position to suggest a brief alliance which may work to our mutual benefit involving as it does a pooling of resources this money is being held in escrow for the tabernacle of saint luke i replied with dignity then i thought about it and added however to be perfectly honest construction aint due to begin for another few months when the rainy season ends and i imagine my parishioners wouldnt be averse to an extremely conservative shortterm investment i understand perfectly my dear sir he said with a smile even his teeth looked oily i deal in commodities doctor jones many of these are in the form of highly perishable goods imported from the fields of far exotic china such a shipment is currently aboard a vessel anchored not five hundred yards from us he paused to light another cigarette may i presume that you fully comprehend my position i think were on the same wave length i allowed well then you can imagine my dismay when i discovered that my associate who was on his way here from marrakech was waylaid and murdered by a band of arab slave traders my goods are in the harbor my principals await their delivery in the mediterranean my caravan has been hired yet i am temporarily unable to set the wheels of industry in motion the entire enterprise has ground to a halt for lack of the necessary capital worse yet my competitors knowing that something has gone amiss are waiting like jackals at the kill in brief sir i must have no less than seventeen hundred british pounds the return on your investment within a mere matter of days will be tenfold whats the nature of your competition i asked he waved a hand vaguely as if shooing a fly away men of little breeding and less ethics hardly worthy of notice except for this unfortunate turn of affairs one of them is actually a trafficker in human flesh not godfearing gentlemen like us my dear doctor jones he said shaking my hand warmly we understand one another completely may i assume that we are partners ill have to spend the night in prayer conferring with the lord and getting his advice on the subject i said suppose i meet you for dinner at maurices tomorrow night and give you my decision at that time certainly he said rising and walking to the door just before he left he turned and said remember my dear sir that god helps those who help themselves that sentiment aint never far from my mind i assured him after he left i settled down to thinking seriously about the majors proposal i felt certain that understanding my goals as he did the lord wouldnt mind my entering into this little enterprise just the same as my silent partner i knew that hed want me to look into all aspects of it very carefully for example it stood to reason that if the goods were still aboard the ship the majors competition also lacked the necessary funding and while a thousand percent profit was a healthy return on my investment i could build my tabernacle a lot quicker with a two thousand percent return therefore just before i fell asleep i made up my mind to see if i couldnt hunt up the majors rivals as it turned out i didnt have to do much in the way of hunting at all i was sitting at my table on the hotels veranda the next morning drinking my coffee and waiting for some ostrich eggs and toast when a stout gentleman dressed in a soiled white suit walked up and seated himself opposite me his hair was so thin that his skull shone through in half a hundred places all red and covered with sweat which ran down his face in little rivulets until it got caught up in his beard doctor jones he said pulling out a handkerchief and mopping his forehead he had an accent i couldnt quite place the right reverend doctor jones i acknowledged sipping my coffee it has come to my attention that you had a visitor last night ive nothing to hide brother i said i met with major theodore dobbins late of his majestys armed forces he laughed until he was courtmartialed for embezzling he said i assume he put forth a proposition to you that he did his eyes narrowed slightly i hope you were not so impetuous as to enter into any business agreement with him caution is my middle name brother i said im still mulling over his offer good he said you had a very narrow escape doctor jones you cannot begin to know the nature of the man with whom you were speaking true i agreed on the other hand i do know his name forgive me he said wiping his head again i am known as the dutchman just the dutchman he nodded i do have a large variety of business names he added helpfully if using one of them would make you more comfortable not at all i said pouring another cup of coffee then i looked up at him quickly you wouldnt happen to be a slave trader would you he sat up erect and said i prefer to think of myself as the director of an international occupational placement service i signaled to the waiter wont you join me for breakfast dutchman i have a feeling that weve got a lot to talk about just coffee thank you he said the waiter brought a large pot and left it on the table the dutchman poured himself half a cup waved away my offer of cream and sugar and withdrew a small flask from his coat pocket pouring a generous amount into the cup and stirring it vigorously doctor jones he said after taking a mansized swallow and screwing up his face may i speak frankly with you well it might make a pleasant change i answered i am in need of a certain amount of venture capital fourteen hundred pounds to be exact you won considerably more than that last night i would like to arrange a shortterm loan have you considered a bank i asked yes i have he replied but the bank at daressalaam is well fortified and would be most difficult to break into i assume that your credit rating would make a more forthright approach out of the question he nodded vigorously there must be a prejudice against hollanders in tanganyika i can conceive of no other reason for it at any rate will you consider such a transaction jesus only threw the moneylenders out of the temple i said with a smile i dont recall the good book making any reference to throwing them out of daressalaam then may i assume that we have a deal said the dutchman well now thats putting the cart just a little bit ahead of the horse i said what interest would you be expecting to pay shall we say one thousand percent for ten days well thats a right round number i said all them zeroes and everything a very pretty number indeed good exclaimed the dutchman shall we draw up a contract right away of course fifteen hundred is just as pretty i continued i think there ought to be a five in there somewhere always liked fives ever since i was a toddler and i suppose two zeroes is just as good as three reminds me more of one of solomons wives that way such a figure is out of the question snapped the dutchman i know that our mutual friend couldnt have offered you that much what he offered me dutchman i said is a matter known only to him me and the lord i shall have to speak to my investors said the dutchman thats perfectly understandable i replied i think a short session of prayer might help you to come to a decision i will meet again with you tonight he said finishing his coffee and rising ill be at maurices most of the evening i said im meeting major dobbins there for dinner make no commitment until you hear from me said the dutchman and remember that i sell merchandise of all colors well i didnt know if that was a threat or an offer so i just smiled at him and watched him waddle away then i dug into breakfast with a vengeance after which i walked to the harbor i figured the goods would be in a rustcovered seedylooking scow but there were so many of them there that i knew right away that id never be able to spot the one that had brought saint lukes tabernacle this little windfall as i was walking back to my hotel i noticed a small olive colored man following me he was sneaking in and out of shadows just like a reallife spy except that he was so clumsy about it that he damned near went through a couple of plateglass windows trying to jump out of my line of vision just to make certain it was me he was after i took a walk through the arab quarter and sure enough he was still about two hundred feet behind me half an hour later it being a hot day and the air being as thick as salt water i finally took pity on him turned in my tracks and walked right up to him as i approached he looked so scared that i thought he was going to faint dead away hut he settled for gulping twice and sweating a lot good afternoon brother i said cheerfully would it be easier on you if i just found a nice shady bench and sat down on it he nodded cat got your tongue i asked most assuredly not he said in a high nasal voice or is that an american colloquialism no its just slang i said lets rid ourselves of the formalities the right reverend doctor jones at your service i extended my hand and he looked so startled that i thought he was going to jump clear up to the moon and i am henri pasquard he said when hed stopped shaking cant say that ive ever heard of you brother i said oh nobody has he said solemnly that is essential to my business but possibly you have heard of le rongeur nope he looked disappointed what does it mean i asked oh nothing much its just my professional name sort of like a stage name for an actor i was about to pat him on the shoulder and tell him not to look so unhappy but i didnt want him to start shaking again so l settled for offering him a cigar oh i dont smoke he said the smell makes me ill then i wont inflict the stench of my tobacco on you i said putting the one i had chosen for myself back into my pocket his hair was all slicked down with grease and the grease and sweat were starting to run down his forehead into his eyes so i offered him a handkerchief he accepted it with a brief murmur of thanks would you care to tell me why you were following me brother rongeur i said hoping the use of his professional name would put him more at ease i meant to approach you sooner or later he said staring down at his twotoned shoes but is it not reasonable that i should first see if i could determine where you might have hidden the money reasonable as all getout i agreed and now that you know its not on me and that im not going to lead you to it what next why i should like to propose a partnership of course he said major dobbins is a thief of the lowest type and the dutchman is even worse i should think that dealing with such people would be repugnant to a man of your character whereas dealing with a man like yourself please do not think that i offer you only honesty and integrity he said quickly on the contrary l will return your money threefold in a weeks time ive already had better offers than that i said i have no doubt of it said the little man almost apologetically but what good are their offers once they have their hands on the material i without false modesty can give you a list of references which will satisfy even a man of the cloth i can he broke off suddenly excuse me he said withdrawing an impressivelooking pistol from a shoulder holster and tucking it into his belt i tend to sweat under my arms and moisture ruins the mechanism where were we i believe you were about to list your references i said that would perhaps be indiscreet until such time as i know you are interested in a partnership he said perfectly understandable i said just out of curiosity brother rongeur what exactly do you do when youre not striking up partnerships oh i try to keep busy at one thing or another he said lowering his eyes again and what does le rongeur mean the rodent he said blushing under his olive skin originally i was the weasel but there is no masculine form of it in french it is always la belette it became very embarrassing and attracted an inferior sort of person if you understand my meaning but why rodent or weasel or any kind of animal at all i asked its kind of a private joke he said still blushing furiously care to let me in on it brother rongeur then it wouldnt be private any longer would it he replied besides it really has very little to do with the business at hand have you reached a decision ill have to spend some time weighing all my offers very carefully i said i should be able to come to a decision by tonight i can meet you at oh we neednt make any arrangements doctor jones he interrupted i dont intend to let you out of my sight for the rest of the day oh i dont mean to disturb you but you must understand my position just go on about your business as if i werent here i shall try to be as unobtrusive as possible i thanked him and began walking back to the hotel every now and again id turn back and sure enough there hed be ducking in and out of shadows about fifty feet behind me he was such a skinny little man and i got to feeling so sorry for him that once or twice when i got too far ahead of him id browse at a vendors table and give him a chance to catch up for which he shot me a couple of very grateful smiles i finally got to my room relaxed in the castiron tub for an hour shaved and lay down for a little nap when i woke up it was getting on toward sunset so i changed into my sunday preaching clothes and decided it was time to stroll over to maurices the rodent was waiting for me on the hotel veranda and began following me at a respectful distance maurices was exotic and dirty with about a threetoone ratio in favor of the dirt there were a number of rooms with pretty farfetched doorframes all separated by rows of hanging beads the lighting throughout the place was dim the air was circulated by a couple of very large and slowturning overhead fans and the walls were covered with animal heads tapestries and paintings of very naked ladies i paused in the bar just long enough to stuff a couple of bills in the brassiere of a belly dancer and then walked into one of the smaller back rooms where i found major dobbins late of his majestys armed forces sitting at a table and puffing away at his cigarette holder ah he exclaimed as his gaze fell upon me my dear doctor jones l trust your day went well so far so good i assured him of course it aint over yet true he said his eyes twinkling but any day that begins with a visit from the dutchman cant fail but to get better eh he chortled and poured half a flask of gin into his water glass then stirring it up a little with a dirty coffee spoon he drank it down in a single swallow i know it irritates maurice he confided but i simply cannot tolerate his bar stock and as for his wine cellar he gave a manoftheworld shrug and i nodded in my most sophisticated manner at this moment the rodent walked into our room and sat down at an adjoining table he gave us a nervous little smile and immediately buried his nose in the menu which was kind of strange since the only thing maurice ever served was impala steak you know him i presume said the major nodding in the rodents direction met him this afternoon i said he made you an offer he did you turned him down naturally said the major why naturally anyone could tell just by looking at him that hes a man of weak moral character said the major hardly the kind of person youd care to enter into business with see how he keeps peeking at us over the top of his menu no my dear sir we englishmen have to stick together im an american i pointed out same thing he said shall we get down to details now at just that moment the dutchman walked in and came over to our table im sure you dont mind if i join you he said pulling up a chair he had a different white suit on but it was if anything even more soiled than the last one personally i have no objections whatsoever said the major however my good friend doctor jones is in a hurry to conclude our business it might be best if you returned in an hour or so the dutchman cracked his knuckles and sank even deeper into the tiny wooden chair my friend doctor jones seems to have fallen into a pit of vipers he said at last once i extricate him he will know who his real friends are he paused to light a very bent cigarette by the way what is le rongeur doing at the next table i am trying to decide what to order said the little man with some haughtiness well that takes care of him for the next fortyfive minutes said the dutchman what has this phony offered you doctor jones he said jerking a thumb in the majors face i thought the major might take a swing at him but instead he just laughed jovially and turned to me youve spoken to both of us my good sir he said i put it to you which of us is the more trustworthy i looked from one to the other and to tell the truth i had considerable difficulty making up my mind then suddenly the rodent hissed between his teeth and all eyes turned to the doorway through which stepped a tall wellgroomed white man wearing a police uniform well well what have we here he said with a smile i really should get a photograph of this and title it thieves carnival he turned to me you wouldnt happen to be lucifer jones would you the right reverend doctor jones i replied i thought as much he said i am captain peter clarke at your service sir and the biggest service i can offer you is to urge you not to enter into any transactions with your current companions what makes you think i was considering such a thing brother clarke i asked when youre out in the bush and you see vultures circling in the sky what makes you think theres a carcass on the ground he replied with a smile i assure you doctor jones that the mere presence of these three swindlers is ample proof to anyone who knows them that you are in possession of a tidy piece of change i can only urge you to hang on to it for dear life i did not come here to have my character impugned said the major i can do more than impugn it laughed captain clarke i can document it major theodore dobbins age fortysix dishonorably discharged for embezzlement served three terms for fraud in england one for robbery in australia currently on probation from johannesburg wanted in ethiopia morocco and egypt for drug dealing he turned to the dutchman and this ones another treasure caesare tobur alias winston riles alias hans gerber alias horst brokow alias the dutchman wanted in seven countries for slave trading and in three more for the illegal sale of firearms then why havent you arrested them i asked more out of politeness than a fervent desire to see any potential meal tickets locked away inefficient extradition laws said captain clarke tanganyika was a german protectorate until a few years ago it still takes an enormous amount of paperwork to get things done here besides we dont know which ship is carrying the opium but we do know that someone is going to have to make a move in the next day or so i hope youll forgive my frankness doctor jones but id hate to see you get mixed up with these characters and that little weasel sitting at the next table is the worst of the lot i beg your pardon said the rodent rising to his feet worst butcher in all of british east said captain clarke hes killed something like thirtyfive men thats a lie screamed the rodent he turned to me i put it to you my dear friend i have killed only sixteen men all in selfdefense i have never been convicted of murder there are no warrants for my arrest anywhere in africa and yet this this fou tries to make me sound like a maddog killer me le rongeur who wouldnt harm a fly unless provoked he sneered at clarke thirtyfive men indeed well what do you say doctor jones said captain clarke would you care to have me escort you back to your hotel or possibly put you into protective custody until the deadline for the deal has passed i thank you for your concern brother clarke i said but surrounded as i am by the scum of the earth what better place could i find to do the lords bidding why dont you check back in on me in a couple of hours if youre still alive said clarke grimly ill have em singing hosannahs in half that time i said with a confident smile well i cant force you to use your brain said captain clarke with a shrug he turned and left the room i hope you will accept what he said with a grain of salt said the major obviously misinformed said the dutchman i wonder who killed the other nineteen men mused the rodent a waiter approached us just then and we all ordered impala except the rodent who insisted on having fish the waiter after some argument finally agreed provided that the rodent wouldnt object if his fish looked and tasted like impala the little man finally nodded the waiter left and i was alone with my confederates once again as i was saying began the major you must by now realize what kind of social untouchables have joined us in our repast we have a demented dwarf who cant remember how many men hes killed and a slave trader called the dutchman whos probably never been within two hundred miles of holland hah snapped the dutchman i grew up in rakovnik which happens to be in czechoslovakia said the rodent softly from the next table amsterdam amended the dutchman quickly i grew up in amsterdam its been such a long time that i get confused and what about yourself major i asked did you really serve time in all those prisons a series of unfortunate misunderstandings he said smoothly but let us come back to the point sir i have made you a very generous proposition are we to be partners and i have made him an even better one said the dutchman at any rate said the major i feel certain that we may at least eliminate le rongeur from consideration you cannot possibly entertain the notion of entering into an agreement with such a man as the major finished speaking the rodent made a sudden move with his right hand and i found myself alone at the table both my companions having dropped to the floor with a swiftness born of terror the rodent merely smiled picked his napkin from his lap and dabbed himself about the lips that was a thoroughly uncivil thing to do complained the major getting back onto his chair you would prefer that i let my wine trickle down my chin asked the rodent gently we would prefer that you not make any sudden movements in the direction of your belt said the dutchman huffing and puffing as he regained his feet my apologies gentlemen said the rodent next time i feel the need to reach for anything below the line of your vision i shall first announce what i am reaching for the major nodded vigorously its only good manners i must add said the rodent that if you make any further attempt to convince my good friend doctor jones that i am unable to fulfill my word as an independent businessman the next thing i reach for will not be my napkin i wish you no ill will but he let the sentence die with an apologetic little smile back to business said the dutchman doctor jones i am prepared to offer you double anything the major offers rubbish said the major ill match whatever that gross peddler of human flesh offers we englishmen must stick together and you rongeur i asked turning to the little man what do you have to say my offer is unchanged since this morning said the rodent but there is one thing i must add to it please do so i said i am willing to guarantee that none of my rivals will take shall we say unsavory means to show you his displeasure at not becoming your partner i do not think they can make the same guarantee i must confess that it was a contract stipulation that hadnt occurred to me and the more i thought about it the better the rodents offer began to look founding the tabernacle of saint luke was all well and good but not if the founder was to be buried beneath a cornerstone i suppose i wasnt upholding my poker face very well because the major laid a reassuring hand on my shoulder my dear doctor jones he said i assure you that my principals will not allow any harm to come to you if thats all that is worrying you i make you the same guarantee said the dutchman with the further stipulation that should my guarantee not for some unforeseen reason be fulfilled you will be brutally and thoroughly avenged brother dutchman i said as much as i appreciate the sentiments behind your statement i find it a mighty small comfort let us leave such dismal considerations aside for the moment and start talking cold hard cash excellent said the dutchman you know my terms i will give you a thousand percent return within ten days how will i find you ten days from now i asked you might ask the local constabulary said the major nastily he spends more time in jail than out of it you are hardly the one to make such a statement said the dutchman haughtily brethren i said i repeat my prime concern is making sure that i have some way of collecting all these wondrous profits that are being spoken of i couldnt love and trust you more if you were my own flesh and blood but then my own fleshand blood brother is currently serving time in arizona for trying to rob a restaurant therefore i feel that i need more than verbal assurances no matter how comforting they may be actually my brother was in jail in montana for doing vile things with a painted woman and her twelveyearold twin daughters but i saw no reason to bring his sordid misdeeds to light just to prove a point i appreciate your concern my dear sir said the major but you must understand that time is of the essence if the money is not presented by noon tomorrow the boat will leave for madagascar where the goods will be offered to erich van horst and who is this von horst i asked a blackhearted scoundrel said the dutchman a totally unprincipled swine but smart interposed the rodent yes smart said the dutchman no one even knows what he looks like or if von horst is his real name but he has made enormous inroads on this segment of our business in other words i said he is a competitor an understatement said the major the man is a monopolist far from being a competitor he tries to beat down competition at every opportunity in short he is an enemy of the freeenterprise system well brothers i said i certainly agree that we cant allow a man like that to blacken his soul still further he sounds like hes pretty nearly past redemption right now and ive certainly got no intention of helping old satan get his infernal claws on another brother through any action of mine no indeed we certainly cant be the cause of poor brother von horsts downfall excellent my dear doctor jones said the major we shall at least so to speak keep it within the family now with whom do you choose to associate yourself brothers i said i know i said i would announce my decision at dinner tonight but certain factors have been brought to light by our frank discussion if each of you will meet me for breakfast at my hotel tomorrow morning and tell me how you intend to protect both my investment and my health i will choose one of you in ample time for you to purchase your goods before noon i paused to borrow a swig of the majors liquor you understand that its not myself im concerned about but to rob me is to rob the lord of his tabernacle and that is just too sinful to contemplate well none of them looked too happy about it but i guess they all saw the wisdom of my position for they finally agreed though the rodent kept playing with his napkin and shooting regretful but meaningful glances at the major and the dutchman we kept drinking and talking about one thing and another for an hour or so and then captain peter clarke came back in i hadnt wanted to offend any of my friends but the truth of the matter is that i had been waiting for him just to make sure i got back to the hotel safe and sound so bidding them all adieu until morning i began walking back to my hotel in his company howd you make out with that pack of thieves said captain clarke still got your wallet so far so good brother clarke i said but there is something ive been meaning to discuss with you i turned quickly and saw three different but distinctive figures darting in and out amongst the shadows and what might that be doctor jones asked captain clarke i have a certain amount of cash on hand i said i know said captain clarke and being a godfearing and moral man i would never harm my fellow man so i carry no weapons now you made a statement earlier this evening about protective custody true he said but the situation has changed in the past hour our prison has only four cells and thanks to a drunken brawl at the waterfront i regret to inform you that all four of our accommodations are currently occupied i wasnt referring to myself brother clarke i said quickly as a man of the cloth i have naturally never spent so much as a minute in a jail cell and i think such an experience would be spiritually shattering then what did you have in mind doctor jones he said i have a certain amount of cash on hand i began so you said i wonder if i might put it in protective custody until shall we say ten oclock tomorrow morning well its highly irregular he said id rest much easier knowing its free from attack by vicious nightprowling bandits and other foul denizens of the city i said youd pick it up no later than ten oclock said captain clarke my word as a man of god i said raising my right hand and shooting a glance up toward heaven and youre willing to trust me youre a sworn defender of the law aint you i said all right doctor jones he said if this is truly your desire i suppose the city of daressalaam can keep your money in custody overnight where is it ill lead you to it i said just as soon as we manage to elude my dinner companions oh so you noticed them too he said with a smile it shouldnt be too difficult to get rid of them we speeded up our pace and began turning this way and that and within half an hour even the rodent must have been wondering where we had gone to then we doubled back to maurices where we crept around to the back of the building and i removed my money from beneath a large concrete block where i had hidden it the night before captain clarke counted it briskly then put it in his pocket and withdrew a pencil and a small notebook let me give you a receipt for it he said and scrawled laboriously that the police department of the city of dares salaam owed the right reverend doctor lucifer jones the sum of two thousand and forty british pounds payable upon presentation of this note all nice and official he said signing his name with a flourish see you tomorrow morning doctor jones i made my way back to the hotel where i found major dobbins the dutchman and the rodent waiting for me in the lobby i bade them all goodnight and went up to my room i was awakened by a pounding at the door i looked out the window and saw that it was still dark using the lords name for purposes other than it was intended i pulled on my pants and walked across the room when i opened the door all three of them practically fell through it gentlemen i said harshly i thought we were to meet at breakfast quickly said the major what have you done with the money i hardly consider that a proper request i said pushing my hair back out of my eyes the rodent pulled out his pistol and pushed it into my belly where is the money he shrieked brothers i said i am truly shocked i thought we had an understanding the money screamed the rodent who did you give it to to captain peter clarke of the daressalaam police force i replied angrily itll be kept there in safety and security until i make my decision although i added based on this unwarranted intrusion i wonder if the lord would wish me to enter into financial dealings with any of you fool yelled the dutchman and the rodent began crying whats going on here i said to the major who seemed to be the only one who had retained his composure after you evaded us he said we got to discussing matters when suddenly it dawned upon me that all of british east has extradition treaties with its neighboring nations so we sent le rongeur to check with the police and found that they had no record of a captain peter clarke i dont understand i said with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach you damned imbecile shrieked the rodent wiping the tears from his face you turned the money over to erich von horst i was struck dumb for a minute then i raced out the door and ran for the waterfront with the major the rodent and the dutchman close on my heels when we arrived the dutchman pointed out the pier where the ship was docked and we got there just in time to see it putting out to sea von horst still dressed in his british police uniform was standing on the deck and as his eyes fell upon us a broad smile spread over his face then he bowed deeply straightened up and gave us a snappy german military salute just before the fog obscured him and the boat from my vision i left my companions weeping and cursing on the pier silently promised the lord never to offer my pearls to swine again gathered up my few worldly possessions and left quietly so as not to disturb the desk clerk then pausing only long enough to refresh my spirit at maurices i left the sinful city of dar essalaam behind me and set forth once again to do the good lords bidding chapter the vampire how i met herbie miller and made eighteen thousand dollars in twentyseven days came about like this shortly after i took my leave of daressalaam i did a little computing and figured out that fifty british pounds which was all i had in my pocket wasnt quite enough to start building my tabernacle so i went out into the wilderness of which there was an awful lot back in those days and had a little conference with my silent partner who advised me that if i was to properly carry on his work id need considerably more in the way of a grubstake it was about this time that karamojo bell and deaf banks and pondoro taylor and john alfred jordan were making big names and even bigger fortunes for themselves by the killing of elephants and i figured that with god to guide my bullets knocking off a few tons of ivory shouldnt be so very difficult of course i did have a couple of minor problems for one thing i didnt know the first thing about tracking or killing elephants and in fact had never even held a rifle in my hands for another elephant licenses were very expensive though since the tabernacle of saint luke was to be a nonprofit enterprise i felt certain that the purchasing of licenses didnt really apply to me just the same kenya and tanganyika were pretty well patrolled by game wardens and various other gendarmes who might view the license situation more narrowly which meant that i would have to go to the interior to find my fortune i had heard tell of huge herds of elephants in the lado enclave a large and savage area just west of uganda this wasnt officially in africas dark interior but it was interior enough for me since i didnt know where to begin looking for it i took the east african railway to the railhead in uganda a long and arduous trip which left me barely enough money to buy an old military rifle i spent my last couple of pounds buying bullets and then asked the local constabulary to direct me to the enclave he waved his hand in a northerly direction which covered approximately threequarters of uganda and so armed only with my rifle and a copy of the good book i began my career as an ivory hunter i had walked about fifteen miles when night fell and i spent a chilly few hours communing with god and nature out in the african bush i awoke stiff and hungry especially hungry and decided to hone my aim while shooting down a little something for breakfast i began walking through the grasslands and came upon an old waterbuck grazing alone seventeen shots later he was still grazing and i began to realize that there was more to hunting than i had been led to believe after my first two shots thudded home into a tree some fifty feet from him he didnt even bother to run away but just stared at me for a moment and then went back to his grazing i kept walking north for the better part of a week living on a diet of fruits and berries and wondering how i was going to kill an entire herd of elephants unless they stood in a nice long nosetotail line so that my bullets were bound to hit some thing the vegetation was getting pretty lush which meant that the ticks and flies and spiders and mosquitoes were out in force then one afternoon i saw a native village in the distance and remembering my experience with kitungas friends and relations i decided to give it a wide berth as i was doing so i came to an undersized and undernourished white man staked out in the sun good day to you brother i said walking up to him good afternoon friend he replied turning his head to get a better look at me lovely day i said wondering what to say or do next think it may rain though he said i looked up at the sky not enough clouds the rainy season is just about over by the way brother are you trussed up on the ground for any particular reason none that i happen to agree with friend he said it was done to me by a vile and barbarous tribe called the ankole i wonder if you being a godfearing christian and a white man to boot would mind cutting me loose of these here stakes well brother i said it does seem the christian thing to do on the other hand i passed an ankole village not too far from here and they might not understand a gesture of christian charity i sat down beside him to mull it over in my mind what did you do that set them against you they objected to some of my personal tastes and habits he said blinking his eyes to get some of the sweat out youre not some kind of moral degenerate are you i said my good pious blood starting to boil about the edges perish the thought neighbor he said vigorously it was a simple misunderstanding now wont you be a gentleman and cut a fellow white man free ive got to weigh the question carefully i said shooting a glance in the direction of the village to see if any of them were approaching us well in the meantime he said his skin kind of twitching you wouldnt have any insect repellent with you would you friend sorry i said you must be right uncomfortable well its getting kind of warm what with the sun beating down on me and insects crawling all over me he admitted how about some gin being staked out like this is mighty dry work a tsetse fly landed on his face and began crawling up his nose whats your name brother i asked shooing the fly away miller he said herbie miller from amarillo texas well im pleased to make your acquaintance brother miller i said extending my hand and then quickly withdrawing it when i realized that he was in no position to respond in kind and im the honorable doctor lucifer jones pastor of the tabernacle of saint luke pleased to meet you said herbie id get up but i quite understand brother miller whats a fellow like you doing out here in the wilderness anyway i was fighting as a mercenary for the british against the germans in tanganyika during the great war but they threw me out and ive been wandering around africa ever since why did they throw you out i asked personality conflict he said with the whole british army id like to go into the matter in greater detail said herbie but theres a poisonous scorpion crawling up my leg and i fear that my story may come to an abrupt and painful end if you dont do something about him doctor jones sir i flicked the scorpion away and stomped on it then the good lord took a hand in the proceedings and hit me with another of his revelations when you were in the army did you ever have occasion to fire a rifle i asked i most certainly did said herbie you know id even settle for a little taste of vodka how good a shot were you a crackerjack shot sir said herbie but you neednt worry doctor jones id never turn on the man who set me free and besides i dont have any weapons with me you ever shoot an elephant i asked on occasion he said then his face tensed up dont tell me theres an elephant about to charge us wouldnt think of it i said pulling out a jackknife and cutting his bonds thank you doctor jones he said rising to his feet and rubbing some circulation back into his extremities i threw a friendly arm around his shoulders think nothing of it brother miller after all what are partners for partners he said i nodded we left the area right quick not wishing to run into any ankole tribesmen who might not understand the fact that i couldnt leave a fellow white man to the mercies of the elements and headed on up to the outpost of arua just a handful of miles from the ugandacongo border how much money do you have i asked herbie maybe five pounds he said pulling out some faded miscolored bills and a handful of coins give it to me i said and wait for me about a mile west of town thats all the money i have in the world he protested how do i know youll come back i tossed the rifle to him keep this as security he began walking to the west and i entered the outpost and sought out the local bar i waited for the better part of an hour until a pair of men dressed in british military uniforms came in inside of five minutes everyone else had left and i walked up to the bar announcing in a loud voice that id like to buy a drink for everyone in the house they looked around figured out that i meant them and invited me to join them at their table pleased to meet you brothers i said im the honorable right reverend doctor jones preaching my way across this savage continent pleased to make your acquaintance said the older of the two men im captain michael holmes and this is lieutenant richard thorpe where are you heading for wherever i can bring peace and contentment to my fellow man i said devoutly ill go anyplace where the spirit of these godless savages needs uplifting thats highly commendable said lieutenant thorpe i wish there were more people like you padre why thank you kindly brother thorpe i said signaling the bartender to bring the bottle have another drink we got to talking for a while then and drinking pretty hard and before long we were all loosened up and pretty good friends i just think its wonderful said captain holmes after a long silence what is i asked a man of god going fearlessly through the bush bringing the word and the spirit to the savages theres no resisting the call once it comes to rest on you brother i said modestly however id be iying if i didnt tell you that im far from fearless certainly you are objected captain holmes how could you be a coward rubbing shoulders with cannibals and pygmies and the like ill tell you brother holmes i said not all of us are afraid of the same things now as for me i know that all men are gods children so i dont have no fear when i walk into a native village but that dont mean i aint afraid of other things such as such as elephants brother holmes i said with a shudder creatures of satan they are with them incredible proboscises and little red eyes and able to crush the life out of a man so easy like i downed another drink emphatically nothing to worry about padre said thorpe theres no elephants within twenty miles of here a comfort i said a definite comfort but my call has been made clear to me brothers i got to go through some place called the conclave or something like that and im told that its absolutely rife with bloodthirsty pachyderms you mean the lado enclave asked holmes the very spot i said the very spot indeed i dont suppose i could as one good christian to another ask one of you gentlemen to escort me safely through there sos i dont fall prey to some elephants dark and bloodthirsty desires im afraid not padre said thorpe were on duty here but elephants are a pretty peaceful lot by and large if you see any just give them a wide berth do one of you gentlemen have a map of the area i asked pouring them each another drink holmes pulled a map out of his vest pocket and unfolded it here you are reverend jones he said i found the lado enclave right quick and estimated it to be a dayandahalf march to the north and west then i picked a pencil out of my pocket and handed it to thorpe i wonder brother thorpe i said if you could mark the areas of the enclave ill most want to avoid you mean places with i nodded and gulped in terror right with elephants he looked at the map then drew seven or eight circles at various parts of the enclave okay reverend jones he said at last these represent the greatest concentrations of the herds if you just walk around these areas you should be okay you may run into a stray elephant now and then but youll avoid most of them i dont know how to thank you brothers i said folding up the map and sticking it inside my shirt you cant begin to know what a service youve done for the lord this day always happy to help a man of the cloth said thorpe as for thanking us its not necessary though if you run across any ivory poachers you might report them to us on your next swing through here i certainly will i said though i cant understand why anyone would kill elephants i would have thought youd approve said holmes for vengeance yes i said but for profit thats breaking the second and ninth commandments i took my leave of them then and wandered off to meet herbie what have you been doing he demanded when i got there securing our fortune i said throwing the map down in front of him i supply the brainpower you supply the marksmanship and we split the take fiftyfifty he asked onethird onethird onethird i corrected him come again said herbie onethird for you onethird for me and onethird for the lord he kept insisting that this was really a twotoone split for me so after some further haggling we finally decided on fifty five percent of the first ten thousand pounds for me fortyfive percent for herbie and the lord had an option on the next three thousand pounds we decided that wed better be up and on the trail bright and early the next morning so we turned in almost immediately during the middle of the night i felt a sharp pain in the side of my neck and figuring it was some small lizard or beetle i tried to flick it off with my hand and wound up poking herbie in the eye goddamnit he screamed rubbing his eye vigorously what did you want to go and do that for lucifer why dont you tell me just what you were doing bending over my neck i snapped its personal moaned herbie still holding his hand over his eye its more than personal i said its perverted kissing a mans neck when hes sleeping i wasnt kissing you lucifer he whined honest i wasnt just see that it dont happen again i said and lay back down on my blanket and not ten minutes later i felt this pain in my neck again herbie i yelled and he must have jumped five feet into the air what the hell is going on well lucifer he sighed you might as well know the truth that youre some kind of moral degenerate no then what im a vampire he said you mean like goes around sucking blood and such i said he nodded sadly i wish i wasnt i mean you have no idea the strain it puts me under but i am and thats all there is to it how long have you been a vampire oh about ten years now maybe eleven you know lucifer i dont think theres any group anywhere in the world thats more misunderstood than us vampires i mean i hope you dont think i like nabbing people in the neck and drinking their blood he shuddered its disgusting then why do you do it im compelled to just like youre compelled to drink water he answered its not a matter of choice but ive seen you in the sunlight i said i thought vampires couldnt do that european vampires cant said herbie its like a whole different union ive seen you eat meat i said ive seen you eat meat too he shot back doesnt stop you from needing water does it is this why you were kicked out of the army i asked he nodded and why the ankole had you staked out yes he said believe me lucifer im a better person for being able to talk about it im not like this all the time really im not most of the time im just as normal as you are its just that sometimes i well i get this craving do you have it now i asked he stared long and hard at my neck no he said with a relieved sigh i think its gone now he paused for a moment then nodded vigorously yes im sure its gone good i said walking over and tying him to a tree ill let you loose in the morning i went back to my blanket and lay down i think ill probably be tying you up every night nothing personal you understand i understand youve no idea how comforting it is to be able to talk about this with someone he said just as i was drifting off to sleep you know some missionaries have set up a hospital over in masindi and they probably have a fair supply of blood there i dont suppose we could no we couldnt i said and fell asleep we spent the next day footslogging and by midmorning of the second day we had reached the outskirts of the lado enclave we made camp early and fell to studying captain michael holmes map trying to figure out the quickest way to get to the nearest of the herds finally we bedded down and were up about an hour before sunrise we began finding piles of fresh elephant dung about noon and within about two hours had snuck to within a quarter mile of a herd of maybe two hundred of the beasts herbie lay down on his belly tested the wind with a handful of dry dirt and began inching forward i looked at him for a minute then did the same since i was bigger than herbie i began getting a little ahead of him and i stopped when we were about eighty yards away from a huge bull with enormous tusks then just as i was about to suggest that we were close enough for a shot herbie sank his teeth into the side of my neck i let out a yell and all hell broke loose the elephants stood in a circle trunks extended trying to figure out where the noise had come from and then three or four of them started running straight at us i jumped up more mad at herbie than scared of the elephants and pointed down at the little vampire who was nibbling on my achilles tendon hes the one i screamed at the oncoming elephants just run right by me and flatten that little bloodsucker the elephants wheeled around like quarter horses and raced off in the other direction the second they saw and heard me and a moment later there wasnt an animal to be seen anywhere except for the one who was slowly getting up next to me i dont know what happened lucifer he said ive never done that in the daytime before you damned fool i screamed you could have gotten us both killed he just hung his head and looked so sad that all the anger evaporated right out of me all right i said patting him on the shoulder just try to give me a little warning next time were sneaking up on a herd of elephants okay well the next time didnt come for almost a week during which time herbie tried marching to his different drummer more and more often especially if i would nick myself while shaving but finally one morning we found about a dozen young males and one real old one with huge tusks lolling in a small wooded glen this time i made sure herbie went ahead of me and when he got within about forty yards of them he cut loose with a couple of shots and dropped the old tusker i ran up to look at the corpse and discovered that herbie was nowhere to be seen herbie i called up here lucifer he replied and i looked up and found him perched in a tree about twentyfive feet above the ground what are you doing up there i said theres always a chance that one of the others will come back he said and youve got all the rest of the bullets that shows a lot of foresight i said thank you lucifer what am i supposed to do if one of them comes back he paused thoughtfully then asked how good are you at climbing trees not very i said oh he said well do you know any real fast prayers knock off the comedy and come down here i said that wasnt a rhetorical question lucifer he said theres an elephant about fifty feet behind you and he looks very unhappy which was how i found out that i could climb trees after all we stayed on our branches for an hour or two after the elephant had left then climbed cautiously down and examined our ivory looks like about one hundred and thirty pounds a tusk i said at least said herbie then lucifer ive got a question what is it herbie how are we going to get the tusks off the elephant it was a right smart question at that we spent the better part of the afternoon hunting up long sharp stones and all of the next day chopping away at the tusks herbie got thirsty in his unique way toward late morning and i damned near flattened his head with my stone after which he was well behaved for the rest of the day by nightfall we had managed to chop off the tusks and not a moment too soon since our elephant wasnt turning into any nosegay and the vultures were getting dangerously low in the sky now what asked herbie now we carry them back to camp i said i dont know about you lucifer said herbie but i dont think i can lift my tusk of course you can i said i only weigh about a hundred and ten pounds said herbie try dragging it i said so he tried he got it about forty feet away from the carcass and collapsed okay i said ill tell you what well do grab the front end of my tusk ill take the rear end and well cart it to camp like that and then come back for the other one he agreed and we started off through the bush it was two hours later when we staggered into camp and we decided not to go back for the other tusk until the next morning poor herbie was so exhausted that he didnt even try to nab me in the neck that night before i tied him up and i literally had to kick him awake the next morning then stiff and sore and aching in every muscle we set out for our other tusk we never did find it all them bushes and trees and rivers and trails got to looking alike and after about seven or eight hours we had to admit we were as lost as two people were ever likely to get we wandered for another day or two and couldnt even find our original camp finally on our third day of searching we came to a wanderobo village where we were given a redcarpet treatment and feted like visiting ambassadors the chief was a nice old boy called nmumba and he had picked up a smattering of english from various hunters and traders over the years he sat us by his campfire surrounded us with his naked daughters and served us a native brew that was even more potent than kitungas every now and then hed make a joke the way we knew this was hed goose one of his daughters and shed shriek like all getout and this was our signal to laugh i was wondering what to do with herbie because it was getting near bedtime and it somehow didnt seem proper to truss him up while we were in nmumbas village i mentioned this to him and he looked downright serious as he answered me l really think youd better tie me up tonight lucifer he said ive been getting the craving real bad i suppose its all them naked necks if you say so i said also i have a feeling that hed be something less than a gentleman if he didnt offer us a couple of his daughters for the night ill never be able to make it said herbie im getting thirsty just thinking about them i made our excuses and took herbie off to a hut where i tied him up to one of the support poles if he offers us his daughters ill accept both of them just as a matter of good manners i said as i was securing the knots but dont you worry none brother herbie its my christian duty to keep them away from you which it was and which i did when i got up in the morning nmumba decided to show me around the village being careful to explain that it was only a temporary dwelling place since the wanderobo are basically nomads but that it was ours as long as his tribe remained there finally we walked over to a huge hut that had to be holding a good ten tons of ivory thats a mighty impressivelooking collection brother nmumba i said figuring out its worth down to the nearest shilling he looked pleased as punch the wanderobo are mighty hunters he said no question about that i replied did you kill them all with spears yes said nmumba proudly so tell me brother nmumba i said if the hunting is so good here why are you moving your people out of the enclave need new juju man you mean a witch doctor he nodded our juju man died four moons ago and we fear for our childrens health they all looked pretty healthy to me i said our last juju man made strong juju said nmumba but soon it will wear off and we must find another before my people sicken and die its nothing catching is it i asked backing off a bit just out of good manners no it is i have not words for it well we got to using sign language and just the merest bit of swahili i had picked up and it turned out that this particular juju was a form of preventative medicine i knew they didnt have no vaccinations out in the wilderness so i questioned him about the nature of it cut veins said nmumba im not sure i follow you brother nmumba i said cut like so he said pointing to a recently healed knife scar just between his earlobe and his jawbone bad blood goes out devils go out you mean the old juju man bled you he nodded very strong medicine it wasnt the first time id heard of bleeding as a disease preventive in fact it had been all the rage in the courts of europe for centuries but it was kind of surprising to find it being practiced out here in the bush and then i realized that it was more than surprising it was providential brother nmumba i said i think this may be your lucky day my friend is a juju man one of the greatest in all africa too small said nmumba doubtfully big things come in small packages brother nmumba i said not only can brother herbie bleed your people but he will take all the devils into his own body so they can never harm you again truly said nmumba do i look like the kind of man who would lie to you i said brother nmumba you cut me to the quick nmumba lowered his head in thought for a moment would he agree to be our juju man nothing would please him more i said truthfully good said nmumba then it is settled and the wanderobo can remain here for many moons well there is one little problem i said oh it would mean that my own people would be without a juju man and in exchange for this they would probably want some compensation not for myself you understand im happy just to be able to do my good friend nmumba a favor but they will probably have to go out and hire another juju man he didnt understand many of the words but the message came across loud and clear we sat down for some hard bargaining and half an hour later i had traded herbie miller to the wanderobo for twelve thousand pounds af ivory and porters to carry it down to mombasa for me which is how i made my first fortune and how herbie miller became the happiest witch doctor on the entire dark continent chapter slave trading it was with a certain feeling of quiet pride and accomplishment that i led my seventy porters eastward toward civilization carrying a modest fortune of ivory on their broad sweatstreaked backs we marched for about three days and headed north toward the sudan just to make sure that we didnt bother any game wardens or british officers who might have been in the area which is how i lost my fortune before i had a chance to build my tabernacle one night we were lying down by the campfire totally exhausted them from toting all that ivory and me from converting it into dollars inside my head when a bunch of shots rang out and pretty soon we were surrounded by a dozen arabs in full desert regalia now i know that on the surface it seems kind of hard to envision twelve men surrounding seventyone but its a lot easier than you might think when the twelve men have rifles and the seventyone dont anyway they motioned me to step aside and herded the porters into a tight little circle making them kneel down and raise their hands above their heads a gesture i was not unacquainted with but had previously seen only on sunday mornings and in games of chance involving little white cubes with spots painted on them not a bad haul said a familiar voice and ivory too not bad at all my friends then a fat man in a soiled white suit stepped out of the shadows and nodded to me dutchman i exclaimed doctor jones he replied with a smile what a pleasant surprise to see you once again my good friend what the hell is going on here i demanded i am afraid that you are responsible for my presence here my dear doctor jones smiled the dutchman pulling out a handkerchief and wiping the sweat from his pudgy face me indeed you see when herr von horst made off with a certain shipment of shall we say perishable goods purchasing them with funds that you freely gave to him i found that i had to expand my primary business to make up for the income you had cost me regrettable to be sure but fitting in a way would you not agree i most certainly would not i snapped that ivory and them porters are mine though of course if you want to rent them from me once they deliver the tusks im sure we can do a little business oh no my friend laughed the dutchman im doing my business right now you wouldnt happen to know your wrist and ankle sizes would you surely youre not thinking about putting shackles and chains on a fellow white man brother dutchman i said in horror what guarantee have i that you wont try to run away before we reach our destination he asked putting a pudgy hand to his chin and eyeing me warily youve got my word as a christian gentleman and a man of honor i replied get the chains he called to one of his arabs brother dutchman i cried its inhuman to chain me like i was some black heathen on the way to market surely we can work out some accommodation that would be mutually acceptable oh its just for a little while doctor jones he said once we get into the desert ill be happy to release you you will certainly after all ill have the only water for hundreds of miles in any direction and so i was chained hand and foot and neck to my seventy porters out of deference to my race and my position the dutchman chained me first in line which struck me as only just and fitting until i figured out that the first man in line was also the first to step on snakes and scorpions and other foul denizens of the desert and of course anytime one of the porters tripped or even slowed down i usually found out about it in an exceptionally painful and undignified way then there was the matter of the ivory the dutchman didnt want to leave it behind but it was kind of hard for the porters to carry shackled up as they were so we had to stop every half hour or so for them to shift the weight finally on the second evening of my captivity after our neck chains were unhooked for the night i moseyed over to where the dutchman was sitting alone by his fire mind if i join you i asked sitting down next to him as gracefully as my chains would allow as a matter of fact i do he replied taking a swig from a halfempty flask of something that sure didnt smell much like water after all how will it look to the hired help i dont even let them share my fire or my liquid refreshments he gestured to the twelve rifletoting arabs who were eyeing me with open hostility besides he continued i try never to mix business with pleasure if we got to talking and drinking and swapping lies id feel absolutely miserable about what im going to be doing to you in a week oh i said yes doctor jones it would fair break my heart on the whole i think it would be best if you were to quickly take leave of me and return to your porters well actually i didnt come over here to swap lies with you brother dutchman i said well if were speaking business thats a whole different matter said the dutchman suddenly alert he offered the flask to me have a drink doctor jones dont mind if i do i said taking a long sip and then another how much ivory do you suppose ive got here with me brother dutchman none he replied with a smile but if i understand the thrust of your question ive got about eighteen thousand dollars worth theres a lot more where that came from i said softly which was technically true since it had originally come from elephants and as far as i knew there wasnt any current and severe shortage of them youre suggesting that if i release you youll lead me to all this ivory asked the dutchman with a sly grin i nodded returning his grin well i do wish i could accommodate you doctor jones he said still smiling but the porters can hardly carry what weve got now besides ivory is very difficult to sell in egypt whereas but i think you get the point say no more brother dutchman i said confidently if its more black heathen you want i can round em up and have em here in no time you still dont seem to understand said the dutchman everyone sells natives natives are a drug on the market it is you doctor jones who constitutes the piece de resistance of my current consignment me i repeated you he said nodding sadly and because i have nothing against you personally other than the fact that you cost me a modest fortune back in daressalaam and are a scoundrel and liar to boot i must confess to you that it grieves me more deeply than you can imagine to have to sell you to ali ben ishak no matter how much he pays me ali ben ishak he nodded again nasty fellow is he i asked as a small knot formed in my belly and began to grow under other circumstances i wouldnt wish your fate on my worst enemy said the dutchman gravely tell me about him i said please my friend said the dutchman holding up a hand for silence i wish to speak no further on the subject it would only depress me if it upsets you all that much dutchman i suggested perhaps it might be better not to sell me to this ishak person after all my dear fellow he said severely this is business ill just have to learn to live with the guilt that being settled he had another swallow from his flask and ambled off to his tent his arabs shooed me away from the fire and i rejoined my porters thinking that maybe they werent such unfortunate souls after all at least compared to some people i could name like me for instance the next three days passed pretty uneventfully unless you think trudging across a desert with your hands and feet chained together qualifies as an event at that point which was five days into our little sojourn the dutchman had one of his arabs unshackle me after first explaining that we were at least a four day march from water of any kind now i could find a lot of fault with the dutchmans ethics and morals and appearance and even his personal hygiene but id never noticed much wrong with his business sense so when he told me that i took him at his word and made no attempt to sneak off from the caravan besides he still had my ivory and without it the tabernacle of saint luke wasnt likely to get itself built in the real near future every day id ask the dutchman about this ali ben ishak character and every day hed tell me that he was too fond of me to discuss the matter the only thing hed say was that ali ben ishak was one of the five wealthiest arabs in the world and that he the dutchman felt just terrible about this whole situation i must confess that the more i tried to talk about it the more he wasnt the only one who felt terrible finally i decided to put the entire thing in the hands of the lord after explaining the problem to him and making certain recommendations of my own thereafter i spoke no more about it and concentrated mostly on not dying of heat stroke a considerable task in its own right it was a week to the day since wed been captured that i looked ahead of me and saw a huge cloud of sand out near the horizon it came closer and finally i could make out a batch of arab sheikhs and warriors mounted on horseback and camels all wearing colorful robes and headgear and sporting expensivelooking rifles the dutchman signaled us to stop and then had us walk in a circle just like the oldtime pioneers did whenever indians drew near then he had his dozen men brandish their weapons and position themselves around our closeknit little group the leader of the mounted arabs signaled his own men to stop about twenty yards away then he rode his horse slowly toward me and the wanderobo circled us twice and turned to the dutchman slaves he asked cocking an eyebrow friends and relations said the dutchman hastily in chains asked the old sheikh i dont get along with them very well answered the dutchman where are you going asked the sheikh nairobi said the dutchman youre heading in the wrong direction said the sheikh we thought wed get a little exercise along the way said the dutchman and who are you asked the arab colonel t e lawrence replied the dutchman but my friends call me el aurens suddenly the old sheikhs attitude changed and he became positively servile after offering allahs blessings on the dutchman and his friends and relations he rejoined his men and beat a hasty path around us that was close sighed the dutchman wiping some sweat from his forehead how did you know theyd leave you alone if you told them you were lawrence of arabia i asked trial and error one batch almost tore me apart when i told them i was chinese gordon i guess they dont view the fall of khartoum quite the same way you and i do anyway after a number of confrontations i found that lawrences name worked best and what will happen if the real lawrence ever shows up i asked i imagine theyll think hes chinese gordon and tear him to pieces replied the dutchman with a chuckle he walked over to me and attached me to the porters again i hate to do this to you my friend he grated as he was attaching the chains but we reach cairo in two more days and i wouldnt want you to do anything unwise i promptly asked the lord to strike him down and set me free but evidently my silent partner was otherwise occupied at the time for i spent the next two days in chains walking north to cairo it was dark when we got to the outskirts of the city we made camp about three miles from one of the poorer sections of which there were an awful lot lit a campfire and allowed the arabs to ply us with a number of bottles of native beer when i remarked upon the dutchmans generosity he replied that while it was undoubtedly true that he was the very soul of generosity it would also serve to make us look a little fatter on the auction block the next morning and now doctor jones he added with a strange glint in his eye i think it is time for my men to unshackle you and bring you over here for a bath they did so and i must confess that the dutchman prepared the bath of my life for me it was sweetsmelling and filled with all kinds of soaps and oils then after i dried myself off the dutchman himself gave me a haircut and a shave after which two of the arabs gave me a rubdown and poured more oils onto me when all this was done the dutchman handed me back my clothes which had been washed while all this other preparation was going on i got into them and then he stood back hands on hips and just kind of stared at me oh yes he said at last eighty thousand maria theresa dollars at the very least well this made absolutely no sense to me because as far as i could see the whole damned lot of us plus the ivory wasnt going to bring anything near eighty thousand dollars and while ali ben ishak may very well have been one of the richest men in the world rich folk didnt get that way by overtipping or remembering the cooks birthday or bidding eighty thousand dollars for a slave in a bear market still if it made the dutchman happy to think otherwise it was no skin off my back and keeping my skin on my back had suddenly become pretty imperative to me pretty soon the dutchman and the arabs began drinking the leftover beer and since i was still unchained i kind of helped them a bit it must have been a lot stronger than i thought because in about half an hour only the dutchman was still awake and he and i got to talking about old times and sipping generously from his flask and within another ten minutes or so he was out cold i gave serious consideration to trying to free the porters but i didnt want to chance waking up any of the arabs while searching for the keys to their chains and besides some one had to stick around to carry all that ivory back to mombasa so i just gave them a brief but friendly smile and raced off toward the city being in my usual marvelous condition and a fine figure of a man as well it took me only a couple of hours to negotiate the intervening three miles and i arrived in cairo hardly panting at all i must have come in the back way or something because while there were a lot of huge palaces at the far end of town i was in an area of twisting streets and little white shacks i asked two or three locals for directions but they kept speaking some foreign tongue so i just kept on walking past the bazaars and the ramshackle housing and such until i suddenly found myself on what seemed to be a main road i hopped on the back of a slowmoving doubledecker bus rode about a mile and slipped off without distracting the conductor from his appointed duties finally i saw a white man in a white suit just like the dutchmans only not so soiled and wearing a straw hat and i walked up to him good evening brother i said no handouts he grunted and kept walking now brother i said falling into step beside him do i look like a man in need of a handout i happen to be the right reverend doctor jones pastor of the tabernacle of saint luke from down south of here must be a mighty small church he grated theres nothing but sand south of here what direction are we walking i said quickly north you numbskull he said with some distaste well that explains it i said my church is to the east of here i just got turned around a little he stopped hands on hips and glared at me just what the hell is it that you want he demanded nothing much brother i replied i just need some directions well he persisted if you were looking for a slave market in cairo just where do you suppose youd find it i asked at last i dont traffic in slaves he said coldly neither do i i assured him quickly in fact its my intention to buy a batch of them poor lost souls and set them free a noble sentiment he said still looking a mite suspicious however i still cant help you now if youll just stop following me ill just a minute i said suddenly smitten by another revelation where would i find ali ben ishak what would someone like you want with someone like him he demanded hes my partner i replied the two of us plan to crisscross the countryside buying slaves and setting them adrift on a sea of freedom not that i believe a word of all this he said but ali ben ishak lives in that huge domed building up ahead i looked ahead in the direction he indicated and saw an enormous building about the size of the white house at the top of a mild incline that one i asked pointing to it no he answered thats just the governmental palace ishak lives in the big one over toward the left i looked again and saw a goldspired building that completely dwarfed the government palace each of my porters could have had two rooms and a bath and would probably only have taken up the first floor of the guest wing thank you brother i said heading off toward ali ben ishaks abode may the good lord look after you it was a sincere blessing especially since the lord hadnt done such an allfired good job of looking after him so far this evening what with me having removed his wallet while he was pointing out the government palace to me i reached ali ben ishaks door in about fifteen minutes i could tell right off that i wasnt going to have to spend a lot of time searching for a doorbell and wondering how to introduce myself because two huge egyptians wearing fancy headdresses and baggy pants and not much else withdrew their wickedlooking swords when i tried to enter what is your business here asked one of them in a much higher voice than fit his body oh nothing special i said quickly i just stopped by to see if your boss would like to make a friendly little contribution to the tabernacle of saint luke the master supports no charities said the other in an equally falsetto voice whos talking charity i said the tabernacle of saint luke is perfectly willing to make an equally friendly contribution to ali ben ishak why dont one of you boys run off and bring your master down here the two conferred in low whispers for a moment then one of them put two fingers into his mouth and let loose with a shrill whistle and a minute later another halfnaked muscleman in baggy pants and a turban showed up there was some more whispering a few gestures a whole lot of staring at me and then the new arrival told me to follow him and let me tell you that was some house i followed him through all the draperies were made of spun gold and more jewels than you could shake a stick at sat in glass cases along the walls of the main gallery each being guarded by a swarthylooking egyptian with a curved sword we walked through a dining room that would comfortably have sat twelve or thirteen hundred close friends and admirers circled a tiled pool that was only a little bit smaller than lake victoria and finally we came to a halt in what sure as blazes seemed like a throne room at any rate it was a huge room filled with ornate persian rugs and there was only one chair in it a big luxurious cushioned thing that sat smackdab in the middle of the floor i will tell the master that you are here said my guide vanishing through a doorway that was pretty much hidden by some hanging tapestries since i found myself alone with a few minutes on my hands i decided to take a look at some of ali ben ishaks trinkets and doodads that were sitting on shelves all over the room and discovered with some dismay that they were all carvings and paintings and other renderings of naked white men with an occasional white boy thrown in for good measure suddenly it occurred to me why the dutchman was so sure id bring all that money and i lost no time in heading back the way id come in but as i got to the door two more of those damned egyptian heathens appeared from nowhere and crossed their swords right in my path i considered stooping down and walking under the blades but thought better of it and went back to the interior of the throne room looking vainly for a little dirt to rub onto my skin then a silkandsatinclad figure kind of old and skinny but wearing enough jewelry to make him look twenty and handsome in the eyes of most women entered from behind the tapestries i smelled him about three seconds before i saw him and i stopped worrying about all the scents that the dutchman had rubbed onto me they were drowned out by his perfume the moment he entered the room ali ben ishak i said extending my hand and thanking the lord that none of the arabs had thought to give me a manicure yes he purred and you are mister doctor i corrected him the right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service in a manner of speaking i added hastily and to what do i owe the extreme pleasure of this visit doctor jones he asked staring at me through halflowered lids which gave him a sort of cockeyed look i believe we have a little business to transact i said have we indeed he giggled easing himself onto the chair ali ben my friend i aint going to mince words with you i began i have a certain commodity to sell that i just know is going to meet with your approval it already has he said how can it i asked you dont even know what im talking about i understand perfectly he simpered dont go understanding me so allfired fast i said quickly as i was saying ive brought this particular commodity all the way from the lado enclave at enormous personal expense and hardship knowing that a man of your taste and status would properly appreciate it im sure i will he breathed you can search the whole of africa and you wont find none better i said what an absolutely charming notion said ali ben ishak closing his eyes and smiling a very strange smile well then i said i suppose wed better get down to talking price brother ali ben for anyone else id charge thirty or thirtyfive thousand dollars but for you the price is a dirt cheap twenty grand thats more than im accustomed to paying he said petulantly youre getting six tons i pointed out that comes to less than two dollars a pound six tons he screamed what are you talking about ivory i said what are you talking about oh nothing he muttered blushing the prettiest shade of pink i ever did see have we got a deal i asked well we got to haggling and bargaining and finally i sold him the ivory for sixteen thousand dollars which was less than i wanted but also sixteen thousand dollars more than i had so i guess we were both pretty pleased about it you going to be sending your servants out after it i asked immediately he replied and i trust you will remain as my guest until they return with the ivory itll be my pleasure brother ali ben i said since i could see i didnt have much choice in the matter he summoned a pair of his majordomos and i told them exactly where the goods were while you fellows are out there i added ive got eightythree items for tomorrows slave auction would you be good enough to bring them back and clean em up a little for me they looked at ali ben ishak who nodded his approval and then took their leave nice fellows i said they used to be he answered through pursed lips i read about fellows like that in the good book i said they were enochians or something like that werent they he didnt answer but just looked kind of wistful and i could see that he wasnt in a mood to talk to me anymore so i ambled off found myself a goosefeather mattress covered with satin sheets and a fur blanket and plunked myself down for the night one of those squeakyvoiced enochians woke me in the morning and i didnt even have time to scrounge up a little something to eat before ali ben ishaks whole entourage including me were out the door and headed toward the slave market it was a grungy grimy little place just west and a bit south of town but it was crammed to overflowing with sheikhs and sultans and potentates who were all dressed to the nines when we got there they were auctioning off an east indian woman who i wouldnt have minded bidding on myself and i followed ali ben ishak to a row of chairs that seemed to have been set aside especially for him and his retainers next the twelve blearyeyed arabs came on as a single unit and i spent a goodly amount of time rummaging on the floor looking for diamonds and other trinkets that my neighbors might have dropped until they were knocked down for ten thousand dollars and led out of sight and earshot and then cursing so loud we could hear him while he was still outside the building the dutchman was dragged up onto the auction block lot number announced the auctioneer he tried to show the dutchmans teeth to the crowd and almost got his finger bitten off for his trouble there he is screamed the dutchman catching sight of me theres the son of a pig whos responsible for this i stood up and waved to the crowd who cheered raucously and threw a few coins in my direction you dont understand bellowed the dutchman hes supposed to be up here being sold im supposed to be down there the mans obviously gone off the deep end lord protect him i said somberly i ask you brothers to compare our appearances do i look like a man whos been dragged through the desert to stand on the block or better still ask my host and good friend ali ben ishak that quieted everyone down for a while and the auctioneer went back to telling the crowd how much work the dutchman would be happy to do in a thirtyhour day but ali ben ishak paid no attention instead he just stared long and hard at me is something troubling you brother ali ben i asked at last im just wondering how you did it he purred did what managed to trade places with the dutchman i know who he is of course i dont suppose youd like to let that little tidbit of knowledge remain our personal secret would you i said if i tell what i know you will be put on the auction block he said more to himself than to me and if i were to bid on you his voice trailed off and he looked thoughtfully at me brother ali ben i know what youre thinking and while its immoral and disgusting and unchristian as all getout i just cant bring myself to hold it against you given that im doubtless the handsomest young buck youve ever run across but a lot of these other guys have been looking at me just the way you have and its only fair to warn you that if i go on the block ill probably cost you a million dollars or more i have it on good authority that the sultan of graustark himself has authorized his agents to go that high for me oh he said knitting his brows whereas a rumsoaked foulmouthed old sex fiend like the dutchman ought to go for five thousand dollars tops but hes so so ali ben ishak searched for the right word i know i said but dry him out for a month starve him for a couple more and buy him a wig and youll be surprised at the change in him i mean hell never look as good as me lord knows but you can make yourself one hell of a bargain he lowered his head lost in thought for about three minutes when he rejoined the land of the living the price on the dutchman was eight hundred dollars and rising by tendollar increments ali ben ishak put in a bid of three thousand and got him before the opposition could muster a rally then they marched out my seventy porters and while they were showing off each ones teeth in turn a big one on the end gestured to me to come up to the platform i did so and he leaned over and whispered in my ear it is not commonly known that i speak english he said it aint even uncommonly known i replied in surprise why in tarnation didnt you ever speak to me during that whole goddamned long trek through the desert i never had anything to say he replied and now you do i asked oh yes he said with a grim smile and if you do not find a way to free me and my fellow tribesmen i am going to say it to everyone in this room i am sure the auctioneer would like to know that since the dutchman is in no position to make any claims he can keep one hundred percent of the proceeds he could realize from your sale rather than merely his commission the auctioneer walked over and gave me an inquiring look which i answered with a sick little grin then i returned to my seat the bidding is open announced the auctioneer four thousand for the lot said one potentate five said another seven offered a bejeweled rajah eight thousand i said wondering if my remaining eight thousand was enough to start my tabernacle nine said the rajah ten i said and thats all those lazy bastards are worth eleven said the rajah i told you ten was all they were worth i shouted you got wax in your ears or something twelve and thats my last bid thirteen said the rajah fourteen i said maybe i can get that much out of them before the law discovers i own em the law asked one of the potentates they ate their chief i answered the rajah walked up to the platform and looked them over long and hard they really ate their chief would i lie to you i said fifteen he said after much hesitation sixteen i said theyre also homosexual rapists ali ben ishak jumped to his feet to make a bid but i stomped on his toe and he sat back down cursing the rajah took another long hard look shook his head and walked back to his seat sold for sixteen thousand dollars cried the auctioneer i looked at my englishspeaking porter who just grinned at me turn em loose and point em south i said i changed my mind theyre just too dangerous to keep the auctioneer shrugged and i heard a voice in the back of the room say well you know those bigshot american millionaires easy come easy go the auction ended in another hour and once again penniless i took my leave more than willing to let ali ben ishak keep the auction money i should have been paid for the arabs and the dutchman in exchange for his silence well not quite penniless he did pay me two hundred dollars for presiding at the ceremony that wed him once and forever to caesare tobur alias winston riles alias hans gerber alias horst brokow alias the dutchman it may have been a little irregular but i did my usual heartrending job at least i dont recall ever seeing any bride cry and carry on quite as much as the dutchman did chapter the mummy there are worse things than being in cairo in the summer you can for example be in cairo in the summer with no money no food no friends one suit of clothes and a crazy dutchman spreading vile and terrible lies about you to anyone who will listen or you can be in cairo in the summer with no money no food no friends one suit of clothes a crazy dutchman spreading vile and terrible lies about you to anyone who will listen and be stalked down a lonely alleyway by a tall dark figure that keeps just out of sight which i was in point of fact the street which was pretty well lit was just a few short yards away but it was presently populated by a trio of young men with whom i had recently indulged in certain games of chance involving laminated cardboard rectangles with interesting and intricate markings on both sides not wishing to bring up bitter memories i felt it wise to remain off the beaten track so to speak when it suddenly came to my attention that my particular track wasnt quite so unbeaten as i might have wished every time i took a step so did this shadow behind me and every time i stopped it stopped too at first i didnt pay it much attention since i had nothing anyone could possibly want but then i got to thinking and decided that any civilized man might well have something some of these egyptians might want if only his shoes well this catandmouse business went on for the better part of twenty minutes at the end of which time i would have traded my soul for a cold bottle of beer inasmuch as being stalked through the slums of cairo is mighty thirsty work when finally this figure stepped out of the shadows holding a wickedlooking dagger in its hand its all a mistake i hollered throwing my hands up over my head this resemblance between me and rudolph valentino is purely superficial i aint made away with no egyptian women that i can recall aw goddamnit its you muttered a deep voice what the hell are you doing here at this time of night lucifer i edged closer to get a better look it turned out to be the englishspeaking porter why aint you back with your tribesmen hightailing it for uganda i asked when id finally recognized him i decided to stay here and seek fame and fortune he replied lowering his dagger you expect to find them in an alley at four in the morning i asked this wasnt my first choice he admitted sheepishly but did you ever try to rob a bank with only a knife so why didnt you buy a gun i asked with a certain detached curiosity with what he demanded all i have is this damned loincloth lucifer im freezing to death well brother i told him freezing to death is one thing i dont have to worry about no he said skeptically no i assured him im gonna starve to death long before that well sorry to have bothered you he said walking off hold on i called after him maybe we ought to pool our resources and form a partnership i dont know about that he said after some thought your last partner is probably drinking my wifes blood at this very moment but hes happy and wellfed i pointed out you gotta consider exactly who and what my last partner was true he said slowly but none of this poor black heathen crap were equal partners or the whole things off and ill probably rob you of your clothes brother i said sincerely you got me all wrong the good lord explicitly forbids me to take advantage of partners of any race especially when they got me beat by six inches and a good fifty pounds by the bye whats your name you couldnt pronounce it he said haughtily try me i said kanchupja he said that being the case i will call you friday i told him he shrugged in assent friday it is then i said and now friday my partner and cherished friend i dont suppose youve got any foodstuffs to toss into our mutual pool of resources he held his naked arms above his nearnaked body and turned once around just where do you suppose id be hiding them lucifer he asked just curious i said i see that youve got an undershirt and a top shirt on said friday i dont suppose youd care to turn one of them over to me aint no sense both of us freezing i replied you aint using your head at all tonight friday it occurs to me that just based on brainpower alone a fiftyfifty partnership may not be the most equitable arrangement ever to come down the pike you can be an equal partner or a naked victim said friday seriously i dont recall offering you a third alternative he placed his hand meaningfully on the hilt of his dagger well partner as long as you put it that way i guess everything is settled i said quickly we decided to set off in search of food and clothing by sunrise we still werent exactly the bestdressed or fattest men in town so when a crowd began forming on one of the main thoroughfares we just naturally followed them hoping for a handout or two or at least a couple of bulging and unprotected pockets what we found was a caravan filled to the brim with golden statues and other baubles all of them worth a pretty penny or two some fellow in khaki shorts and shirt and an oversized pith helmet was standing next to all this stuff answering questions that a bunch of reporters was tossing up at him what seems to be causing all the commotion brother i asked a european who was standing on the outskirts of the crowd trying to get a peek of the goingson why dont you ever read a newspaper friend he replied this is the first load of treasure to be removed from king tuts tomb and where might i find this king tut i asked figuring that any king who gave away gold in such quantities ought to have a little food and a couple of suits left over for a young and modest christian gentleman who had just undergone months of privation on the dark continent i guess you dont read the papers at that laughed the european king tutankhamen has been dead for more than three thousand years just settling the estate now are they i asked not wishing to appear unduly ignorant my companion shook his head with a smile king tuts tomb was discovered on december of last year by an englishman named lord carnarvon and an american named carter its the greatest archaeological find in history yeah i replied what all did they find all kinds of antiques gilt couches and alabaster vases covered with hieroglyphics and of course they found tut himself the boy king who had been buried with all these marvels millennia ago so now that they found all this stuff who are they going to sell it to i asked sell it he looked horrified my good man all of these fabulous items from antiquity will be put on public display he looked long and hard at me and then added under extremely heavy guard of course of course i agreed nodding my head thoughtfully and what about old tut himself they gonna finally give him a decent christian burial you must be mad thundered the european tut is the greatest find of all theyll be displaying his mummy all over the world you mean to tell me brother that theyre going to take this dead little boy all wrapped up in bandages and put him on display i exclaimed why its uncivilized theyre considering bids from various countries right this moment said my companion bids why would a country pay good coin of the realm to put a mummy on display theyll charge tourists and recoup their money never fear he replied but theyll be doing it for the prestige the profits will be merely incidental i thanked him for all this information and moseyed on back to friday who had been busy relieving onlookers of their excess change while they were watching the caravan look lucifer he said holding up a wad of pound notes at least we wont freeze or starve the possibility aint never crossed my mind i said looking around for a store that sold notions and similar goods but better still i think i have hit upon our first business venture first let me get something to wear said friday heading off toward a nearby haberdashery i grabbed his arm hooking it in my own and kept walking coals to newcastle i said im going to dress you from head to toe what are you talking about demanded friday with a suspicious look on his face brother friday just put yourself and your economic future in my hands i said reassuringly i promise that by nightfall youll be the warmest man in all egypt this isnt going to hurt is it he asked warily not a bit brother friday youre sure he persisted brother the only thing thats getting hurt around here is my feelings when i see this lack of trust on your face i told him now lets get to work we began by hunting up a notions shop and buying a couple of hundred feet of bright white bandages then we found a little storefront smackdab in the middle of the avenue of the pharaohs and plunked down a pound for a weeks rent now what asked friday as we unloaded our bandages into the empty store now you take a few shillings i said and go out shopping for a couple of pieces of white cardboard and a can of paint and what will you be doing friday you are the most suspicious partner a mortal man ever did have i complained im just going out to do a little serious thinking i keep feeling that we need a little something else but i cant quite put my finger on what it is he muttered some gibberish in swahili and stalked off to make his purchases while i deciding that i could think better on my feet than sitting in the store began walking up and down the winding streets of cairo i guess i had gone about half a mile when a small but very rounded figure shot out of a doorway and grabbed me by the hand i have lost my heart to you noble sir she breathed her dark eyes shimmering above the veil that obscured the rest of her face and suddenly it dawned on me exactly what our little business venture was lacking it aint nothing to be ashamed of i admitted smiling down at her lots of ladies have felt even stronger emotions on less notice me being a christian and a gentleman and an american to boot i am overcome by an allpervading desire to give of myself freely to you she whispered freely you say i repeated as she began leading me into the doorway from which she had emerged well she said modestly dropping her gaze there is a small handling and cover charge as well as an entertainment tax sister i said still smiling at her i have a feeling that you and me were meant for each other good she said and from the way her eyes kind of crinkled up at the corners i knew she was returning my grin shall we get the crass commercial details over with suits me fine i agreed of course i aint got any money but oh damn she snapped stamping her little foot in rage not another one i do have a counteroffer to make though i said forget it she said why dont you go back to sweeping them off their feet in peoria or biloxi or some other backwater where paupers can whered you ever hear of them places i interrupted where do you suppose she said ripping the veil from her face why youre a white woman i exclaimed what in blazes are you doing here im an entertainer i can see that i said admiringly i mean a nightclub entertainer then how i began there are only two nightclubs in town she explained i played for a week in each that made me about a tenth of what i need to get back home and now she added putting her veil back over her face if youll excuse me ive got to get back to work you sure you wouldnt like me to take you away from all this i asked what are you talking about i told you ive got a little business proposition to make i said listen mister she said putting her hands on her hips i may not be the most expensive girl in cairo but on the other hand youve already admitted that you dont have a penny to your name what do you intend to pay me with onethird i said smiling onethird of what she demanded onethird of the stock of course what stock are you talking about she said the stock in our little company i replied think it over its nice safe indoor work and you can keep on your feet just what kind of scam do you have going she asked suddenly with just a trace of professional curiosity thats a word i am unfamiliar with i said but i have the distinct impression that if i understood it i would be very sorry that i had opened my heart to you miss ah i didnt quite catch your name rosepetal she said rosepetal schultz and no snickering the thought never crossed my mind i replied and i am the right reverend doctor lucifer jones pastor of the tabernacle of saint luke really she said dubiously youre not just some religious nut whos going to dress me up like a nun and then make vile suggestions of course not i said this is strictly business let us proceed to our corporate headquarters on the avenue of the pharaohs where i shall introduce you to our silent partner we have a silent partner asked rosepetal not at the moment i admitted but by tonight he will be we kept walking talking about this and that and the next thing and before too long we arrived at the store just as friday was returning with his purchases well hello he said his face lighting up friday this is rosepetal our new partner i told him i dont know what lucifer has in mind for you but im all for it he enthused then he turned to me what do you want me to do with all this stuff i bought start painting signs i said what kind of signs he asked oh signs that tell all and sundry that the mummy of rosepetal name a pharaoh how about tutankhamen she suggested no hes been used i said try a different one amenophis iii is the only other one i know she said although i suppose there must have been an amenophis i and ii i turned back to friday have the signs say that the mummy of amenophis iii will be on display from six in the evening until midnight at oh three shillings per customer ill have to get a paintbrush said friday do that i said and buy yourself a big dinner charge it to the company and friday he stopped in the doorway yes i wouldnt drink too much coffee if i were you i said lucifer he said i hope you dont think that im going to let you wrap me up as a mummy perish the thought i said reassuringly he stared long and hard at me again and then left if hes not going to be the mummy who is asked rosepetal who says hes not going to be the mummy but you told him she began i told him not to think about it i replied good advice too it would only depress him and now if youll excuse me for an hour or so i have to do a little shopping why dont you make yourself at home and sort of tidy things up a bit within the next hour i had bought a dilapidated wooden coffin and a batch of gold foil paper and had them both sent right to the store i picked up a couple of things for rosepetal and then returned friday had finished painting the signs and was already at work coating the coffin with the gold foil i had rosepetal help me hang the signs and then we settled back to await late afternoon there being nothing better to do to pass the time of day i spent our remaining pound on three bottles of inexpensive but explosive vodka and saw to it that most of the contents were poured down fridays massive and eager gullet when he was properly mummylike in demeanor which is to say stiff as a board i carried him to the back room and wrapped him in the bandages doing his arms and legs separately so hed be more comfortable and leaving just a trio of tiny holes for his nostrils and eyes then since his condition hadnt changed appreciably i had rosepetal help me heft him over to the coffin which was standing upright against a wall we maneuvered him into it and then turned it away from the front window so passersby couldnt get any free looks thanks i panted i couldnt have done it without you thats the whole of it she said dubiously thats all i have to do for a third of the profits almost all i said the rest should be a piece of cake the rest she said quickly what rest here i said withdrawing a small package i had kept in my pocket since returning why dont you go into the back room and change into this what is it she asked your costume i said what costume are you talking about look i said calmly fridays going to bring in all the mummy buffs in the city but lets be honest how the hell many of them can there be your job is to attract those customers who have absolutely no interest in mummies she looked into the bag but theres nothing here she protested just a necklace and a tiny little gstring what do you mean nothing i said sharply ill have you know that necklace alone cost me four shillings but lucifer i cant wear this its indecent a third of the profits i said never i just couldnt must be seven eight thousand people pass here every night i said at three shillings a head be quiet well each get a shilling apiece for every man woman and child who walks through the door she grabbed the bag and stalked off to the back room but i think youre a low despicable con man she yelled back over her shoulder i looked out the window checked the sun and reckoned that it was about a quarter to six so i set up a table with a little cardboard cash box right by the doorway pulled a chair over to it and got ready to unlock the door is anyone out there with you called rosepetal im all alone i said youre sure positive she walked out hesitantly an absolutely gorgeous vision of a fullbreasted narrowwaisted hotblooded egyptian princess she had her hands crossed modestly in front of her and kept peeking around to make sure i hadnt lied to her about being alone i feel not unlike a fool in this getup she said nonsense i said enthusiastically youll outdraw friday fifty to one you bought the gstring in sort of a hurry didnt you said rosepetal i didnt spend long hours agonizing over which one to purchase if thats what you mean i replied staring in rapt attention as she inhaled and kind of fluttered all at the same time thats what i mean she said you know lucifer even if the queens and princesses of ancient egypt walked around in g strings which i for one am inclined to doubt i nonetheless think it very unlikely that their gstrings possessed emblems of buster brown and his dog tyge she spread her hands revealing the problem so well say its young king tut and his pet dog i said quickly wholl know the difference its bad enough that im out here being a barebreasted and bareassed and barewhatevered shill for you she snapped i dont intend to be an object of ridicule as well you just keep on breathing and making muscles like that and i guarantee there aint nobody going to be laughing at you i said devoutly now get in the window and start attracting attention its time to open for business couldnt you at least have gotten one with teddy roosevelt she said taking her place and starting to gyrate for the pedestrians and what about a headdress egyptian queens wore headdresses they also didnt chew gum i said gesturing for her to empty her mouth now lets just concentrate on business so we did and business concentrated right back on rosepetal and friday mostly rosepetal and by seven oclock we had taken in almost five hundred shillings and rosepetal was so tired from shimmying that she forgot all about being embarrassed her body glistened with sweat but i decided not to give her a towel since it looked for all the world like she had anointed herself with various kinds of ancient egyptian oils and love potions and stuff like that and i even added that fact to my spiel we kept up our little show for hours rosepetal wiggling and wriggling me telling the customers what remarkable curiosities they were looking at and friday mummying it up like hed been doing it all his life in fact i was giving serious thought to franchising the operation when a small skinny little englishman with a daintily manicured mustache walked up to me hat in hand and cleared his throat i stopped my complicated explanation of the dance of sublime surrender which rosepetal was right in the middle of and turned to him yes brother i said putting on my best sunday smile what can i do for you i dont mean to interrupt your show he said apologetically or to intrude in matters that are none of my business but just spit it right out brother i told him dont mind interrupting queen cleopatra here shell just put everything into a holding pattern until we can get back to her well i was looking at the mummy of amenophis here said the englishman when the strangest thing happened oh i said and what was that it winked at me a woman in the audience screamed i thought it distinctly odd myself agreed the englishman turning to her it must be your imagination i said smoothly mummies dont wink and even if they did a vigorous manly mummy like this one would wink at her i gestured toward rosepetal long before hed think of winking at you suddenly friday grunted and three women fainted my god hes coming to life cried an egyptian friday shook his head trying to get the tape off his mouth and stared at me blearily frmmx fblimm he said through the bandage hes speaking in the ancient tongue cried a woman the egyptians in the crowd started muttering quick little prayers to amenra just to be on the safe side then friday gingerly moved a hand to his head and a couple of pistols appeared dont waste your bullets men i cried hastily hes already dead with that twothirds of our customers raced for the door the rest just lay quiet and peaceful on the floor where they had fallen friday must have been nursing a pretty large hangover because he just stood there in his coffin moaning and gently rubbing his eyes finally he saw me took a step out of the wooden box and tripped over a couple of bodies falling smackdab on his head with a thud so loud it sounded like unto a gunshot rosepetal ran over to him knelt down on the floor beside him and cradled his head in her lap stroking it gently i got a knife and cut a little tape away from his mouth so he could breathe a mite easier without cutting so much that he couldnt go back to work once we got him back into his box it took him about ten minutes to open his eyes then he stared straight up at rosepetals breasts for another five minutes before he turned his head to me blinked a couple of times and struggled to his feet how are you feeling i asked offering him a cup of vodka ready to go back into your tomb he slapped the cup out of my hand and glowered at me as much as a mummy can glower anyway who are you that dares address amenophis he rumbled i have lain in my crypt for centuries i will not return to it if you think acting like this is going to get you out of playing the mummy friday you got another think coming i snapped now get on back into the coffin before some of these people littering the floor start waking up i grabbed his arm to lead him back but he threw me against the wall with no apparent effort rash mortal he bellowed the person of amenophis is sacrosanct he reached a bandaged hand out for rosepetal come my princess lucifer do something she whispered as he approached her ill do something all right i snapped getting up and dusting myself off ill fire the son of a bitch look at his head she said backing away from him its all bloody maybe he really does think hes amenophis friday caught her and hoisted her over his shoulder lucifer she screamed i noticed that she wasnt so allfired terrorstricken that she didnt think to grab the money and stuff it into her gstring as friday carried her through the doorway and off into the night so i had no choice but to follow them though at a respectful distance we made an interesting sight what with friday wandering aimlessly with his halfnaked princess slung over his shoulder rosepetal frightening everyone away with her screaming and me tagging along in their wake trying to figure out how to stop him if not permanently then at least long enough to get the money back he made a couple of quick turns and i momentarily lost sight of him so i increased my pace as i rounded the second corner i ran headfirst into a policeman excuse me officer i said quite all right he replied beautiful night isnt it i said could be a tad cooler though he responded thoughtfully by the way i know it may sound a little peculiar i said but did a halfcrazed mummy carrying a naked girl happen to pass by here recently as a matter of fact he did said the officer it was most amusing well it might have been a lot of things i said but somehow i never thought of amusing as one of them didnt you hear her calling for help indeed he said smiling and most convincing it was too then why didnt you help her i just assumed they were advertising a new restaurant or nightclub or something said the policeman im afraid not i said a new movie then no you will tell me when im getting warm wont you he asked i know it sounds a bit odd i said but they were exactly what they seemed to be you pr types have a marvelous sense of humor he guffawed tell the truth now was it a new turkish bathhouse i told him he was right bade him goodnight and continued my search alone i must have walked four miles up and down cairos winding streets and back alleys when i finally saw this bandaged figure sitting morosely on the sidewalk his head buried in his hands i approached him kind of cautiously inasmuch as he hadnt been all that friendly since falling on his head he looked up when i got within few yards of him but made no attempt to rise to his feet well i said what do you want mortal he said glumly where is she i demanded gone he moaned what the hell do you mean gone i exploded shes got all our money money he said dazedly what is money money is whats ours that shes run off with i yelled now where the hell is she shes all alone her lithe youthful body exposed to the elements her lithe youthful body can damned well take care of itself just fine i snapped what direction did it run off in he belched you wouldnt know where i could get a fatted calf or something like that would you he asked apologetically ordinarily i would not ask favors of a mere mortal but i havent eaten in more than three thousand years and im hungry first the girl then the food i said she started pounding on my head he said and when i set her down for a moment she ran into the alleyway he pointed to a narrow channel between two buildings then id better get after her right quick i said starting off wait he cried youre not going to leave me here are you i mean everythings changed so much in three thousand years i have dim distant memories of sitting around a campfire eating antelope and gallivanting with nubian maidens im having serious problems adjusting to presentday egypt he looked so unhappy that i finally agreed to let him tag along and off we went in pursuit of his lost love and my lost money gradually the alley turned into a minor street and then a major thoroughfare but it remained just as empty probably because when people got a gander at friday they just naturally remembered that they had urgent business elsewhere we finally came to one house that was all lit up like a christmas tree and since no one answered when we knocked at the door we moseyed around back and found ourselves in the midst of a garden party i could see that friday was likely to prove a considerable social hazard because the second he rounded the corner of the house everyone lit out for the hills except for two bearded men who immediately fell to arguing amongst themselves as to whether he was from the ninth or the eleventh dynasty when friday helpfully put in that he was amenophis iii they both turned on him and told him not to interrupt in matters that he knew nothing about but i am amenophis he protested what the hell do you know about it demanded the smaller of the two men that would date you much too late from the style of your leg bandages youre much more likely to be userkaf or perhaps sahura no said friday firmly im confused about a lot of things but if there is one thing i know with absolute certainty its that im amenophis iii you are are you said the taller one nastily then how come you dont know that amenophis is merely an anglicization of amenhetep thats what i said interjected friday hastily im amen hetep iii i just used amenophis to make it easier for you gentlemen so you think the colossi were set up in your honor do you snarled the smaller man you think youre the guy whos credited with building the temple of amenra at karnak how do i know what ive been credited with said friday ive been away piffle snapped the larger of the two men do you hear me i say piffle youre ninth dynasty and thats all there is to it eleventh protested the smaller man look at the eyeholes age could do that said his companion after all hes at least four thousand years old three thousand said friday petulantly keep out of this they snapped in unison excuse me gentlemen i said stepping forward but may i interrupt you for just a moment are you with the mummy asked the smaller man suspiciously in a manner of speaking i replied is he ninth or eleventh dynasty he asked me brother i never discuss politics religion or egyptian dynasties i said firmly my god said the taller man in shocked amazement what else is there well for one thing theres naked white women i said hes right nodded the smaller man thoughtfully there is that have you happened to see any this evening i persisted any what any naked white women im afraid not said the taller man damn muttered friday im terribly sorry continued the taller man but its really not the sort of thing one might expect to see at a cocktail party for egyptologists mores the pity added the smaller man but why do you ask we seem to have misplaced one i said l didnt know they were that easy to misplace remarked the taller one thoughtfully she was my beloved said friday mournfully ah said the smaller man that would be thi daughter of kallimmasin only if you accept his cockandbull story about being amen hetep pointed out the taller one otherwise shes probably nitaqert nitaqert screamed his colleague impossible youve got the wrong dynasty the wrong wife and the wrong color well their tempers got to flaring up then so friday and i just kind of walked back around to the street and continued on our quest friday was about as happy as a lovelorn mummy can be since he had finally found out his lost loves name but i was getting more depressed with every passing minute because the longer it took to hunt rosepetal down the more likely it was that shed be able to find some clothing and if we couldnt find a naked white woman on the streets of cairo our chances of finding a particular clothed one didnt seem all that promising think friday i said as we walked up and down the avenues where would she be likely to go i have no idea he replied and ill thank you to call me amenhetep or else risk bringing my godly wrath down upon yourself and then it came to me in a flash if i were in rosepetals britches and i had as much dishonestlycomeby money as she did the first thing id want to do would be to leave the country and being a white woman it made sense that shed wait for the next ship out of here where all the white folks did at shepheards hotel i conveyed this line of insightful reasoning to friday who having nothing better to offer by way of suggestions decided to accompany me we reached shepheards which had become a jumping off place for no end of wealthy tourists just as the sun was starting to rise and walked up to the registration desk i dont mean to unduly alarm you sir said the concierge but are you aware of the fact that there is a rather large mummy following you yes i am i said i wonder if i might see your guest register it doesnt bother you he asked what doesnt i asked the mummy not a bit i said if it disturbs you ill have it wait outside that wont be necessary he said in a resigned tone of voice when youve worked this desk as long as i have a mummy can be a pretty trivial thing if you know what i mean i assured him that i knew exactly what he meant and began reading the guest book i dont find the name im looking for here i said at last but the party in question may very well have been traveling incognito has anyone checked in during the past two or three hours would you have in mind a young lady who gave every appearance of having dressed in rather a hurry he asked raising an eyebrow the very person i exclaimed i must say she has a peculiar notion of incognito he remarked id sort of like to surprise her i said with a knowing smile what room is she in im afraid that releasing room numbers is against the rules of the hotel he replied stiffly thats a pity i said stepping aside as friday walked forward and grabbed him around the neck it seems that strangling concierges isnt against any particular rules that govern the behavior of mummies he gurgled friday released him and he slid to the floor behind the counter as we raced to the stairs a moment later we were standing in front of the door to room i knocked twice and heard a familiar voice ask who was there room service i said rosepetal opened the door and i stepped in why lucifer she exclaimed startled what a pleasant surprise she was wearing a sporty brown suit with matching shoes all of which looked mighty expensive i let out a curse the second i saw them just how the hell much did those duds cost you i demanded not that much she said backing away and shoving a small table between us i still had enough left to buy a suitcase and to book passage out of this stupid country you spent it all i screamed all of it well i am fleeing for my life you know she said i have no intention of being here when she let out a little shriek as friday entered the room oh my god she cried hes back my beloved thi he intoned extending his arms and walking slowly toward her i shall take you to wife and together we shall rule my kingdom bring order out of chaos and produce many heirs he still thinks hes amenophis she wailed oh no my love said friday i know now that i am amen hetep your name is friday she said practically crying now leave me alone or ill miss my boat but my beloved thi he said confused can it be that the passing of the eons has dimmed your memory i am the pharaoh of all egypt youre not even an egyptian she said desperately youre a a nubian impossible he scoffed you think not she said walking up to him and avoiding his hand let me try to bring you back to your senses once and for all i positioned myself behind him ready to race out the door if he got violent while rosepetal grabbed the end of a bandage that was coming loose at fridays waist and began unraveling it pretty soon she got the most curious expression on her face and by the time she had unwrapped the tape down to his thighbones she just quit altogether staring kind of strangely at what she had uncovered thus far amenhetep dear she sort of crooned can you ever forgive me for doubting you it is forgotten he intoned graciously and you are still my beloved thi she took one last look and nodded vigorously he reached out and embraced her lucifer she said youll find my ticket lying on the nightstand take it and leave ill do no such thing i said lucifer she said sweetly but firmly if youre still in this room in ten seconds i shall ask amenhetep pharaoh of all egypt to execute you as slowly and painfully as possible i was on my way down the hall in eight seconds flat and i heard the door to room slam shut just as i reached the stairway that was the last i ever saw of rosepetal schultz or friday though she did write me after i had finally established my tabernacle to assure me that there were no hard feelings and that amenhetep had certain virtues that were well worth waiting a mere three thousand years for as for me i wound up in morocco which was as far as rosepetal could afford a ticket for and within a mere fortnight i was holding one of the worlds rarest and most valuable treasures in my hand it was not as you shall see quite as simple as it sounds chapter a redletter scheme casablanca wasnt real popular with tourists and sightseers back in the old days and i was the only passenger to climb down the gangplank when we docked there it was so hot and dirty and grubbylooking that i could tell right off why it didnt rank way up there with the riviera and new orleans and other places of worldwide renown there was a very worriedlooking little man waiting on the pier pacing up and down and working himself into a nervous frenzy i nodded pleasantly and walked past him but a minute later he raced after me and grabbed me by the shoulder i beg your pardon monsieur he said apologetically but was there not perhaps a lovely young lady on the ship with you who also planned to disembark at casablanca none that i know of brother i replied but this is terrible he cried i shared his sentiments especially since i could have used a little company during the voyage but i merely smiled at him and kept walking he was back beside me a moment later her name was mademoiselle rosepetal schultz he said are you sure you did not meet her on the boat rosepetal i repeated why didnt you say so in the first place brother then she is on the ship after all he asked looking mighty relieved no i told him as a matter of fact i used her ticket to get here but this is dreadful he wailed she wired me yesterday that she would be arriving this afternoon something came up very unexpectedly i told him truthfully these things happen but why must they always happen to me he moaned try reading a couple of chapters from the book of david i said soothingly i find it usually settles me down when ive had some bad news he raised an eyebrow you know a lot about the bible he asked the right reverend honorable doctor lucifer jones at your service i said extending my hand would i be correct in assuming that you have no place to stay he asked ive temporarily fallen upon hard times brother i admitted but ive never lost my faith in the good lord who i know will provide for me i stared at him curiously what did you have in mind room board and fifty francs a week he said done brother i cried by the way how much is that in real money well it came to about ten dollars which isnt a hell of a lot unless the economy happens to be in the midst of a depression and since that was exactly the state my personal economy was in i decided to take it unless and until something better turned up my employers name was andre peugeot and in all my born days i never saw a man with more nervous tics and gestures all he would tell me about his place of business was that it was called bousbir and he seemed absolutely flabbergasted when i told him id never heard of it when we arrived i was pretty flabbergasted myself to find that something like the bousbir had escaped my attention because what it was was the biggest whorehouse in the whole wide world at least thats what andre told me all i knew for sure is that it was the biggest one i had ever seen and took up about twice as much space as the banque de casablanca which was right across the street from it we walked through a series of lobbies and lounges each covered with plush carpets and velvet wallpaper and containing as tasty an assortment of finelooking ladies as ever i did see until we finally reached a small room with a single bed and a sink and toilet in the corner your room said andre brother andre i said wed better get a couple of things straight right off the bat im pretty liberal as men of the cloth go so i noticed he said dryly neverthegoddamless i continued there are some things that are specifically frowned upon by the good book the law and various other official governing bodies most of them pertaining to your male customers that i am not prepared to do even for money and especially not for a lousy fifty francs a week i quite understand said andre it is for your unique qualities as a man of god that i have hired you i reckon you could use one around here at that i allowed indeed he agreed it has been one of our greatest needs up to now well brother andre i said ill certainly be glad to bring such comfort as i can to your poor wayward girls in any way that i think will help and uplift them the most i appreciate your offer he replied but i think you misunderstand me it is not my girls who need your spiritual expertise rather it is my customers your customers i repeated why dont they just go to church we sell many things here my friend said andre but perhaps our most precious commodity is fantasy do you begin to understand not really i answered some of our little pageants need how shall i put it a technical adviser brother andre the light is beginning to dawn i said shooting him a great big grin can you do it like shooting fish in a barrel i assured him after all youre asking me to combine my two favorite vocations just leave everything to me and the good lord and im sure well manage to work things out betwixt us which we did at least for a few days but within a week the customers and even the girls were getting a little jaded and began demanding new material and i took to wandering through the bazaars during the afternoons searching for ideas that had nothing to do with cardinals and nuns or black masses or maniacal rabbis or secret chinese fertility ceremonies or any of the other similarly pedestrian productions i had been directing and coaching it was during one such sojourn through the marketplace that i saw a white man who looked vaguely familiar he had his back to me and was browsing at a table about fifty feet away but i couldnt get the thought out of my mind that i knew him from somewhere i stayed right where i was pretending to examine some old pottery until at last he paid for the dates he was munching on and i finally got a look at his face it was erich von horst not wishing to cause a scene in public especially since i didnt speak french or arabic and i had the feeling that no one around there spoke anything else i continued to browse until he left the bazaar then being careful to keep out of sight i followed him for almost a mile until he entered an old dusty rundown hotel i waited five minutes then entered it there was no desk clerk on duty so i reached over the counter grabbed hold of the registration book and began looking at it there was no von horst listed nor even a captain peter clarke but it didnt matter a gentleman named fritz wallensack was the only guest currently in residence i tiptoed up to his room threw the door open and walked in von horst i bellowed you owe me two thousand and forty english pounds why doctor jones he said looking up from his bed where he was lying with his head propped up against the moldy wall how very nice to see you again have you been in casablanca long dont give me that crap von horst i snapped i want my money i dont doubt it he chuckled well i demanded if i had your money or indeed if i had anybodys money do you think id be staying in a place like this he said calmly youre welcome to search the premises of course but i can guarantee that you wont find anything except an exceptionally dirty shirt and a pair of socks with holes in them what about my money it was well spent he assured me with a smile youd have enjoyed every shilling of it had you been in my place i wasnt in your goddamned place well yes i was rather afraid youd look at it that way he sighed just how soon do you intend to make restitution realizing of course that im going to be your constant companion until that happy moment occurs i said as soon as i can work out a few unpleasant details ill be happy to pay you back and with interest said von horst what details i demanded my dear fellow i hope you dont think im in casablanca for my health just what are you doing here i asked suspiciously ive been here for two months working on the biggest deal of my life he said lowering his voice but the casablanca police know who i am and i havent been able to make a move without being watched so here i sit slowly going broke in this grubby hotel less than half a mile away from a fortune that i could retire on and the worst part of it is theres a time limit on the damned operation but sooner or later theyll have to relax their vigil and then his voice trailed off just how much is this deal worth i asked with as much lack of interest as i could muster on the spur of the moment at least fifty thousand pounds he said without hesitation that much he nodded and then he stared at me kind of funnylike for a very long minute i wonder he said softly still looking at me about what i said you know he said more to himself than to me it just might work what might jones he said suddenly forget about what i owe you how would you like to make some real money i imagine i could be coerced into it i admitted good he said but well have to move fast can you be ready to leave the country in two or three hours aint nothing around to stop me i replied well jones he said all businesslike im afraid were going to have to trust each other much as i dislike the thought of it but unfortunately there is no way to avoid giving you the details of the plan all i can do is assure you that such knowledge will do you absolutely no good without me shoot i said three short blocks from here is a small christian mission run by two elderly german sisters and their middleaged nephew inside the mission is a speakers podium on a shelf inside the podium is a copy of the bible he paused for effect jones that bible is a jacobean red letter edition thats something special i asked there were only six printed he said the sisters dont know what it is so stealing it should present no great difficulty but the moment i try to leave the country or even the city im going to be searched six ways to sunday and since i am not known as a religious man sooner or later one of the gendarmes is going to send some telegrams to various religious organizations or antiquarian bookdealers and then the shit will hit the fan he smiled however no one will question a man of god who carries a bible with him you can walk out with it right under their noses sounds good to me brother von horst i said you are probably thinking that once i turn the bible over to you there is nothing to stop you from selling it and reaping the entire profits for yourself he continued such a notion never crossed my mind i protested vigorously while crossing my fingers behind my back well just in case it does let me tell you that fortyeight hours from now i intend to send a letter to the moroccan government telling them what the jacobean red letter bible is and grossly exaggerating how much it is worth they will promptly put out a reward for its return worth considerably more than the book itself and nine dealers out of ten will be more likely to turn you in for the reward than buy the book from you so where are we going to sell it i asked there is an american collector who will be in algiers exactly seven days from now said von horst he knows hell be purchasing stolen goods and is willing to run the risk that entails in exchange for getting possession of the bible you do not know his name and he does not know yours he will buy only from me have we got a deal i nodded and shook his hand on it good he said i will meet you ten minutes after dark here i asked no theyll be watching this place he lowered his head in thought for a moment then looked up do you know where the bousbir is im sure i can find it i replied earnestly first lounge to the right ten minutes after dark he said i returned to the bousbir gave a couple of the girls one last strenuous coaching session and waited for dark von horst showed up on schedule panting like hed been running full speed for a while and thrust a bible into my hands thats it he said dont try to hide it just carry it out in the open and act like it was any other book ill be creating a diversion while you escape with it fine i said tucking it under my arm when and where do we meet on the waterfront in algiers is a tavern known as the fishermans reward today is the ninth of august you must meet me there on the sixteenth of august at precisely onefifteen pm if you come early you may attract undue attention and if youre even five minutes late our buyer may lose his nerve and depart have you a reliable watch not since a little card game i got into in johannesburg i admitted he pulled a beatup gold watch out of his pocket and handed it to me take mine he said and try not to gamble it away whats that little thing dangling from the chain i asked a rabbits foot he answered for luck well i hope it brings me more luck than it brought the rabbit i said i guess i might as well get started now he stuck his head out into the hall then nodded and gestured that it was clear a few minutes later i was on the main road out of town heading toward algeria just as i reached the outskirts of casablanca i heard a lot of shooting and sirens and things behind me but no one bothered me so i kept right on walking i stopped in the city of fez long enough to buy another bible that looked for all the world just like the jacobean red letter edition and made it to the algerian border on the evening of the eleventh the moroccan and algerian border patrols and customs officials searched me up and down and sideways and spent the better part of an hour jabbering about the tooth of a lion or leopard or something which made absolutely no sense to me but they finally let me pass and i bedded down in algeria i hitched a ride on an oxcart into ouahran and spent a considerable portion of the day exploring the scenic wonders of that exotic city which didnt look a whole lot different from casablanca except that it didnt have nothing to compare to the bousbir i stopped at the local library just before closing time found the dustiest most unused bookshelf in the place stuck the jacobean red letter bible up against the wall behind a set of books about french civil law where no one would be able to see it and continued on my way i did a little vigorous preaching the next morning and so amused a tribe of berbers that they fed me and let me ride on horseback with them to the outskirts of algiers where they pitched their tents since i didnt want to show up too early i spent the next couple of days in the berbers camp teaching them a somewhat sporting form of rudimentary statistical analysis having to do with the number twentyone and when i finally took my leave of them i took certain fond gold and paper remembrances with me i arrived on the waterfront just before noon on the appointed day and quickly spotted the fishermans reward a seedylooking dive with a clientele more in need of salvation than most i spent the next hour walking around the area checking von horsts watch every few minutes and practically beating off a steady stream of street urchins who all seemed to be business agents for their older sisters finally at exactly onefourteen i walked into the tavern and took a seat at an empty table in the back von horst arrived about a minute later and joined me have a good trip he asked in low tones no problems i said wheres our buyer he should be here any second said von horst hes already put down some earnest money with a confederate of mine we ordered a couple of beers and waited in silence when no one else had walked in by onethirty von horst went over to the bar and made a quick phone call he came back to the table looking very upset louis blaine has been arrested he said grimly our buyer he nodded the stupid son of a bitch got drunk last night and took a punch at the prefect of police what do we do now i asked starting to feel kind of uneasy around the edges we wait said von horst he ought to be out in a couple of weeks and well try to set up another meeting with him in the meantime well live on his down payment have you got the book with you well as you can imagine i wasnt in any hurry to let von horst spend two weeks examining the particular bible i was toting around so me and the lord held a quick powwow to devise a course of action i dont want to wait i announced at last you know what these jerkwater countries are like he could be in jail for years theres really no alternative von horst replied i wasnt kidding about writing the moroccan government right now that books too hot to try to sell elsewhere well it just dont seem fair that i should be stuck in this hellhole because your buyer went and did something stupid i said after all i fulfilled my part of the bargain i dont know what you expect me to do about it he replied irritably id pay you if i could but i dont have the money youve got the down payment i said how much was that five thousand pounds he answered kind of grudgingly thats more than twice what you stole from me back in dar essalaam i said give it to me and well call things square i just want to get the hell out its a deal he said enthusiastically let me have the bible let me have the money first i said he shrugged pulled an envelope out of his pocket and handed it over to me i opened it thumbed through the wad of bills nodded and stuck it inside my shirt here it is i said pulling the bible out of my shirt and giving it to him i held my breath as he gave it a brief look but it was too dark in the bar for him to notice that it wasnt the red letter edition youre crazy jones he said placing the bible on the table next to his glass within two weeks three at the most hell be out and you could have had twentyfive thousand pounds the good lord frowns on greed i said piously oh i almost forgot he said could i borrow some money from you to get me through to ah why not i said with a smile giving him some of my berber money keep the change thanks he said its a pleasure to do business with you doctor jones same here i said rising and shaking his hand by the way he added do you suppose a rich man like yourself would mind giving me my watch back i chuckled handed it to him and left the tavern the second i got out the door i took off like a bat out of hell for the nearest ticket office booked passage on a boat that was leaving algiers in ten minutes paid for it with my berber winnings so as not to flash the five thousand pounds von horst had given me and raced up the gangplank without being seen as soon as we were safely out to sea i hunted up a deckhand and found out that i was aboard the dying quail bound for the cape after going through gibraltar it wasnt exactly my first choice of destinations but with five thousand pounds in my pocket i wasnt too upset about it and along with the money i still had the red letter edition of the bible which i figured on returning for in a year or two when the gendarmes were a little less sensitive about such things after spending a few minutes walking around the deck convincing everyone that i was perfectly calm and had nothing to hide i went back to my cabin locked the door and pulled out the envelope as i removed the money prior to putting it in orderly stacks and admiring it a little before dinnertime a small folded piece of paper fluttered down to the floor i picked it up opened it and read it as follows th august my dear doctor jones as you may very well have guessed by now there is of course no such thing as a jacobean bible let alone a red letter edition of it i apologize for having fooled you but since you have doubtless hidden it somewhere and substituted another totally worthless bible in its place i must confess that i dont feel quite as guilty as i otherwise might this entire affair began when i first saw you back in casablanca i was under constant surveillance by the local police that much at least was true and i needed an accomplice who could take something out of the country for me you really are not the most observant person i have ever encountered i must have wasted five afternoons in that incredibly boring marketplace before you finally recognized me and even then i almost lost you a couple of times while you were shadowing me back to my hotel if you have read this far you have doubtless figured out that there never was a louis blaine he is of course one of my professional identities and i hereby will him to you to use whenever you wish he was however absolutely essential to the success of this operation for without him you would have had no reason to show up at precisely onefifteen and thus i would have had no reason to give you my watch hidden in the rabbits foot is the lions tooth the largest and most valuable diamond in africa i thank you for delivering it in such excellent condition if you are reading this for the first time i must assume that you have not yet spent any of the five thousand pounds i allowed you to swindle me out of my advice to you is that if you must spend them you do so very carefully as the print job is of an inferior grade and they are worth if anything even less than the bible your obedient servant erich von horst about ten seconds after i put the letter down i got violently seasick for the first time in my life chapter mutiny the dying quail didnt have much in the way of a passenger list but on the other hand the dying quail wasnt all that much of a ship so things kind of worked out even i had heard that shipboard romances could be really memorable occurrences but the only person who i could find on deck at night was a wrinkled old dermatologist from korea who spent the better part of a week trying to convince me that contrary to popular belief the earth was really flat or at the very least built along the lines of a gently pitched roof the food was okay if you liked tuna it was absolutely terrible if you didnt i didnt and by the third or fourth day out of port i dont think anybody else did either there was an elderly english couple who had just bought a cattle farm in the transvaal area and spent most of their time fighting about whether to butcher them all on the spot or maybe get a little milk from them first there was a scrawny blond swede who never left his cabin except to eat tuna and then get rid of it over the side of the boat there was a trio of german girls round and firm and much too fully packed who didnt speak a word of any civilized tongue and spent all their time taking pictures not that the water off the ivory coast looked all that different from the water next to liberia there were a couple of east indian men who would strip off all their clothes every morning sit in the blazing sun all day with their legs crossed kind of painfullike tell everybody not to eat hamburgers and then go back to their rooms as soon as it was dark we had a downonhisluck actor from canada who kept reciting the more obscure soliloquies from troilus and cressida and a writer from paraguay who drank in most of his local color from a bottle of scotch and finally we had a stunningly beautiful belly dancer from greece who apologized for distracting us but explained that she had to sunbathe in the nude because her audiences didnt like to see different shadings where various straps had been watching her body get an even tan was about as quickmoving a spectator sport as watching paint dry but it did hold certain advantages over paintwatching when viewed in all of its many aspects and it provided me with just about my only form of diversion during the first week of the voyage the captain and the crew were nominally british but i dont think more than half of them had ever gotten to within five hundred miles of london or liverpool the rest were swarthy unwashed seamen who swore in slavic tongues and spent a lot of time glaring sullenly at the passengers who either ignored them or lectured them on the evils of eating beef the captain himself was a jovial balding little man with a red mustache white knee length shorts a huge belly and a driving urge for perfection that caused him to tell a joke thirty or forty times until he got it right it was on our eighth day out of algiers that the captain whose name was roberts announced that he was sick and tired of talking to the crew and would be interested in picking up the gauntlet of any passenger who might care to challenge him to a game or two of chance well the indians probably couldnt have uncrossed their legs even if theyd wanted to and the belly dancer was busy soaking up the sun and the writer was too drunk and the german girls couldnt understand him and most of the other passengers were otherwise occupied which meant that a few minutes later captain roberts and i were sitting across a table from one another mano a mano preparing for a little contest of skill involving a small stack of colorful pasteboards the good lord must have had his attention diverted elsewhere probably he was making sure that the belly dancer got tan everywhere she wanted to for which i couldnt blame him none because he wasnt breathing hard over my shoulder i lost almost three thousand pounds the only saving grace being that the money itself probably wasnt worth a whole lot more than the cards captain roberts didnt seem to notice the difference in the notes though or else he may have decided that it was simply a normal variation because he pocketed the money and announced to passengers and crew alike that he was now at peace with the world and would be breaking out a case of his secondfinest drinking stuff for dinner at no extra cost or at most a very nominal one i think it would be a fair assessment to say that we all enjoyed the evening meal everyone partook heavily of the captains liquor it being the only alternative to eating still more tuna after the last bottle was drained and the belly dancer had gone off with the actor and the three german girls were getting kind of chummy with the crew and the writer and the korean dermatologist were coming close to blows about whether the world was flat or merely slanted those of us who remained finally bade each other a fond goodnight and went off to our various cabins i woke up with a start a couple of hours later when i heard a scream and a splash in quick succession it took me just a minute to climb into my duds and get out on deck where i found a couple of the english crewmen looking over the side of the boat good evening brothers i said either of you two hear something sort of unusual in the last couple of minutes cant say as to how we have sir said one of them help cried a voice that seemed to be coming from a considerable distance away there it is again i said you sure you dont hear something strange thats just captain roberts hollering for help sir said the second crewman soothingly nothing peculiar about that at all seeing as how we dumped him overboard and left him in our wake do you fellows have any special reason for what on the surface of it seems an act sadly lacking in christian charity i asked them reason enough snapped the first crewman we all got together for a little game of cards after the party broke up and he wound up the big loser so i asked the blighter paid us off with bogus money said the crewman no i exclaimed and he seemed like such a nice friendly fellow when i played with him this afternoon did you win or lose sir oh i won a couple of thousand pounds i said pulling out the last of von horsts money and handing it over to them is it any good maybe for lighting cigars with said one of them disgustedly certainly not for spending im sorry to be the one to tell you sir dangblast it i swore bitterly and he appeared to be such a decent christian sort of man if you know what i mean seems a shame to drown him oh he isnt going to drown sir said one of the crewmen he aint i said startled why the hell not we tossed him a couple of life preservers and were only a mile off the coast hell make it ashore all right but he definitely wont be coming back aboard ship i asked no sir serves you right you scoundrel i cried shaking my fist over the side of the ship thatll teach you to cheat a man of god being as how youre a man of god and all sir said one of the crewmen i wonder if you could help us with a slight moral dilemma in which we find ourselves certainly my good man i said what seems to be the problem while we dont feel particularly mutinous he began what we done could be misconstrued as mutiny by certain admiralty courts and various other powers of the high seas and youd like me to testify on your behalf is that it i asked oh no sir said the other we wouldnt dream of imposing upon you like that what exactly do you want me to do then i asked well sir said the first crewman it would go very hard with us very hard indeed sir if it looked like we tossed old captain roberts overboard so that we could wrest control of the ship from him to seize power as it were yeah i can see where that might put a little crimp or two in your defense i agreed so we was wondering sir if youd be good enough to take over as captain until we get to the cape me i exclaimed not to worry sir he said well run the ship for you and do the navigation and feed the customers provided they like tuna and keep the decks scrubbed down and make sure everything is shipshape but what with you being a man of god and all it wont go so hard on us when captain roberts finally reaches civilization and institutes legal action against us which he may never do added the other it being such a dark and moonless night he could hardly be sure who it was that pushed him overboard or he could die of pneumonia or of being et by sharks or any one of a number of similar tragedies could befall him sir sad agreed the first crewman nodding his head indeed said the second ill do it i said at last after all while i been captain of my own soul on its long and heartrending journey through life i aint never been captain of a ship before i might just learn something also noted the first crewman the captain gets to eat steak that little fact aint exactly escaped my attention i said with a smile well as long as i got you two to thank i guess youll be serving as my executive officers what are your names call me ishmael said the first ishmael bledsoe and im luthor christian replied the second fine i said and you can call me captain jones well be happy to captain jones sir said ishmael but there may be some amongst our crew the rowdier elements you understand who may not be so inclined well incline em against the mainmast for a few days i said that ought to assuage their doubts i regret to point out that we dont have a mainmast captain jones said luthor apologetically some of them continued lshmael might even wonder what right we had to throw captain roberts overboard them not being acquainted with the concept of personal honor and paying ones debts with legal tender and other such rarefied philosophic points no problem at all i said after a moments thought mr christian yes sir give the signal to abandon ship i said youre the captain he shrugged and went off to the bridge a moment later a loud raucous siren had awakened everyone on board why dont you go make sure everyone has a life preserver i suggested to ishmael and in keeping with our personal code of honor we three will go down with the ship he started passing out a batch of little white inner tubes and within ten minutes everyone except ishmael luthor and me was in the water i picked up a megaphone and held it just in front of my lips good evening i called out this is your new captain lucifer jones speaking i just want you all to know that this has been one of the better abandonship drills that it has ever been my privilege to witness i waited for the screams of outrage to die down a little and then continued i am afraid that poor captain roberts found it necessary to abrogate his command his last wish was that i take over and make sure that the dying quail completed its voyage in perfect safety he felt that as a man of god i was unquestionably the best qualified among all of us to deal with such problems as might arise those of you who share his opinion will be allowed back on board the rest of you are advised not to splash too violently as that constitutes just the kind of motion that attracts sharks a couple of sharks providentially appeared just then and within less than three minutes everyone was back on board and i was unanimously acknowledged as the one and only lawful captain by grace of god and his denizens of the deep well things went pretty smoothly for the next couple of days much to my surprise nobody seemed to care who was captain as long as they all got to where they were going and when they heard about how captain roberts had reneged on his debts of honor they actually gave ishmael and luthor a standing ovation we passed nigeria and cameroon without any untoward incidents then one morning i strolled out on deck at about noon having arisen early and got the shock of my life usually we traveled about a mile off the coast to avoid reefs and other menaces to navigation but now there was a forest about sixty yards off to the left and as if that werent enough there was another one half a mile away on the right mr christian i bellowed sir said luthor arriving a few seconds later mr christian i said unless the ocean has gotten an awful lot narrower or the ship has gotten an awful lot wider i am forced to the conclusion that we are no longer on course you noticed sir said luthor noncommittally of course i noticed i yelled little things like losing the atlantic ocean dont easily escape my attention now where the hell are we i should have thought that would be obvious captain jones replied luthor were on the congo river what the hell are we doing here i persisted some of our crew members threatened to go on a sitdown strike if they had to keep eating tuna said luthor mostly the slavs sir very few of the blueblooded englishmen is that all i said relieved just flog em and lets get back on course my very thought said luthor but we do have one little problem sir dont worry about legalities my good man i said a captains word is law onboard ship that goes without saying agreed luthor oh then whats the problem i asked him there are a lot more of them than there are of us and theyre bigger yeah i can see where that does pose a bit of a problem i agreed also no one whos been eating the tuna right along is in any condition for so strenuous an activity as flogging people even if the crewmen would stand still for it that being the case mr christian i said it is my firm conclusion that we should seek out a river and put the ship into it weve done that sir he said good i said next equip a party of slavic crewmen and send them out to hunt up some meat theyre doing that right now sir he said i couldnt think of any more executive orders so i dismissed him and took a couple of minutes to examine our surroundings we had veered a bit closer to the shore and i could see that it was all covered by trees and vines it looked hot and full of bugs and i sure didnt envy the poor men who had to go hunting in there everything looked green and damp which kind of matched the color and texture of the hundred or so crocodiles that were milling around casting hungry glances up toward the boat every now and then theyd swim a little too close to a hippo which sort of reminded me of the dutchman except that it didnt wear a soiled white suit and the hippo would just bite one of the crocs in half it didnt seem to bother the crocodiles friends and relations none but i noticed that whenever this happened they all kind of moved downstream a little anyway i got a little tired of looking at all these reptiles and river horses after a while so i took out captain robertss fishing rod and decided to bag a couple of trout or whatever but all i kept hooking was crocodiles so i finally gave it up and went back to my cabin to wait for the hunting party to return which they did toward late afternoon and on the run i burst out of my door as soon as i heard the rifle shots ten crew members were racing for the dying quail as fast as their lifeboat could go and behind them in hot pursuit were half a dozen war canoes filled with black savages who were waving spears and shooting arrows in their wake ishmael raced to the bridge and saluted what do you want us to do captain jones sir he said i havent made up my mind yet i said squinting at the lifeboat can you see if they actually caught any meat too hard to tell from here said ishmael well i suppose its our duty to protect em i said fire a broadside at the canoes im afraid thats quite impossible sir said ishmael what the hells the good of being captain if i cant fire a broadside into an enemy every now and then as the mood takes me i said ducking as a couple of arrows flew overhead first of all were facing the wrong way to fire a broadside said ishmael then turn us around i commanded and second of all he continued unperturbed we dont have any weapons why the hell not i demanded this is a passenger ship not a destroyer he replied ducking another arrow there were only four rifles on board and all of them are with the hunting party well just what have we got i asked sidestepping a colorful spear that just missed beheading me theres a rather wickedlooking butchers knife in the kitchen he suggested and ive heard the actor bragging about his skill at fisticuffs and thats our total offensive and defensive weaponry i asked he nodded then wait until our party is back on the ship and lets get make tracks out of here i said the hunting party was on deck within thirty seconds and ishmael gave the order to turn the ship degrees and then proceed at full speed the natives increased the intensity of their attack and began making very rude sounds when they saw we were hightailing it for the open sea shoal ahead sir cried luthor ishmael stood at the wheel which had about a dozen arrows embedded in it and steered shoal to starborad sir cried luthor ishmael ducked a spear and two more arrows and kept steering suddenly there was a terrible crunching sound shoal beneath sir said luthor i dont suppose were prepared to repel boarders i asked as ishmael tried to steer the ship and found out that the wheel wouldnt move were mostly a pleasure ship sir he said sadly maybe if we threw some beads at them or offered them the belly dancer millions for defense but not one cent for tribute i bellowed mostly because beads hadnt accomplished all that much good with the last few tribes i had encountered and i had other plans in mind for the belly dancer oh very well said sir cried ishmael words to die for who said anything about dying i replied have we at least got a flare gun aboard so we can see them better he walked to a nearby cabinet and pulled one out i took it from him and fired it illuminating the sky with redgold streaks of light suddenly all the savages started screaming in terror and a minute later they were prostrating themselves in their boats a difficult feat of balance even if there hadnt been a couple hundred crocodiles in the water i think the flares have convinced them were some kind of gods sir said ishmael we i repeated i dont recollect anyone else firing the flares i think the flares have convinced them that youre some kind of god sir amended ishmael i think you may have something there i said why dont you and luthor figure out how to get us off this damned shoal while theyre busy worshiping me he and luthor hopped to it and after about an hour of rocking and lurching i heard another crunch and suddenly we were moving through the water again the cheer let out by the crew and passengers was drowned out by the cheer from the savages who began paddling along in our wake they were still following us when we hit the ocean and turned left from time to time one of them would spear a fish and throw it onto our deck as a small tribute but for the most part they were content to worship me from afar the hunting party hadnt managed to bring back any fresh meat in fact their first shot had winged one of the natives and precipitated the whole affair of the previous evening it didnt matter much anyhow they were so bitten up by bugs that they probably wouldnt have had much stomach for good red meat any time before we hit the cape i posted a new ships regulation to the effect that sunbathing was now allowed only on the captains private deck unfortunately the belly dancer decided that she was tan enough and i kept stumbling over the two east indians every time i went into and out of my cabin until i rescinded the order a couple of days later we had no more serious problems until we were almost south of portuguese west africa at which point our korean dermatologist borrowed one of the rifles lashed himself to the wheel and explained that while he had nothing against us personally we nonetheless had to turn the ship around before we sailed over the edge of the world i signaled luthor and ishmael to leave me alone on the bridge with him and the two of us got to talking about one thing and another and had a friendly little drink to pass the time of day and i finally convinced him that the edge of the world was somewhere around brussels and actually we were going uphill and toward safety he was one very happy korean for the rest of the trip and hardly bothered anyone at all except for our drunken writer who was convinced that the edge of the world was more in the neighborhood of lincoln nebraska one day when we had gotten to within a couple of hundred miles of the cape the savages who were still behind us and still tossing us an occasional fish or eel began screaming at the tops of their lungs whats the problem now i said coming out of my cabin where i had been thinking of ways to convince the belly dancer that her tan was fading whales off the starboard bow sir said luthor i looked and sure enough there were about twenty of the beasts making toward the ship flopping and splashing and spraying up huge geysers of water from the tops of their noses and otherwise looking very ominous does this kind of thing happen very often mr christian i asked him looking about for the nearest life preserver well that all depends captain jones sir he said on what i asked on whether were in port or not sir he replied were on the high seas i pointed out to him well that does make it more likely sir he agreed what do you do when they attack the ship i asked personally i close my eyes very tightly and pray that theyll go away said luthor with obvious sincerity i suppose rifle bullets would just enrage them i asked i really have no idea said luthor you can certainly try rifle bullets if you wish personally i think im going to go below and grab a little nap he raced off before i could order him to remain on duty the whales got to within two hundred yards and our faithful natives suddenly unconverted and headed back toward the mouth of the congo river some two thousand miles north of us the whales ignored them and drew even closer they look hungry said ishmael who had suddenly appeared at my side you ever seen a whale that didnt i asked out of curiosity once he admitted of course it was dead of course i said one of the whales got to within about twenty yards and i threw a sextant at it it bounced off its nose without causing any injury that i could see do whales eat people i asked i imagine whales eat pretty much what they want to said ishmael drawing closer as if for comfort i mean maybe theyll go away and leave us alone i said hopefully maybe he said doubtfully and maybe i said struck by a sudden flash of inspiration theyre just here to beg at the table what are you talking about captain jones said ishmael go down to the kitchen and bring up some of our tuna i said urgently maybe if we give em some scraps theyll leave us alone he shrugged raced down to the kitchen and came up with a couple of kegs of tuna one under each arm we waited until two of the whales were so close we could have reached out and touched them then threw the tuna into their gaping mouths then we stood back to see if we had guessed right and the strangest thing happened their eyes went wide and began watering one of them started coughing and heaving and the other just rolled right on its back bellyup which certainly agreed with my own assessment of the tuna in the first place the other whales took one look at their companions then left as soon as ishmael got some more tuna and began throwing it at them not too much happened after that at least so far as whales and savages were concerned ishmael told me that the slavs were getting ready to take over the ship if we didnt start feeding them meat but i figured that we were only a few days out of port and there wasnt much sense stopping to find a source of meat this close to the end of our little voyage then when we were just one day out of cape horn the belly dancer approached me and asked if in my dual capacity as captain of the dying quail and a man of the cloth i could perform marriages onboard the ship there was a little confusion just then since i began explaining that i could consummate marriages with the best of them but we finally got things straightened out and that evening after dinner i pronounced her and the actor man and wife the sentences to run concurrently that was very well done sir said luthor stopping by my table after the ceremony oh indeed it was sir agreed ishmael joining him well thank you very much brothers i said always happy to oblige young love in bloom we were rather hoping youd feel that way about it sir said luthor im not sure i follow you i said you may not have noticed it sir said ishmael but young love has been blooming all over the whole ruddy boat another marriage i said bring em up here in front of me and ill have em hitched in no time well this one is a bit irregular said ishmael leaning over and whispering in my ear i agreed as how it was a mite out of the ordinary but once we got to haggling in earnest i found that fifty pounds was more than enough to assuage my conscience and eliminate any hint of irregularity and an hour after the first ceremony i married the three german girls to ishmael luthor and three of their shipmates the man on watch called out that cape horn was within sight and yet another couple decided that if they were ever going to get married they would probably find less social opposition here than elsewhere fifty more pounds changed hands and a few moments later i joined kim li sang the korean dermatologist to eduardo duarte the paraguayan writer i made sure that there were no more weddings in the near offing then called ishmael and luthor up from their rather crowded bridal bower luthor had a black eye and ishmael was missing a tooth what the hell happened i asked we had our first lovers tiff said ishmael spitting a little blood over the railing you ought to see the other six added luthor later perhaps i said ive called you here for something a little more important and what might that be sir asked luthor do the slavs still want to take over the ship indeed they do sir said ishmael good i said why dont you give me just enough time to move my gear out of captain robertss quarters and then tell them the ship is all theirs when the ship docked the next morning there was a welcoming committee waiting for us led by captain roberts himself evidently he had been fished out of the ocean by a passing cargo ship which not bothering to explore the congo river and its environs had beaten us to the cape by almost a full day the slavs who by this time had moved lock stock and barrel into the captains quarters were jailed as mutineers pending the outcome of an admiralty inquiry while ishmael bledsoe and luthor christian were given citations of commendation for getting the dying quail into port only a day late and were exonerated of all wrongdoing not directly connected with their wedding the last i saw of them they were sneaking off to parts unknown with the rest of their newlymade little family just as a slavic translator arrived on the scene as for me i had one hundred crisp british pounds in my pocket and having had my fill of the sea i set off once again in search of the fortune that would finally result in the building of the tabernacle of saint luke chapter an affair of the heart cape town didnt appear all that promising a place for the excaptain of the dying quail to settle down especially once captain roberts figured out why hed been tossed overboard and started looking for me with a gun so i took my leave one fine morning at about two oclock and headed on up the eastern coastline my money held out just fine until i got to durban which had a mule track horses being too expensive for that part of the country i picked out a likelylooking one named saint andrew placed my money down and watched him go into the final turn leading by two lengths when a pride of lions raced out of the veldt and attacked the field the jockeys most of whom were faster than their mounts anyway jumped off and raced to safety but none of the mules made it as far as the homestretch the track claiming that this was an act of god refused to refund the bets even though i representing god pointed out that what it mostly was was an act of lions i could see we were likely to be arguing all day without solving anything so i took the rest of my money and tried to put it all on a large blackmaned lion who was just finishing off saint andrew the track officials explained that it was against policy to make book on lions and besides they wouldnt give me more than threetofive on the blackmaned one we did some real quick haggling amongst ourselves and finally they laid ninetoten against my lion with no place or show betting as soon as i put up my money the lion got up yawned stretched and ambled back into the bush off the course foul cried the steward disqualified and placed last how come you didnt disqualify him for eating saint andrew i demanded my dear sir said the steward in a patronizing voice he ran straight and true after saint andrew im afraid i dont follow you brother i said there is nothing in the rules about one participant eating another he continued but it clearly states that leaving the course is a foul am i to understand brother i said that you have no intention of refunding either of my bets he nodded whos in charge here i demanded i want to see the owner the owner is mrs emily perrison said the steward but you wont find her here she detests gambling then why the hell does she own a racetrack i asked for the same reason she owns almost everything else in this town her husband died and left it to her a widow you say is she young old enough to be your mother replied the steward and crazy as all getout gives away most of her money to religious missions up north of here where in particular i asked like i told you up north the whole worlds up north i pointed out i dont know ethiopia chad the sudan somewhere up there how would i find this mrs perrison i asked i cant give out her address he said but if youll just walk north and east you cant miss it i left both the racetrack and my hundred pounds behind me without a second thought i had a few shiilings left in my pocket and i spent them on a shave and a little hair grease after which i started walking to the northeast the steward hadnt been kidding about not being able to miss my destination because i soon passed in rapid succession perrisons dry goods perrisons general store perrisons slaughterhouse and restaurant and the perrison daily press when i finally reached the long roadway leading to the perrison homestead it was twilight and it was dark by the time i walked up to the huge old wooden farmhouse i spent a couple of minutes smoothing down my hair brushing the dust off my clothes and making sure the good book was prominently displayed then knocked on the door it was opened a moment later by a fat young man with a sullen face and piggy little eyes what do you want he whined greetings i said pleasantly is emily perrison at home who wants to know he asked picking on a pimple what do you mean who wants to know i said i want to know who are you he asked rubbing his stubby little nose i am doctor lucifer jones i said forcing a friendly smile my mum dont need a doctor he said sullenly im not that kind of doctor i said why not get your mother and let her decide he grunted slammed the door in my face and left me standing out there in the cold a minute passed then another and finally the door opened again and i found myself facing mrs emily perrison she was the pinkest woman i ever did see she wore her hair up in a bun and her face and body looked like someone was trying to balance a small balloon atop a bigger one she had blue eyes a broad nose and lots of shiny white teeth and she looked like she would never walk when she could mince she reached out a ruffled arm and took my hand in hers doctor jones the right reverend doctor lucifer jones i said stooping over and kissing her fingers they tasted of bread dough and it reminded me that i hadnt eaten all day im back from your mission in ethiopia to report on all the good work weve been doing with the money you so generously sent to us but i made no contributions to ethiopia she said looking puzzled well they told me i was in ethiopia but it could have been chad i do make donations to a number of missions in chad she said and right appreciative we are i said quickly it would just melt your heart to see all those little heathen children coming to church and singing hymns of a sunday morning her face lit up at that and she invited me into the living room which had a flock of overstuffed victorian chairs and loveseats covered by hundreds of little doilies there were a batch of paintings on the wall mostly of flowers and apples and stuff like that but they didnt hold a candle to the painting of nellie willoughby in the altogether that hung over the bar in the new stanley hotel by the way who was that who met me at the door i asked that was my son horace she said apologetically a right charming lad he is i said quickly well doctor jones she said with a fluttery little sigh ive heard horace called a good many things but thats the very first time the word charming has ever been mentioned all he needs is a little firm guidance from a godfearing stepfather not unlike myself and hell be right as rain im glad you agree she said agree with who and about what i asked with me about horace ive recently allowed a certain gentleman to come calling mainly because i too feel that the boy needs a father that wasnt exactly the solution i had in mind but i just smiled and allowed as to how id like to meet such a lucky fellow before going back into the bush for another couple of quick rounds with satan she told me that i was in luck because he was coming over for dinner that very night then she got me some tea and started asking about the natives in chad i told her whatever sounded likely embellishing a little bit here and there about their fertility rites and other such rituals and explaining that it was due to her and her alone that these sinful goingson had been stopped suddenly she reached out grabbed my hand and held it against her bosom which was considerable when at rest but was throbbing to beat the band right then it must have been terribly difficult for a cultured gentleman like yourself to rub shoulders with such savages she said somebody had to do it i said nobly and what christian wouldnt gladly accept a little torture and some tropical diseases if it enabled him to spread the word i shot her my saddest most tragic smile and while i may have missed the companionship of a good christian white woman during all them painful years i couldnt have afforded to keep a wife or raise a family anyway what with donating all my money to various leper colonies you poor dear she breathed youre penniless i nodded but i aint complaining maam i said quickly ive got spiritual riches and thats something i wouldnt trade with no one where did you plan to spend the night she asked i saw a real comfortablelooking bench behind the slaughterhouse i said and im sure in a week or two i can get used to the smell i wont hear of it she exclaimed youll stay right here in the house as our guest until youre ready to go out and do the lords work again but maam i protested it just aint right besides i still get nightmares from the time they strung me up and tried to make me renounce jesus you wouldnt want to wake up during all that screaming i mean i know you feel deeply obligated because ive undergone all this suffering and privation for your pet charities but youre staying and thats that she said firmly i explained that it was morally wrong but that i was too weak and exhausted to argue with her anymore so id have to abide by her decision she was just reaching out to grab my face and press it on her bosom right next to my hand and i took a deep breath on the assumption that there wasnt a lot of extra room there for air or anything else when we were interrupted by a brisk knocking at the front door she stood up slightly flushed and looking pinker than ever and walked to the door a moment later she returned with a familiar figure who was dressed all in black shirt tie vest suit socks shoes hat belt probably even underwear doctor jones said emily id like to introduce you to my gentleman caller major theodore dobbins late of his majestys armed forces im not sure which of us looked more surprised but he recovered first and extended his hand my dear doctor jones he said how good it is to see you again you two know each other asked emily weve done a little missionary work together i said in fact i think you could fairly say that the last time we got together we prevented a few hundred poor lost souls from becoming drug addicts praise god she cried looking all sort of uplifted its been a long time doctor jones said the major seating himself on one of the uglier chairs i had never expected to see you again isnt it a small world said emily crowded is more the word for it i replied well ill leave you two to discuss old times while i check on dinner she said scurrying out to the kitchen what are you doing here major dobbins hissed as soon as she was out of earshot just spreading the word of the lord i replied and yourself you will doubtless find this difficult to comprehend he said but i am here because of an earnest affair of the heart difficult aint exactly the word id choose brother dobbins i said how much is she worth what makes you think id know anything about her financial status he said with dignity i assure you my friend that such a question has never crossed my mind that much i said my dear doctor jones he said sitting down opposite me i think it best that we lay all our cards on the table after our unfortunate meeting with erich von horst in daressalaam certain business interests caused me to move my base of operations to south africa in some degree of haste they issued another warrant for you i asked let us say that my interpretations of the finer points of the law differed in various respects from those of the authorities he replied be that as it may i found that i had insufficient capital to continue dealing in those perishable goods that had formed the staple of my livelihood for the past decade indeed all seemed hopeless until i heard of the good mrs perrison from an associate and immediately moved my base once again this time to durban i will confess that she does indeed possess a certain amount of wealth though doubtless far less than you hope or suspect i have been courting her assiduously for the past two months and now stand upon the brink of being able to set the time and place for our nuptials it certainly beats leaving it all to horace i said thoughtfully i knew you would appreciate my position he said with a smile i do more than appreciate it major i replied i envy it and so we come to the crux of the situation he said exactly how much will it take to assuage your envy i sure wouldnt want to appear greedy or nothing i told him but i got a feeling that it would take more than youre willing to spend two thousand pounds he offered come on now major i said i walked by all those stores on the way up here they all have mortgages he replied two thousand is a generous offer doctor jones i never denied it i said of course it stands to reason that if two thousand is a generous offer ten thousand is five times as generous that is simply out of the question he said lets split it right down the middle twentyfive hundred pounds i shook my head well major it looks like were going to be rivals for that poor lonesome widow ladys hand may the best man win so long as he aint an englishman with a price on his head emily rejoined us just then to inform us that dinner was on the table and we followed her into the dining room which like the living room was furnished with a batch of ugly victorian items in this case a china cabinet with a matching table and four dumpy chairs horace was sitting on one of the chairs picking his nose thoughtfully and the major and i sat down at the head and foot of the table emily joined us a few seconds later im sure you gentlemen had lots to talk about said emily more than you could imagine i assured her have you known each other long she asked oh we go way back maam i said of course major dobbins goes a lot farther back than i do me being a young and vital godfearing christian gentleman in the very prime of life my dear doctor jones you must learn not to feel so self conscious about your unworldliness and lack of experience said the major after all immaturity is nothing to be ashamed of youll undoubtedly outgrow it at about the same time horace does with that horace got up from the table and stalked out of the room have i said something to offend him asked the major with a certain degree of satisfaction hes a very sensitive boy emily replied i could tell that right off the bat i interjected hes still trying to find himself she confided has he tried looking in the kitchen i asked i mean if i wanted to find horace thats the very first place id look for him you must excuse my friend said the major im sure he doesnt mean to appear so boorish but i must also point out that it is this very insensitivity that precludes his ever successfully raising a child just because youve been littering africa with children dont give you no monopoly on fatherly wisdom i shot back i could raise horace as well as the next man especially if the next man was you im afraid i dont follow what all this is about said emily miss emily i said i got to declare myself here and now ive lost my heart to the radiance of your beauty and want nothing more than to be a husband to you and a good father to horace teaching him the manly art of selfdefense and taking him to rugby games of a sunday afternoon this is so sudden she said blushing but what about the major he can go out and preach the word amongst the heathen like i been doing i said it might do him a world of good ill need time to think about this said emily my dear i urge you not to listen to him said the major if nothing else think of horace doctor jones is probably even now wanted in some municipality or another for pederasty thats a lie i shouted i aint never pretended to be a foot doctor in my life miss emily i put it to you the only person at this table who has ever been arrested is the major is that true theodore she asked it was a very trivial matter my dear he said thats what all them naked ladies said too emily perrison gasped and covered her face with her hands by gad sir i will not be subjected to any further vilifications roared the major honor demands satisfaction that brought back memories of a lovely young girl i used to know back in the states named honor weinburger but before i could share this drollery with them the major was on his feet pacing back and forth and thumping his fist into his palm well meet at dawn he said at last jones choose your weapon how about silence at five hundred paces i suggested when i saw he was serious you could start now pistols said the major pistols at the count of ten this is silly major i said i aint never fired a pistol in my life and you aint never made close friends with anyone who could count all the way up to ten humbug cried the major youre trying to make a farce out of this just to hide your cowardice and youre trying to make a duel out of it because you know you aint got a chance next to a handsome young buck like me i said begging your pardon for being so immodest and truthful maam may i say something asked emily who had been looking more and more upset im afraid not my dear said the major this is an affaire dhonneur now but what if i dont want to marry the winner she said thats absolutely unheard of snapped major dobbins i got to agree with the major i said if i actually get around to risking my life for your hand id just naturally expect the rest of you to come with it its my hand she pointed out but its our duel replied the major women simply dont understand these things now just a minute said emily hotly madame i love you with a mad undying passion that admits of no doubt or weakness said the major placing a hand to his heart and i cannot in good conscience allow this scoundrel to turn your head and destroy your chance for happiness to say nothing of the detrimental influence he would have on young horace of whom i could not be more fond if he were my own son i must confess that i shared his sentiments about horace and would have been hard pressed to name a situation that could have made me any fonder of him either especially if he were my own son well miss emily kind of softened when she heard the majors declaration of love and high purpose which forced me to make a similar one and she finally agreed as to how sometimes affairs of honor were kind of honorable but i do have one small request theodore she said whatever you wish my dear he replied smoothly could you fight your duel at noon instead of sunrise certainly he said but why i thought we might hold it at the racetrack and charge a little something extra for admission the missions in chad and the sudan could surely use the money and somehow all this wont seem so futile if it serves a good purpose ah what a rare treasure one of us is going to be marrying eh smiled the major true i agreed and what a lovely woman comes with it the major harrumphed a couple of times and then got to his feet excuse me one and all but i think id best be returning to my apartments he announced but its only eight oclock protested emily in hurt tones true he acknowledged but i plan to have a hard day of butchery and bloodletting tomorrow and i do that sort of thing best after a good nights sleep why not come along with me doctor jones we can toast one anothers good if brief health a few times and you wont be besmirching our dearly beloved ladys reputation by spending the night here without a chaperone id like to oblige you major i said but someone ought to stay here to protect our fragile flower from jungle beasts and other night critters dont feel badly about not thinking of it yourself though its the kind of thought that would only occur to a decent and dedicated young missionary he glared at me for a couple of minutes then turned on his heel and left by the time emily and i got back to the dining room we found horace sitting at the table working on his fourth piece of pie you gonna fight for my mum he asked between mouthfuls it sure appears that thats the course the lord has in mind for me i said will you be rooting for me horace dont know he said downing a quart of milk in a single swallow have to see the morning line first horace said emily just boyish enthusiasm i said tousling his hair and dislodging a couple of flies in the process hell outgrow it if he lives long enough we went out to the parlor and had a sip or two of brandy and then i was shown to my room it seemed that my head had hardly hit the pillow before horace was shaking me and telling me to hurry up or else id be late for the duel well they cant start without me i muttered sitting up on the bed i laid twenty shillings on the major at onetotwo said horace and i dont win if you forfeit i thanked the little ghoul for his concern dressed as quickly as i could and walked down to the kitchen where emily was frying up some eggs no time for eating mum cried horace grabbing my arm and dragging me to the door were late but said emily were late repeated horace almost in a panic she sighed shrugged and followed us out to a carriage which horace had already attached to a couple of horses we flew down the streets of durban as if we were being pulled by exterminator and old rosebud and within twenty minutes or so we pulled up at the racetrack major dobbins was waiting for us at the finish line with the track steward my dear doctor jones he said extending his hand as we approached him i trust you slept well you know i have been giving the matter considerable thought and have concluded that this is really a rather barbaric way of settling our little dispute my own sentiments exactly i said would you consider some other means of so doing he asked such as we could cut a deck of cards he said producing just such a deck now just a minute said emily im not one to encourage bloodshed lord knows but while i can see certain justifications for an affair of honor cutting cards for my hand just doesnt qualify as such besides said the steward we have charged all thousand spectators an extra shilling per head were likely to have a riot if you call the thing off well my friend said the major it would seem that we have no choice he gestured to a track official who walked up with a mahogany box containing two pistols i was offered first choice and since they looked alike to me i just grabbed the one that was closer evidently i did it with such skill and swiftness that the crowd thought i knew what i was doing because a little murmur of approval spread through them the major took the other one and we stood backtoback at the finish line at my signal said the steward you will each take ten paces turn and fire any fouls and or disqualifications will be at the discretion of the tracks governing board are you ready yes said the major i suppose so i said good said the steward proceed the major must have taken quicker steps than me because i heard two shots before i got to my tenth step false start cried the steward now what i asked turning around you do it again until you get it right said the steward so we did it again and this time we turned and faced each other at the same instant i heard a lot of shots coming from the majors direction and i just closed my eyes pointed the gun toward him and kept firing until i was out of bullets halt cried the steward what now demanded the major you wounded nine spectators and killed a mule said the steward disgustedly are you sure you want to continue with this absolutely said the major all right then said the steward as we reloaded our weapons this time get back to back and only go five paces maybe that will help well to make a long story short we each fired off six more bullets and nothing much happened except that we took the head off a guinea hen that had wandered onto the track by mistake the crowd started getting ugly then and one of them threw a rock that grazed the majors skull foul he cried and fell to the dirt track how is he i asked moseying over tis a far far better thing i do than i have ever done said the major oh get up snapped the steward ive seen fly bites draw more blood than that the major got uneasily to his feet and waved a victory sign to the crowd which booed in return may i make a suggestion said the steward shoot i said and the major hit the ground again whats the matter now i asked helping him to his feet you might select your words a little more carefully he said sternly my suggestion said the steward impatiently go ahead i said since you two are not the most skillful marksmen i have ever seen i suggest that we might bring this unhappy affair of honor to a conclusion a mite quicker if you switched to swords a capital suggestion cried the major enthusiastically a moment later a couple of military sabers were brought out they had to show me how to hold mine but the major grabbed his like it was an old friend and started swishing it through the air as if he was slicing mosquitoes in half are you ready asked the steward not by a long shot i said still trying out how to hold it without sticking my thumb over the bell too damned bad said the steward proceed the major gave me a great big grin and a great big salute with his sword and i figured that me and the lord would be hobnobbing in person in just a couple more seconds then he lunged forward at me and i heard something that sounded like a gunshot only louder owww he screamed and i noticed that he was standing still as a statue which was kind of difficult since he was all stretched out one leg dragging behind him and one arm extended toward me what happened i asked him putting my sword down and staring at him with my hands on my hips i must have thrown my back out he grated i cant move well me and the steward called time out and tried to straighten the major up but he sure enough wasnt kidding about being stuck in that position after about ten minutes we gave up and i walked over to emily perrison miss emily i said i just dont think id feel right about killing the major under these conditions him being helpless and all and especially not with so many witnesses i understand she said patting my hand its your christian goodness rising to the fore im glad nobody got killed i said so am i she smiled im not said horace sullenly well then i said if youll just name the happy date miss emily ill announce our nuptials to all and sundry ive been giving the matter some serious thought during these past few minutes lucifer she said slowly and i have decided to give myself in marriage to major dobbins but why i said i mean i could go over and slice him up a little if thats all that stands in the way of our getting hitched its more than that lucifer she said youre so good and pure and true such a christian gentleman that youd never be happy tied down to a family in a dull little city like durban when you could be off converting cannibals and lepers and the like whereas major dobbins on the other hand has a certain weakness of the spirit that makes his salvation a real challenge to me but miss emily i can be just as weak as he can i protested no i wont hear of it she said firmly youre too good for me lucifer its the major who wanted my money while you only wanted to serve our god suppose i wanted your money too i said would that make a difference to you dont be silly she laughed youre too fine and pure to think such sordid thoughts i am i asked unhappily absolutely now you and the major will each get what you want and ill have made both of you happy but onward christian soldier she cried with a wild evangelical gleam in her eye i took one last look at horace and decided that staying single might not be the worst of all possible fates so i took my leave of durban while they were still trying to decide whether to take the major to a doctor or coat him over with paint and use him as a lawn statue i camped north of town that night and had a little heartto heart with my silent partner who pointed out that he had littered south africa with diamonds and other baubles and that as long as i was here anyway this might not be a bad time to look for them it sounded good to me and i headed inland in search of my fortune determined to keep no diamonds under eighteen carats chapter the lost race you know diamonds are a lot harder to find than you might think i must have spent the better part of two weeks looking in caves and gorges and riverbeds and valleys and abandoned rock quarries without finding a single one i even checked out a couple of exoticlooking orchards just in case i was dead wrong about where diamonds came from but i finally had to admit that there was more to the diamondprospecting business than met the eye since i was fresh out of funds actually theres wasnt nothing fresh about it id been out of funds for quite a long time i took a job dealing faro when i hit germiston a quaint little village a few of miles east of johannesburg i gave it up after a couple of days though after i earned enough money to buy a secondhand chautauqua tent i supplemented my meager preaching income by hosting a few friendly games of bingo until i realized that the bingo cards were costing me more than i was winning from the natives since there wasnt much of a market for warthogs teeth and such other trinkets as they used for legal tender and finally i made up my mind to light out for nairobi the next day to see if i couldnt scare up a little more money in british east africa than i was finding in the down under side of the continent i told my helpers to show up at noon for their severance pay but then i got to thinking about the story of job and decided that a little hardship and disappointment was probably just the kind of strengthening and hardening their spirits needed so i turned in early and made up my mind to leave town a bit before daybreak i was snoring away in my hotel room minding my own business and not bothering no one when i was awakened by the sound of a door opening i sat up rubbed my eyes and saw as pretty a little lady as i had ever experienced standing in my doorway she was dressed all in blue silks and veils that didnt hide half as much as she thought they did and she had the strangest headdress topping her yellow hair have you got it she whispered walking into the room and closing the door behind her maam i said with a smile ive got it and to spare to what do i owe the distinct pleasure of this here nocturnal visitation the malaloki armband she said where is it probably in malaloki wherever that may be i answered however youre welcome to search every inch of me which im sure youll agree is a pretty generous offer to make to a total stranger but you must have it she hissed i dont know what youre talking about i answered you are lucifer jones are you not the right reverend lucifer jones at your service i said you sure you dont want to search me for this here armband this is not a matter for levity she said sternly neither is breaking and entering i pointed out though i added the lord does teach us to forgive our brothers trespasses of course he dont say much about our sisters trespasses but im sure you and me can work something out if we just put our heads together i will ask you one more time where is it i dont know i said with a shrug on the other hand i sure am glad that youve asked me for the last time what would you like to talk about now she looked at me frowned and opened the door and before i knew it two big white guys dressed in leopardskin robes had burst into the room and were threatening me with spears they both had on the same kind of headdresses as the girl kind of feathery with a couple of little jewels right at the front hanging down over their foreheads but somehow the headdresses didnt look as good on them or maybe it was just that they kept jabbing me in the short ribs with the points of their weapons i must have that armband mister jones said the girl doctor jones i corrected her sucking in my stomach as far as i could as the spears kept pressing against it make no mistake about it doctor jones she said two men have already died this evening i hope it wasnt nothin catching i said with as much compassion as i could muster which truth to tell wasnt near as much as i might have had under other circumstances they died because of the malaloki armband she said meaningfully what is it some kind of rasslin hold i asked an ancient and sacred ornament of the malaloki which may be worn only by one of our gods well i hate to disappoint a lovable little lady like yourself i said but despite my handsome and cleancut good looks i aint no god the malaloki armband was stolen two moons past by a disloyal subject she continued impassively we traced it to germiston and here we lost it until tonight the man who had stolen it had traded it for food and other worldly goods the storekeeper had sold it to a boer the boer had given it to a black house servant and the servant lost it to you in a game of chance you have it and now you must give it to us or your life shall be forfeit but i aint seen any armbands i said as they began prodding me a little harder with their spear tips not gold nor silver nor brass nor any kind wait she commanded holding her hand imperiously above her head and suddenly the two guys with the weapons backed off a bit possibly you do not as yet know the shape and texture of that about which i speak the malaloki armband has no commercial value but is made of shells joined together in a mystic design of overwhelming power and import well why didnt you say so in the first place i said i took in what i thought was a little ankle bracelet made of strung together shells the armband she exclaimed finally showing some emotion even if not the kind i would have preferred to see from a blonde in a seethrough blue wraparound i think its worthless you think its priceless i said hows about we split the difference and i trade it to you for a couple of them jewels off your headdresses unless they got some special religious significance too doctor jones she said we will trade you your life for the armband that should constitute a considerable profit for you considering the alternative i suppose i could do a mite worse i admitted begrudgingly where is it ive got a whole bag of junk begging your pardon over at my tent waitll i get my clothes on and ill take you there which i did though we must have made a funnylooking sight stalking through the narrow streets of germiston at three in the morning i couldnt see much sense returning to the hotel just to wake the desk clerk so i slipped a deck of cards into my pocket and made up my mind to head right off for nairobi once our business was done when we got to the tent it turned out that none of us had any matches so i just started walking around kind of feeling blindly for the bag after a couple of minutes i stepped on something that made a pretty loud crunching sound and i knew that i had found the trinket the girl ran over and started pulling stuff out of the bag and a couple of seconds later she gave out a shriek that would have woke such dead as werent otherwise occupied at the time what seems to be the problem maam i asked out of an innate sense of courtesy its broken she cried holding up a bunch of busted shells that were hanging together by a few torn threads thats a shame i said sympathetically maybe you could hunt up some clams or oysters or something and stitch up a replacement you do not understand what this means she wept maybe even lobster shells i added thoughtfully theres a pretty good seafood shop over in johannesburg and silence roared one of the two men pointing his spear at me i didnt see much sense in making helpful suggestions if that was the way they had been taught to respond to an act of christian goodwill so i just stood there while the three of them went into a little powwow finally they broke it up and the girl walked over to me you will come with us she announced i really had other plans i said and started telling her about how i aimed to build the tabernacle of saint luke i got about three sentences into my story when one of the men started jabbing me with his spear again you will come with us she repeated you will speak to our gods and tell them how the armband came to be broken and possibly they will spare our lives i took another close look at all their various jewels which sure seemed pretty common and unimportant to them and made up my mind on the spot ill be happy to come along with you i said with a great big smile you may not know it but speaking to gods is one of the very best things i do me being a man of the cloth and all we stepped out of the tent and began walking to the north after we had gotten a couple of miles out of town the girl turned to me again i hope you understand doctor jones she said that any attempt to escape while we make our way to malaloki will be dealt with severely i give you my word as a christian and a gentleman that such a thought aint never crossed my mind i said truthfully naturally assuming that such a verbal contract expired once we got to wherever they kept their jewels well we walked and we walked and then we walked some more i kept assuming that cairo or marrakech would pop into view any second but she assured me that we were still in south africa and that we werent heading no farther than nyasaland which i hadnt never heard of before and which i now began picturing as a great huge field of grass with a bunch of baby nyasas hopping around on it during our trek i learned that her name was melora and that she had learned her english from some missionaries which was kind of surprising because it seemed like everyone i had met in africa had learned their english from missionaries and yet i was the only bonafide missionary that i knew of wandering around in the bush she surprised me still further by saying that her native tongue wasnt french or german or portugese or anything like that but was the malaloki dialect which was the first time i learned that they invented languages as well as armbands we were about ten days into our little journey when we crossed into nyasaland the landscape started changing and pretty soon the bushland turned into a kind of gently rolling forest filled with gently rolling rhinos and leopards and other fearsome beasts that looked like they wanted nothing more than a little snack made of christian missionary and maybe a little bit of blonde malaloki for dessert but our two big spearmen managed to bluff all the animals away which was undoubtedly for the best since i couldnt see how they could reload a spear if their first fling missed and we passed through the forest unscathed except for tick bites and mosquito bites and fly bites and being bothered by some rude maribou storks that kept flying overhead right after theyd had lunch and finally we came to a great big volcanic crater stuck right in the middle of a long plateau i figured that we were going to hike around it but melora walked straight ahead an d started following a narrow little path up the side of it i grabbed hold of her arm and explained that while the top of the crater was undoubtedly a good sight closer to god and heaven she didnt have to do this on my account as i was perfectly content to worship him from afar or at least ground level for a few more years and besides the path disappeared a couple of hundred yards ahead of us for a woman with a short little nose she sure made a production of looking down it at me finally she yanked her arm loose and started climbing again i called ahead to her that i was going to start back down to the base of the volcano and would meet her on the other side but no sooner were the words out of my mouth than the two big guys started jabbing me with their spears again so i didnt have no choice but to follow her i did so for maybe a hundred yards when suddenly she just upped and vanished i mean one second i was following that beautiful round bottom up the path which in truth was all the kept me going and the next second she was gone beautiful bottom and all i stopped scratched my head and looked around but couldnt see hide nor hair of her which was a considerable amount of hide and hair to vanish from the earth all at once then i felt a hand on my arm and i was dragged off the path into a narrow little tunnel where are we i whispered just follow me said melora follow you i repeated i cant even see you grab my hand she said i reached out for it that doctor jones is not my hand i apologized and after a little more groping around i finally got ahold of what i was supposed to get ahold of and pretty soon we were wending our way through this damp winding tunnel after about ten minutes of walking into walls and into melora who may have been softer than the walls but wasnt a whole lot friendlier or more understanding we emerged onto a large ledge overlooking a village on the grassy floor of the dead volcano malaloki i asked she nodded a little river wended its way amongst the thatched huts then went out through a hole it had carved out of one of the walls this crater didnt hold a candle to some of the larger ones i was aware of like for instance the ngorongoro crater in tanganyika but one the other hand the ngorongoro crater wasnt awash in jewels and blonde women so i didnt feel no great disappointment with my current surroundings melora waited until the two big guys had joined us then led the way down another winding trail to the base of the wall a bunch of white women wearing even less than melora raced up and jabbered at her in some foreign tongue she talked right back at them just as quick and incomprehensible and took me by the hand and led me through the village until we came to the biggest hut which was located smackdab in the center then she bowed and backed away in front of the hut were two grass hammocks and in each hammock was a grubbylooking white man with a bushy beard one of them must have been close to seven feet tall and the other couldnt have been more than an inch or two over five feet both of them were wearing khaki pants that had been cut off above the knees and they each had a batch of necklaces made out of emeralds and sapphires and rubies and other colorful baubles well look what we got here brother said the big one sure as hell dont look like no malaloki i ever seen said the little one whats your name stranger asked the big one the honorable right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service i said stooping over in a courtly bow begging your pardon but you gents sure dont sound like malalokis from what little ive heard you speak neither do you said the little one no reason why i should i said im an american so are we said the big one of course added the little one were also gods but around these here parts the two aint necessarily incompatible in fact continued the big one along with being gods and americans were also brothers im frothingham schmidt and hes oglethorpe schmidt but them who would consider themselves our friends or at least express an interest in ever seeing another sunrise call us long schmidt and short schmidt im short schmidt said the little one well im mighty glad to find a couple of countrymen here i said you wouldnt happen to have a little something for a thirsty traveler with maybe just enough alcohol to whip the tar out of the germs first things first said long schmidt we aint set foot outside our little kingdom in six years and we got some important questions to ask about the rest of the world and well you should i said youll be pleased and happy to know that we won the war to end all wars who gives a damn about that said short schmidt were pittsburgh boys pittsburgh born and bred where did the pirates finish last year third or fourth as i recollect i answered damn that john mcgraw said long schmidt tell me doctor jones who won the kentucky derby of seems to me that it was omar khayyam i said yahoo cried short schmidt tossing a necklace into the air if we ever get back to caseys bar old flathead mahoney is gonna owe me a double sawbuck we didnt mean to forget our manners doctor jones said long schmidt its just that certain things are very important to us now well join you in that drink he clapped his hands twice and a couple of ripe young maidens brought us a round of fruit drinks with just a little something extra added so doctor jones said short schmidt when we had all had a couple of long swallows what brings you to the kingdom of the malaloki friendship curiosity an adventurous spirit and mostly a woman named melora i said ah yes melora said short schmidt lovely girl our wife added long schmidt one of em anyway said short schmidt truth to tell jones the blasted village is damned near overflowing with goddessesbymarriage easy now brother said long schmidt doctor jones is a man of the cloth perhaps he disapproves no such a thing i assured them solomon had a pile of wives and the good book never said a word against him doctor jones said short schmidt with a smile you got the makings of a right friendly neighbor thank you kindly i said you fellers mind if i ask you a couple of questions go right ahead said short schmidt who are the malaloki and howd you ever get to be gods here well thats kind of a long story doctor jones said long schmidt me and short came over to africa seven years ago to scare us up some diamonds didnt seem that hard when we planned it but ill be damned if we could find a single one diamond mines is well hid in these parts i agreed mines exclaimed short schmidt son of a bitch we thunk they grew inside oysters thats pearls i said did you find any of them at least never even found an oyster said short schmidt came near to getting et by crocodiles a couple of times oh i said well if you ever go oyster hunting again i think youll have a little more luck in the ocean than in the rivers we aint likely to ever see a ocean again said long schmidt mournfully let me get back to the main thrust of our tragic story doctor jones so youll know why were so happy to see you be my guest i said taking another drink that one of the local maidens offered me like short told you we came here to seek fame and fortune mostly the latter matter of fact we had a little more fame with the local constabularies than we could handle which is how we came to take our leave of the civilized portions of africa and head inland we set up shop as traders added short schmidt wed make a round of the zulus swapping brass cartridges for goats then wed trade the goats for salt trade the salt for cattle and sell the cattle at market it was a tidy little business so what happened i asked well we had a little difference of opinion with a tribe called the shona about whether having a couple of friendly drinks and smokes together constitutes a bonafide proposition of marriage and we had to take our leave of them a little more quickly than we would have liked perfectly understandable i said my thoughts precisely said long schmidt i just wish the shona could have seen it that way anyway we took off in the middle of the night and since our bushcraft aint exactly up to snuff especially by shona standards we kept on running for two days and two nights just to make sure that we werent being followed too closely and on the third morning continued short schmidt we ran up against this here crater we were both feeling kind of tired and out of sorts what with having been running for our lives all that time so we thought wed climb up the wall of the crater a way and take a little rest once we were out of sight well we stumbled onto some tunnel or other and an hour later here we were surrounded by the lost tribe of the malaloki of course they aint so lost as they was added long schmidt with both of us and now you stumbling across them but theyre lost enough i dont think well ever get out of here make up your mind i said are you gods or are you prisoners well truth to tell said short schmidt there seems to be a fine and highly technical legal line between the two seems that their legends told of a couple of gods who would come here disguised as white men well you got no problem that i can see i said hah snorted long schmidt the problem said short schmidt is that two other white guys wandered in here about fifty years ago and after theyd got all the ladies pregnant and picked up the choicer gemstones they just up and left so the malaloki have decided that as long as we stay here we must be gods and we can do damned near anything we want continued long schmidt but the second we leave weve proved that were just men after all and theyve got about twenty beefy young men on the other side of that crater wall waiting to make pincushions out of us i can see where that might get to be a nuisance i agreed thats why we sent melora after you said short schmidt by the way i said im supposed to tell you that melora didnt break the sacred armband i kind of stomped on it accidentally taint noways sacred anyhow said short schmidt we knew that one of the young bucks was going to germiston for some seeds to plant so we snuck it into his pouch and told melora that hed went and swiped a sacred object how come i asked melora aint exactly the most humorous critter weve ever run into said long schmidt we figured shed move heaven and earth to get that armband back and we were kind of hoping that shed wipe out enough locals so that someone would follow her back here like maybe an army or something big like that so while were delighted to see a fellow countryman and especially one who knows how the pirates are doing these days said short schmidt id have to say that on the whole you represent a considerable disappointment to us meaning no offense none taken i said who are the malaloki anyway as near as we can figure it said long schmidt theyre the descendants of some roman outpost probably been living in the crater some fifteen hundred years or so a few of em leave every now and then to buy things we can get down here and to learn a little english but they always come back for a while there we and short really talked up the outside world in the hope that one by one theyd all go out and make their way and leave us alone here with the jewels but so far it aint happened so here we are concluded short schmidt gods of the malaloki with the power of life and death over our subjects and every whim catered to so long as we dont walk more than six hundred yards from where we are now we may never see the pirates again power of life and death you say i asked were gods aint we why not kill em off and just walk out free as birds i suggested weve thunk it over long and hard admitted short schmidt but while we dont back off none at a little serious swindling and cardsharking murdering a whole lost tribe would probably put us off our feed of course we may eventually get around to killing off all the menfolk added long schmidt i dont like the way they look at us whenever we get married which is pretty damned often now that i come to think of it well now brothers i said you sound right happy and fulfilled as things stand what in the world would you do if you ever got out of here run like hell said short schmidt devoutly i mean after that i said see if we couldnt land us a grubstake and marry us a couple of good women and settle down making sure to buy lifetime season tickets to the pirates is old honus wagner still playing for them he quit five or six years back as i recollect i said damn said short schmidt no wonder they aint won any pennants to speak of damn that john mcgraw and his giants added long schmidt passionately i could see they were bound and determined to talk about baseball for a few hours so i decided that it was a good time to take my leave of them well i said this has been a fascinating experience hobnobbing with a couple of fleshand blood gods and seeing a lost civilization and all but i think maybe the time has come for me to depart what makes you think youre going anywhere demanded long schmidt what reason have you got to keep me i said i told you everything i know about baseball and nobodys got around to declaring me a god yet first you got to help us get out of here said short schmidt after all fair is fair i dont see nothing fair about it i said getting a little hot under the collar dont look so glum jones said long schmidt if you actually do figure a way to get us out of here well let you scoop up a handful of gems on the way out which of course put a whole new light on things i let one of their wives lead me to a little hut and i lay down in a hammock and divided my attention between her and the problem at hand spending most of the night tackling first one and then the other and by morning i had the solution i hunted up melora who was about as giggly as ever which is to say not at all and told her that i had hit upon a way to turn her gods and husbands into a pair of contented stayathomes truly she said her eyes widening trust me i said confidently it is almost too much to ask it all depends on you melora i told her what must i do she asked i want you to pick up a couple of rubies or emeralds from wherever it is you guys are hiding them and then go on a little shopping trip to germiston for me i had to explain what i wanted two or three times before she finally understood and i told her to make sure to take a couple of husky lads along to haul my purchase back then after she left sometime around noon i brought out the good book and decided to see if i couldnt bring a little of the true religion to these white heathen and get them to cast their false gods out into the cold just in case my other idea didnt work well i was at it for the better part of three weeks and no one got converted but we all had a fine old time singing hymns and trying to live up to the doings and deeds of all them holy men especially in regard to all the begatting they did the malaloki were fair to middling cooks and were the first of roman descent id run across who didnt smother everything in tomatoes and mozzarella cheese the schmidt brother had shown them how to make a kind of wine from fermented fruits that didnt taste too good but packed one hell of a punch and between the eating and the drinking and the begatting i sure couldnt see why they were so allfired eager to leave twenty days after melora left she returned with her two companions lugging a batch of packages i had them put the stuff into my hut before the brothers saw them and went to work when i was done assembling everything i made sure it all worked and then called long schmidt and short schmidt over what have you got to show us jones said long schmidt ducking his head down to get in through my doorway looks kind of like a radio said short schmidt shortwave i said should that mean something asked long schmidt i held the earphones between them and started cranking the dynamo the pirates lead two to nothing in the seventh and john mcgraw is calling heinie groh back and is sending frankie frisch up to pinchhit with runners on first and i pulled a tube out of the set and smashed it on the floor of the hut my god wailed short schmidt what have you done nothing much i said pleasantly i got a spare hidden away where screamed long schmidt in agonized tones why if i told you it wouldnt be hidden much longer would it i asked fix it screamed short schmidt its my radio i said i put it together and i attached it to the dynamo and i even laid six hundred feet of antenna up the side of the crater ill fix it when i feel like listening to it again right now though im planning on taking a nap well kill you bellowed long schmidt tears streaming down his bearded face that aint going to get you your tube i said what do you want for it said short schmidt getting down on his knees and sobbing a little oh nothing much i answered maybe just my freedom and a handful of gemstones to tide me over during hard times that was to be your reward for getting us out of here said long schmidt accusingly why not think over your position for a minute i said you got more wives than you can shake a stick at you got a couple of cushy lifetime jobs with no heavy lifting and you got the pittsburgh pirates just a couple of huts away you got more precious stones than anyone ever thought existed and nice weather and three squares a day are you sure you really want to leave they put their heads together and muttered under their breaths for a while then short schmidt walked over to his own hut and returned a minute later with a big metal box one handful he said opening it up no more i reached in and pulled out a fistful of rubies and sapphires and other such trinkets and stuffed them into my pockets then i took them out behind my hut to a little spot id marked dug down about five or six inches with my fingers and handed them the tube anything i can do for you two when i reach civilization i asked preparing to take my leave of them while they were fiddling with the shortwave any messages you want me to deliver just send a note to our folks back in pittsburgh telling them were okay said short schmidt and maybe find a way to tell the pirates they need more lefthanded pitching just then the giants score three runs in the top of the eighth and i could see that there wasnt much sense in trying to talk to them any longer as they were spending all their energy calling down their godly wrath on john mcgraw so i took my leave of them melora shot me the first smile i had ever seen from her and walked me to the tunnel and guided me through and didnt even holler when i didnt exactly grab her hand again we finally made it to the plateau that the crater sat on i kissed her goodbye real courtlylike and with a handsome fortune in my pockets i set off for civilization with the happy knowledge that me and god would finally be colandlords of the tabernacle of saint luke chapter the lord of the jungle me and the lord spent the next couple of weeks walking in a northerly direction and discussing just how much of our modest fortune should go into the actual building of our tabernacle and how much should be held back for the two of us to live on i also learned that having a pocketful of gemstones is a hell of a lot different from wanting one now that i was a wealthy man i was so worried about highwaymen and other rogues robbing a law abiding citizen like myself that i carefully avoided all cities and military outposts and even made a huge detour that took me a good forty miles out of my way rather than chance running into a safari that i heard up ahead in point of fact it was all this maneuvering that got me lost i started hitting one forest after another which i knew meant i was having some slight difficulty since british east aint got no forests and pretty soon there werent any gaps at all between them and then it started doing a little serious nonstop raining and i soon got to the point where i would gladly have traded the lords share of the stones for a raincoat and a map also as i walked along i kept getting the feeling that i was being watched by unseen eyes which in my broad experience on the dark continent are the very worst kind of eyes to be watched by finally one day i started seeing huge manlike shapes way off in the distance so i figured i was in gorilla country and spent most of my waking hours trying to recollect whether or not gorillas ate people i even did a little serious lumbering and grunting in the hope that they might think i was one of them but then i got to figuring that i looked pretty feminine as gorillas went and i didnt want to have to fight off no impassioned bull gorillas or even bull chimpanzees if push came to shove so i went back to walking like the goodlooking godfearing white man that i am i spent another couple of days in the muck and mire of the forest floor and was just about sure i was lost beyond salvation when an arrow thudded home about three inches from my head as i leaned up against a huge old tree i looked up just in time to see a tall bronzed white man wearing nothing but a dagger and loincloth step out from behind some bushes with a bow and a couple of arrows clutched in his right hand what are you doing in my jungle he demanded in deep stern tones looking for a way out i told him sincerely and who are you he asked glaring at me the right reverend honorable doctor lucifer jones at your service i said flashing him a big sundaymorning smile preaching and salvation done cheap with a group rate for funerals good he said sighing deeply and looking mightily relieved i was afraid you might be from barrow phillips and smythe who are they my british creditors you expect them to follow you here i asked youve no idea how firm their resolve can be he said allow me to introduce myself i am john caldwell lord bloomstoke make up your mind i said i beg your pardon which are you caldwell or bloomstoke both one is a title unfortunately it costs a lot more to support a title these days than it ever used to and finally i had to flee the country to avoid my creditors and their solicitors but why here i asked i aint seen naught but grubworms and an occasional monkey in days i thought i was purchasing an uptodate plantation he admitted you can imagine my distress when i found out that what i really owned was six square miles of the ituri rain forest whod you buy it from i asked just out of politeness a realtor with absolutely impeccable credentials replied bloomstoke what was his name now ah yes von horst figgers i said you know of him in a manner of speaking i answered how long have you been out here four years as near as i can tell thats a long time to be stuck in the bush i remarked what do you do to keep from going nuts oh i spend a lot of the time talking to my friends he said friends i repeated you got friends stashed away around here watch he said with a smile then he put his fingers to his lips and let out a weird whistle and a couple of minutes later a pair of gorillas broke into a clearing about thirty yards away bloomstoke immediately started jabbering at them in some gutteral language i hadnt never heard before and they nodded their heads and disappeared back into the forest are you telling me they understand you i asked absolutely he said i studied french at oxford theres very little difference except that apes have only the haziest understanding of the future imperfect except as it relates to hunting for grubworms youre pulling my leg right not a bit he smiled if you have any messages for them ill be happy to translate for you of course you have to be a little careful with your idioms for example if i were to tell them that you thought we were pulling your leg and i didnt remember to drop half a tone on the double arrrgeth sound they would immediately come over and pull your leg off he paused but aside from such minor technicalities we have quite excellent conversations of course its not as if they can discuss platos republic with any depth of understanding but on the other hand they also cant discuss sartre and decartes at all which i for one consider a definite plus and you live with these here gorillas i asked oh yes he said happily in fact ive worked my way up into their hierarchy due to my physical prowess you see apes fight for their various leaderships positions at this very moment he added with more than a touch of pride i am assistant to the second vice president now i would have sworn they had a king i said shaking my head in wonderment oh they used to before we started discussing the problems inherent in constitutional monarchies replied bloomstoke we currently have a very limited republic but i wont quit until weve established a true socialist state well brother bloomstoke i said it sure sounds like youve accomplished quite a lot in just four years time thank you he said modestly but theres so much to do my god do you realize that we havent even taken the first small steps toward establishing a group medical plan i would imagine that most of your medical emergencies consist of being et by lions and leopards and the like and as such would be somewhat beyond the scope of a group plan i opined true he admitted but you cant just have a bureaucracy and not give it anything to do thats just plain wasteful no doctor jones i appreciate your kind words truly i do but there is so much left undone seems to me youve done more than enough i said soothingly he shook his head sadly even our military establishment cant seem to function efficiently you got a military establishment i asked surprised of course he said our economy was in a shambles we couldnt see any way of bringing it back to life except by gearing up for a little war who are you going to fight with elephants thats not an issue at this point he said when were geared up and ready well find an enemy have you considered the possibility that maybe you bit off a little more than you can chew i suggested sometimes it feels that way he admitted with a deep sigh i mean i speak to them of romeo and juliet or arthur and guinevere and all they want to do is enter into uncomplicated relationships with other apes thats all right i can accept that i really can but when i try to discuss welfare statism and all they want to do is peel bananas his voice trailed off and his handsome face contorted as he fought to hold back a manly little sob look at the bright side i said you got your health you aint sitting in a debtors prison and youve actually learned their language i know he said but sometimes i get so frustrated do you know what the gorilla word for moon is kablooga you try to write a poem and see what the hell rhymes with kablooga in a way its an ever sillier language than french of course there aint no law that says you got to associate with them i pointed out with all their faults theyre still preferable to men he replied hotly they dont cheat at cards or vote for laissez faire capitalism or mix their drinks im just pointing out alternatives i said i know he said im inclined to be emotional these days i suspect it all goes back to my troubles with barrow phillips and smythe i was about to make some comforting remark or other when a huge bull gorilla broke cover about two hundred yards away stared balefully at us for a couple of minutes and walked off into the bushes that was george said bloomstoke hes probably trying to let me know tactfully that its time for a meeting of the governing council another gorilla came out of the bushes no more than ten feet away and walked up to me its just george explained bloomstoke calmly hes come to see who you are but he was a furlong away just a couple of seconds ago no that was a different one said bloomstoke you call them both george i asked i call them all george he replied it helps impart the notion that the state is more important than the individual the george that was examining me put his face about two inches from mine and glared into my eyes with his own little bloodshot ones his teeth were sort of rotten and his breath wasnt much better but as much as i wanted to turn my head away i thought it best not to make any real sudden moves at last george turned to bloomstoke and jabbered something bloomstoke jabbered back and then turned to me george wants to know if youre a whig or a tory he said i got to admit it aint a subject over which ive pondered many long and burdensome hours i answered they jabbered back and forth again and finally george gave me a little snarl and went back off into the jungle i told him you were an anarchist said bloomstoke it was easier than explaining why you choose not to exercise your franchise actually i used to exercise the tar out of it when i was back in the states i said id vote early and often for whichever candidate was quick on the draw with a tenspot or a little pure kentucky bourban an interesting notion remarked bloomstoke and one i may have to introduce very shortly you see weve got a sheriff and a marshall and a police force but the concept of lawbreaking is totally unknown to them which makes for more waste than usual among our officeholders well it was all too complicated for me and i just walked along in silence while bloomstoke outlined his grandiose plans to me he must have been running off at the mouth for the better part of an hour when we heard a gunshot off in the distance more territorial aggrandizement he muttered his eyes gleaming ill have to put a stop to this he turned to me how are you at racing through the treeways you mean swinging on vines like unto a monkey i asked he nodded brother bloomstoke i got troubles enough just keeping on the trail as it meanders along through the bush and thats with the comforting knowledge that if i slip and fall ill hit the ground in less than twenty or thirty seconds and probably wont bounce maybe youd best race off ahead of me id like to but i cant leave you alone with the apes he replied theyve never seen an anarchist before and theres no telling what they might do and with that he cupped his hands over his mouth and gave a scream that would have woke such dead as werent otherwise occupied at the time i couldnt figure out what was going on until about two minutes later when a huge elephant thundered up out of the bush crushing trees right and left and skidding to a halt directly in front of bloomstoke goola my friend he said stepping forward and petting the elephant on the trunk while i decided that the whole proceedings made a lot more sense when watched from behind a large tree come on out doctor jones he called goola will provide us with transportation how do i know that i wont provide old goola here with a little snack i asked for to my eyes goola was looking decidedly elevenoclockish an opinion that was strengthened by the loud rumbling noises that his belly was making goola will do what i tell him to do said bloomstoke firmly now come out so that he can see you i dont know about this i said from behind my tree he cant eat what he cant see elephants are herbivores said bloomstoke theyre also very nearsighted i pointed out maybe i look like a fig tree to him if you dont come out instantly ill simply leave you behind he said i quickly discussed my options with my silent partner and we decided that being left behind was very minimally the less desirable of two admittedly depressing alternatives so i slowly left the protection of my tree and edged a step at a time over toward goola let him smell the back of your hand said bloomstoke i held out my hand and goola took a good whiff almost pulling my arm out of the socket in the process good said bloomstoke vigorously now were all friends goola lift us up goola pawed the ground three times with his right front foot no goola said bloomstoke lift goola rolled over on his back and closed his eyes idiot snapped bloomstoke i kept feeling we should throw him a fish or something but my companion stalked off furiously come on jones well walk when we got about a hundred yards away goola trumpeted six or seven times and stood on his head then we took a hard left around a waitabit thorn tree and i couldnt see him anymore though we could hear him for another ten minutes we followed an old rhino trail in the direction of the gunshots and in about half an hour bloomstoke held out his arm practically decapitating me as i walked by him and when i fell to the ground gurgling and gasping for air he put a forefinger to his lips silence he whispered well i would have told him what i thought of his silence but i was a little preoccupied with choking to death so i merely glared at him and quietly urged the lord to strike him either dead or mute whichever came first i got my breath back and stood up just in time to see bloomstoke stride out of the bushes into a clearing to confront a kind of smallish white man dressed all in khaki who are you that invades my jungle bloomstoke demanded im capturing clyde calhoun said the white man not looking the least bit scared or startled and you are either the strongest white man or the puniest gorilla ive ever laid eyes on what is your business here said bloomstoke ominously business laughed calhoun aint you never read my books or seen my movies im capturing clyde i go out after the most dangerous animals in the world except for redheads named thelma and bring em back alive and put em in my circus or turn em over to zoos or gourmet chefs or other interested parties what animals do you seek gorillas said calhoun thought id bring back fifteen or twenty of em before theyre all extinct i distinctly heard the reports of a powerful gun said bloomstoke you bet your boots you did said calhoun holding up a lee enfield military rifle or at least you would if you were wearing any boots i thought you told me that you brought them back alive said bloomstoke accusingly maybe i should reword that a bit said calhoun them what i bring back is alive i just take old betsy here and aim right betwixt their eyes and fire away anything still breathing gets captured and civilized wheres your camp asked bloomstoke about eight miles behind me said calhoun you cant miss it ive got two hundred porters a dozen trackers ten cooks a couple of translators and fortythree veterinarians i stepped out of the clearing next to bloomstoke what the hell are you demanded calhoun the right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service i said you got any good funeral ceremonies for hippos he asked i aint never tried my hand at one i admitted then youll have to be at someone elses service reverend jones he said i got a little too enthused down by the river this morning you planning on going back to nairobi anytime in the near future i asked him soon as i pick up my gorillas he said mind if i tag along with you why not he said what the hell are you doing out here in the congo anyway ive mostly been concentrating on being lost i said how about you he said to bloomstoke you coming back to nairobi too this is my jungle said bloomstoke folding his arms across his massive chest i will not leave it and you will not hunt in it do you know who youre talking to roared calhoun im capturing clyde by god and ill hunt where i want this jungle belongs to me and i will not allow you to molest my gorillas reported bloomstoke what kind of pervert do you take me for said calhoun i dont want to molest them i want to capture them no said bloomstoke now i want you to leave my jungle who says its your jungle anyway demanded calhoun bloomstoke reached inside his loincloth and whipped out a pair of folded documents which he handed to calhoun son of a bitch exclaimed calhoun after he had read them i didnt know they could sell a jungle neither did i said bloomstoke morosely whod you buy it from asked calhoun a man named van horst figgers why does everyone say that asked bloomstoke id tell you but it brings back too many unpleasant memories said calhoun i dont suppose youd consider renting me a little section of your jungle with maybe an option to buy i could use the money admitted bloomstoke but id have to present your proposal to the tribe and get their approval and theyre very leery of anything that reeks of capitalism tribe asked calhoun what tribe i didnt know there were any natives in this region this tribe is a little more native than most i said no concluded bloomstoke shaking his head sadly ill never get the ruling council to buy it would it help if i told them they could retain the mineral rights asked calhoun i doubt it said bloomstoke truthfully all right said calhoun ive got another proposition im being paid four thousand pounds for every gorilla i capture if youll let me hunt in your jungle and give me a helping hand ill split the take fiftyfifty with you how many gorillas do you need asked bloomstoke about twenty and i owe barrow phillips and smythe thirtyeight thousand pounds he mused then he shook his head again no i just cant john d rockefeller or j p morgan might have understood but karl marx would come back and haunt me and george would eat you i added what the hell are you guys talking about asked calhoun let me speak to them about accepting a shortterm lease on the jungle said bloomstoke grabbing an overhanging branch and pulling himself up on it maybe i can show them that fabian socialism doesnt necessarily preclude the validity of certain capitalistic principles he leaped into the air caught a low hanging vine and was soon racing through the treetops to meet with the tribe tell me something reverend jones said calhoun leaning against a tree and lighting up a pipe if i can i said amicably when americans go crazy they beat up their wives and spend their life savings on booze which at least keeps their women on their toes and puts a little money back into the economy and when irishmen go crackers they go off and join the ira and help keep down the population of a very crowded little island he paused thoughtfully so how come whenever englishmen go nuts they run around naked in tropical climates i allowed as to how i didnt know but it did seem to be the case at least in my experience he pulled out a small metal flask and offered me a swig and we got to talking about one thing and another passing the time of day very pleasantly when suddenly we heard a horrible sound away off in the distance what is it asked calhoun i cant rightly tell i answered sounds like a bunch of savage voices screaming in fury he said putting his flask away a moment later we heard a noise overhead and saw bloomstoke dropping down from one branch to another until he finally landed right next to us on the ground hurry he cried weve no time to waste what are you talking about brother bloomstoke i asked weve got to get out of here but what happened i persisted they decided that i was a closet imperialist and threw me out of the party me who brought them a fourteenyear agricultural recovery plan whats he talking about reverend asked calhoun i think hes saying that his visas been revoked and he is in some danger of being deported i said falling into step behind bloomstoke as he lit out for the east or worse yet detained without right of counsel are you sure we have to run panted calhoun joining me im sure i have to run i replied you do whatever you think is best we made it to calhouns camp in about three hours the gorillas lined up in a huge semicircle just out of rifle range and kept screaming things at us which bloomstoke translated as capitalist swine and warmongering imperialists and running dogs every now and then one of them would call us ugly naked apes who didnt have the brains to turn over a rotten log and find a handful of succulent grubworms at which bloomstoke would smile and inform us that obviously the entire tribe was not yet radicalized by dawn the next morning it was apparent that the gorillas werent going to come no closer and that bloomstoke wasnt going to let no one go hunting in his jungle so calhoun announced that we would be leaving for nairobi in an hour or so bloomstoke gave out that peculiar scream of his and a few minutes later old goola came lumbering out of the jungle dont shoot him ordered bloomstoke as calhoun raised his rifle but hell trample us said calhoun am i not master of the jungle said bloomstoke with a confident smile he raised his hand and goola came to a sudden stop hoes does whatever you tell him to asked calhoun suddenly interested bloomstoke nodded you ever give any serious thought to appearing in the circus continued calhoun id need thirtyeight thousand pounds said bloomstoke out of the question said calhoun that would include the elephant lets see what he can do said calhoun scratching his head bloomstoke walked up to the pachyderm goola sit he commanded goola picked bloomstoke up with his trunk and deposited the jungle lord on the back of his neck well work on that said bloomstoke hastily put me down goola goola pawed the ground three times with his right front foot while calhoun snorted in derision and walked away i could be an aerielist bloomstoke called after him im really good at swinging from tree to tree ill think about it said calhoun or a sharpshooter continued bloomstoke im a crack shot with a bow and arrow damn you goola put me the hell down well they spent most of the day dickering but the upshot of it all was that calhoun already had a flock of aerielists and besides it would cost too much to lug a bunch of trees and vines around the countryside and erect them under the big top also people didnt pay top dollar to watch bowsandarrow marksmen unless they were with a wild west show which was one of the kinds of shows that calhoun didnt run tell you what ill do said calhoun at last you teach that elephant five tricks by the time we hit nairobi and ill pay you thirtyeight thousand pounds to go on tour with my circus for two years and if i dont asked bloomstoke then ill buy him outright for ten thousand and you can hire on as an animal attendant for standard wages capitalist pig muttered bloomstoke but he shook on it well i never saw an elephant not learn so many tricks in my life as i did during the month it took us to get from the congo to kenya bloomstoke would tell him to stand up and hed roll over bloomstoke would tell him to lie down and hed speak bloomstoke would tell him to speak and hed count with his foot when we were two days out of nairobi it was pretty obvious that bloomstoke was going to come out on the short end of the deal so i walked over to him after everyone else was asleep you been going about this all wrong brother bloomstoke i said taking him off to where we wouldnt disturb nobody what do you mean doctor jones he asked look we all agree that old goola if he aint outandout retarded has at least got a serious learning disability right i said bloomstoke nodded but hes also a goodhearted critter whos eager to please even if he dont know what the hell youre talking about what are you getting at asked bloomstoke why not give him commands in french or ape or some other foreign tongue i suggested then no matter what he does next praise him and act like it was just what you had in mind thats immoral he said sternly well personally i find it a lot less immoral than poverty i said but if you disagree why thats your right just forget i ever suggested it the next morning bloomstoke called calhoun over and gave goola a dozen terse commands in apeish and shortly thereafter signed a thirtyeightthousandpound contract as for me i left bloomstoke and calhoun and their animals behind me and still loaded down with gemstones went off to build my tabernacle in the fair city of nairobi chapter the best little tabernacle in nairobi if you walk through presentday nairobi and ask around you can probably still find three or four oldtimers who remember the tabernacle of saint luke and will be happy to talk to you about it so i think in all fairness that you ought to hear my side of the story too i entered town a couple of hours after id left bloomstoke and calhoun and walked right into the first real estate office i could find not that there were a whole mess of them cluttering up the place in fact except for the new stanley and norfolk hotels there wasnt an awful lot of anything cluttering up the place anyway i told the gent in charge that i wanted to purchase a little stretch of land somewhere near the center of town with the purpose of building my tabernacle there and he explained to me that while he could certainly sell me the land there was a lumber shortage and construction costs had shot up through the roof or they would have if anyone could have afforded a roof for them to shoot up through i got an awful lot of money i told him of course on the other hand the lord teaches us to be thrifty it poses quite a little problem there is an alternative doctor jones he said such as why not purchase an existing structure he suggested it would certainly be less expensive than erecting a comparable building and youd have the added advantage of being able to take possession and move in immediately well now thats right good thinking brother i said and i opine as to how ill do just that why dont you hunt me up the biggest building thats for sale well doctor jones sir he said im thoroughly acquainted with all the property currently listed with our agency and i dont think the largest building is exactly the one youre looking for is the structure sound i asked yes no termites or dry rot no but then i want it i told him decisively have the papers ready to sign and ill be back as soon as i convert these here jewels and gems into coin of the realm and as the lord is my witness that was absolutely all that got said by anybody to anybody i mean how the hell was i to know that the biggest building for sale in nairobi happened to be the cock and bull tavern and lounge or that the cock and bull tavern and lounge wasnt exactly what it appeared to be in fact the first inkling i had was when i moseyed over to it after signing the papers and damned near got trampled in a mad rush of british civil servants who were stopping off for a little refreshment on their way home from a hard day of running the country a couple of ladies in highnecked dresses were standing just outside the doorway passing out pamphlets and singing hymns good day to you sisters i said walking up to them it wont be a good day until this sinful palace of depravity is closed forever said one of them wont you take some of our literature sir no thank you sister i said i never read anything except the good book but perhaps you might tell me why youve singled out this lovely building from amongst all the other buildings in nairobi its not the building sir said the other its what goes on inside it sin and more sin she raised her voice a little in her excitement and as a result two men who were walking on the other side of the street heard her and made a beeline for the cock and bull sinners cried the first woman after them vile depraved men listen sisters i said since im a man of the cloth maybe id best go inside and see if i can put the fear of god into some of these sinners but i want you to keep standing here by the door and telling everyone who comes by what a terrible den of iniquity this is oh we will reverend they cried in unison especially the men i said they nodded their eyes aglow with a sense of purpose and i walked through the doorway the bar looked like any other bar in town with lion and leopard and kudu and buffalo heads hanging from the walls and a bunch of maasai pots serving as spittoons and being the uncannily sharp observer that i am i didnt have to see more than six or seven ladies walking around in their unmentionables before i figured out that either the fans were broken or the cock and bull sold a little more than just liquid refreshments i wandered around the main floor a little enjoying the smells of perfume and incense that wafted on the air and admiring the velvet wallpaper that came with the building then i bumped into still another young lady who was dressed for extremely warm weather good evening sister i said youre wearing your sunday gotomeeting clothes a little early in the week arent you she asked dont let my clothes upset you none i said pleasantly if mine dont upset you yours sure wont upset me she said what can i do for you padre a little something in the missionary position you might tell me how to find whoevers in charge here i said you must mean mademoiselle markoff she said gesturing toward a room at the top of a nearby staircase i thanked her walked up and knocked on the door there was no answer so i opened it and found myself facing a blonde woman with a figure that knute rockne would have traded all four of notre dames horsemen for her arms thighs shoulders and neck all bore a right startling resemblance to those of lord bloomstokes friends and companions she was dressed or rather wrapped in a blue satin harem outfit which looked kind of silly and would have looked even sillier if she hadnt appeared so menacing she was lying on her side on a fur rug sipping a tall drink through a straw and holding a huge cigar in her free hand a couple of young women also done up in satin and wearing huge feathers in their hair were standing behind her and waving ostrichfeather fans over her sweating body what is it she said in a very deep voice allow me to introduce myself i said im the right reverend doctor lucifer jones hows the concierge business these days another reformer she said wearily looking up from her drink begging your pardon madam markoff i said but what i mostly am is a landlord call me mademoiselle markoff im too young and pretty to be a madam or dont you agree she said ominously i agree absolutely mademoiselle i said taking a step backward good she said simpering in a below middle c now whats all this about being a landlord i pulled out the papers and showed them to her oh shit she said tossing them back to me when will you want us to clear out of here mademoiselle markoff you cut me to the quick i said sincerely tossing all them sweet innocent young ladies out into the cold would hardly constitute an act of christian charity especially considering how many customers we got lined up downstairs her eyebrows shot up for just a second and then she gave me a great big grin that started at one ear and ended just short of the other doctor jones she said it looks like youve bought yourself a whorehouse i dont think so mademoiselle i said it just wouldnt appear right me being a man of the cloth and all i dont think i follow you she said taking a deep drag on her cigar blowing the smoke out through her nostrils and sipping twothirds of the drink up through her straw what im saying is that i just dont think a man in my position should own a whorehouse of course as i see it renting a whorehouse to someone else is a whole different kettle of fish ah she said her grin getting even bigger exposing a flock of gold molars along the sides and what will you be wanting well i sure wouldnt want to appear greedy or nothing i said but first of all i need a room downstairs for my tabernacle and what else she persisted half i said damn she snapped youre no better than the last one listen to me doctor jones these are cultured young women here performing a necessary if demeaning social service and just what would it take to make them feel less demeaned i asked sixty percent ought to do it said mademoiselle markoff fiftyfive i said done she said we shook on it how much do you get by the way i asked while trying to urge a little blood back into my hand half of their take she said without hatting an eye well the good lord teaches us to practice moderation in all things so i guess that includes generosity for these poor socially downtrodden young ladies i said youre cute said mademoiselle markoff allowing a lock of blonde hair to fall provocatively over one beady little red eye why thank you kindly i said backing off another step come sit down next to me and have a drink doctor jones she said patting the rug beside her i have a feeling that you and i are going to get along just fine i was about to reply when two gunshots echoed through the building they were followed by a bunch of screams and the sound of footsteps running up and down the corridors and stairs and finally a tall bearded man in a police uniform burst into the room mademoiselle markoff he bellowed he did it again its got to stop beggin your pardon brother i said but what seems to be the problem who the hell are you he demanded the right reverend doctor lucifer jones i said l happen to be the new landlord he looked at mademoiselle markoff who nodded pleased to meet you doctor jones he said extending his hand i am lieutenant nigel todd of the nairobi police are you aware of the exact nature of the establishment you have just purchased everyone who works here is just doing what they can to uplift the spirit of man each in his or her own special way i said taking his hand not quite everyone said todd grimly what happened i asked surely them two ladies out front didnt come in and shoot the place up ill have to explain to them that the good book dwells upon numerous painted women with loving care and in considerable detail its your bouncer said todd whats the matter with him i asked he keeps shooting the customers not before theyve paid i hope i said l must tell you doctor jones continued todd its getting harder and harder to tolerate this kind of thing im as liberal as the next man but he simply cant be allowed to go around shooting people whenever he pleases after all this isnt the frontier anymore and it is getting very difficult to say nothing of expensive to keep such unfortunate events quiet expensive i said expensive he replied putting his hand into his pocket and jingling his change just like a highclass waiter or bellboy well take care of the expenses later i said in the meantime since it is in both our interests for my only tenant to remain in business i think maybe id better have a little chat with the bouncer in question ill have him sent right in said todd let me ask you something i said to mademoiselle markoff after lieutenant todd had gone to get the bouncer if hes been shooting people right along why didnt you fire him weeks ago i did said mademoiselle markoff but he likes it here hes working for free is he a large man i asked suddenly wondering at the wisdom of this proposed meeting much of a temper no she replied in point of fact hes really quite small fine i said sitting on the rug beside her and lighting one of her cigars then lets solve this little problem once and for all a moment later there was a soft knock at the door come in said mademoiselle markoff the door opened and an oliveskinned little man with sad eyes a dapperlooking suit and slickeddown black hair walked in rodent i exclaimed what the hell are you doing here doctor jones he said in that nasal voice of his i might ask the very same question of a man of the cloth it has been quite some time since we have seen each other but i seem to recall that the circumstances of our parting were not such that i truly wish to continue our relationship im afraid you aint got a hell of a lot of choice in the matter i said im the new landlord whats all this i hear about you shooting up a customer it was an act of selfdefense i assure you he said again snorted mademoiselle markoff what were the circumstances i asked i was climbing up the stairs and a rather large man was coming down and he wouldnt get out of the way so you shot him i demanded what else was i to do asked the rodent with a shrug he was much larger than i am thats it i said thats the whole story and you call that selfdefense certainly said the rodent i view it as preventive selfdefense after all i would hardly have been in any condition to defend myself if he had pushed me down the stairs rodent you just cant go around doing things like that i snapped youre not even on the payroll the very point i should like to discuss with you he said with an apologetic little smile oh said mademoiselle markoff and me in unison yes i have been working for free for the past seven weeks during which time i have had to defend my life on no less than five separate occasions surely i deserve to go back on the payroll after having undergone such privation i dont know exactly how to get this through to you rodent i said but if you dont stop shooting people we aint gonna have no payroll with no warning at all he reached inside his coat and i dove for cover behind mademoiselle markoff when i didnt hear any shots i cautiously raised my head above her ample flanks to see what was going on the rodent was carefully dabbing at his face with a delicate white handkerchief damn it all you got to stop making sudden moves like that i snapped rising to my feet and brushing myself off my deepest apologies said the rodent hiding his face behind the handkerchief i had no desire to scare or startle you now i believe we were talking about my salary i was half inclined to argue the point with him but i figured if i did hed just go reaching into his coat again and since no one could ever be quite sure what hed pull out it made more sense to put him back on the payroll but with one stipulation i told him yes he said gently you shoot anyone else who doesnt take a shot at you first and youre fired you understand i understand he said in a way that led me to think that there was yet another question to be asked like did he agree but i decided to let it pass where do you know him from asked mademoiselle markoff when the rodent had left the room oh i knew him back in daressalaam a couple of years ago i said he tried to get me to finance a highly illegal operation but being a man of strong moral character i managed to resist the temptation how clever of you she purred taking another deep drag on her cigar wouldnt you care to join me again on the rug id sure love to do that mademoiselle markoff i said crossing my fingers behind my back but it really wouldnt look too good me being a man of the cloth and all so whos to know she whispered shooting me a wink that would have given a lesser man nightmares for a month well for starters you got two of your young ladies standing right here swiping at your fair body with their fans i said thats all right she said bubbles is totally trustworthy and zsa zsa is inattentive to a fault id still feel bad about it this being my first night on the job so to speak i said besides i still got lots of work to do such as well first of all starting tomorrow the cock and bull signs are all coming down and this place will be going under the name of the tabernacle of saint luke then ive got to hunt up lieutenant nigel todd and make such arrangements as may be necessary to hush up this unfortunate act of selfdefense that the rodent was undoubtedly forced into against such meager will as he possesses and finally i left a couple of little ladies at the front door to scare away undesirables and the like and i want to make sure they know theyll be welcome any time they want to come around here so as you can see im just gonna be too busy for any romantic entanglements tonight perhaps tomorrow then she said licking her lips with a tongue that could have taken the hide off a rhinoceros why not i said as i left the room i was still coming up with reasons why not when i got hold of lieutenant todd and made such restitution as was required to keep the whole unhappy affair of the rodent under his hat then i introduced myself to the bartender a cadaverous armenian named irving and told him to get a sign painter out the first thing in the morning i took a room in the new stanley hotel tried unsuccessfully to buy the painting of nellie willoughby that they had hanging over the bar and finally turned in for a good nights sleep it seemed like a waste of money since i owned about twenty rooms with beds over at my tabernacle but i just had a feeling that id be much happier in the new stanley until me and mademoiselle markoff came to an understanding betwixt ourselves when i showed up the next afternoon i saw that the signs were already changed when i went into the bar to tell irving what a good job he had done mademoiselle markoff was waiting for me wearing a red gown that would have been roomy on most siamese triplets but that fit her so snugly that i could see the huge mole on her left thigh right through it good morning lucifer she breathed good day to you i said i was wondering if youd like to come up to my office for a few minutes so we can go over some figures she tittered in a voice like unto an opera baritone well id like to i truly would i said but being a man of the cloth and all i think it would be more appropriate for me to start setting up my tabernacle now there wasnt much she could say to that so she settled for offering to help me and then there wasnt much i could say to that so i just thanked her and we went down the hall to the large room that she had put aside for my use it was kind of dirty and needed a new coat of paint and the ceiling was caving in and there were only two chairs but it suited my needs just fine since i thought it might take the preaching business a good four or five years to grow to where i needed better quarters or even more chairs on the other hand it seemed to be the one place where i was reasonably safe from mademoiselle markoffs advances so i decided to throw myself into its remodeling with a vengeance she and i worked side by side replastering the ceiling and staining the walls and putting in a parquet floor and building an altar and getting some stained glass to replace the old dirty windows and building a number of pews so that the room could actually hold about thirty people this took us the better part of two months during which time the rodent didnt shoot anyone else and business was booming lieutenant todd stopped by for his payoff every other night and the police left us alone and the two little ladies kept screaming in glowing detail about what was going on inside the tabernacle of saint luke and pretty soon the editor of the local paper started coming by with lieutenant todd and getting an occasional gift of one kind or another and shortly thereafter we were never again mentioned in the papers in fact everything was going smooth as silk except that i was running out of excuses for keeping out of mademoiselle markoffs room and going over figures with her so i worked an extra week building me a pulpit and when she still kept hanging around i took to preaching a good eight or nine hours a day interspersing my lectures with the latest race results from johannesburg and some soccer scores from cairo so as to appeal to a wider audience i got to admit that we didnt do much offthe street business but most of the girls and some of the customers would wander in from time to time and id tell em what terrible sinners they were and how carnal knowledge was old satans foothold in the world of fast women and shameless men and how theyd well better repent right quick and then theyd go back to their rooms feeling all refreshed and cleansed of soul in fact just sos theyd know the lord was a forgiving type i began pardoning them for future sins as well as past ones kind of getting a couple of pages ahead in the heavenly ledger so to speak it got a little difficult to keep finding new subject matter especially after id whipped through a threeday lecture on solomons seven hundred or so wives and what he probably did with em but every time id think of slipping out for a little liquid refreshment or some other kind of tension easer id look up and thered be mademoiselle markoff sitting in the first pew staring unblinkingly at me i really dont think she missed a single sermon i gave during the whole time the tabernacle of saint luke was in business id been there almost seven months and had just polished off my two hundredth sermon when lieutenant nigel todd looking agitated as all getout stormed into the tabernacle and pulled me off toward a corner jones hes done it again he snapped whos done what i asked your friend the rodent seems to have fallen off the wagon so to speak said todd how did it happen this time he claims it was selfdefense as to who was going to use the sink in the mens room first said todd is the man hurt badly i asked l dont believe he felt the last five bullets at all said todd well at least he aint suffering unduly i said why not bring him in here and let me run through a little funeral prayer or two for him you seem to be missing the point of all this said todd im going to have to arrest the rodent and lock him up for a good long time surely we can work something out i said putting an arm around his shoulder its not as if we want him to keep working here or nothing like that i mean if he shoots enough customers sooner or later were not going to have any live ones left but i sure hate to see him go to jail him being an employee and an old friend of mine and such im not a totally unreasonable man said lieutenant todd starting to jingle the coins in his pocket what exactly did you have in mind for him well it just seems a shame that the government will have to feed and care for him surely there must be something he can do to repay his debt to society whats he good at asked todd well now thats where we got a little problem i admitted what hes mostly good at so far as i can tell is shooting people it may have escaped your notice doctor jones said todd but that is the very talent we tend to arrest people for these days do you ever hang em i asked as my silent partner smacked me right between the eyes with a great big revelation from time to time said todd any law says you cant shoot em instead i said none that i know of admitted todd then why not offer the rodent a job as your official executioner i suggested i have to admit hed be pretty efficient mused todd hed work cheap too i said especially once you outlined the nature of his job and the alternatives to accepting it if hes going to go around shooting people i suppose it does make a certain degree of sense to have him on our side said todd but i just dont know he jingled the coins in his pocket a little louder i pulled out a wad of bills big enough to assuage lieutenant todds doubts had a little chat with the rodent and saw him off on his way to the first honest job hed had in years nothing much of interest happened for the next couple of weeks and i fell back into my established routine then one day i noticed that mademoiselle markoff had put aside her satin wrappings and was now wearing a conservative business suit a couple of days later she started wearing a severely tailored high necked black dress and all her facial makeup was missing a fact which must have thrown two or three notions shops into bankruptcy in one fell swoop then a few days after that she started singing the hymns so loud that the paying customers began complaining i was pleased to see that she was taking my preaching so much to heart but i still kept my distance whenever i was outside of the tabernacle one day though i passed her in the hall and for the first time within my memory she didnt even grab at me this turn of events made my life just about perfect and i determined then and there to check out the performance of some of my tenants just to make sure they werent being more than normally sinful and to offer them dispensation in case they felt a little adventurous so that night after i had completed my evening sermon which as i recall had something to do with the sin of lusting after your neighbors wives when you could be spending your time with some pleasant bachelor ladies at the tabernacle of saint luke i wandered up to the second floor and not wishing to spend too much time reforming all these sinful painted women individually decided to invite three of them into a room at once i was just on the verge of showing them what old onan was missing when suddenly the door burst open and lieutenant nigel todd walked in you aint real strong on knocking or announcing yourself are you brother todd i said irritably wrapping a blanket around myself while the girls scrambled for cover i have no choice doctor jones he said im afraid im going to have to shutter this establishment what the hell are you talking about i demanded and how come you aint jingling your change the way you usually do when we get onto this subject because this isnt something we can work out between ourselves he said ive got a court order closing you down he tossed it onto the bed for me to see but we got nothing but happy satisfied customers i protested whod be low and dastardly enough to have the judge sign something like this ill take credit for it said mademoiselle markoff appearing in the doorway you i said but why youve shown me the light lucifer she said with a strange kind of glow on her face ive been listening to you preach the word for more than half a year now and reading the good book every night and youve shown me the error of my ways what about all these poor innocent girls who aint quite seen the error of their ways yet i demanded how are they gonna make a living if you stop them from selling the one commodity they know anything about im starting a soup kitchen on the outskirts of town said mademoiselle markoff ill be helping poor downtrodden sinners and derelicts on both sides of the counter praise god but what will become of my tabernacle i screamed youve been blessed with the call lucifer she said youll find another tabernacle one that doesnt lead poor young girls and evil lecherous men into a life of sin what life of sin i protested its only just a couple of hours of sin the difference is quantitative not qualitative she said dont you understand lucifer im just doing what youve been telling me to do i aint never told no one to shut this place down i said lieutenant todd this is all just some horrible misunderstanding let me and the mademoiselle here talk things over for an hour or so and everything will be back to normal im afraid that cant be done doctor jones said todd youve got a tenthousandpound levy against your property for being a bawdy house and youre going to have to put up a five thousandpound bond if you want to keep out of jail mademoiselle markoff i pleaded tell him it was all a mistake that would be a lie lucifer she said and now that youve shown me the light i can no longer tell a lie even in a good cause praise god well at least turn over fifteen thousand pounds of my money to me so i can take care of these here legal entanglements and work things out i said i cant she said i dont have a shilling what are you talking about i bellowed weve took in fifty thousand pounds since i been here i gave it all to charity this afternoon right before i went to the courthouse she said the lord wouldnt have approved of my keeping it but what am i going to do i said well ive always wanted to own a tavern and hotel said lieutenant todd ill be happy to purchase the place from you for shall we say fifteen thousand pounds i paid five times that much for it i yelled you werent headed for the hoosegow when you bought it he pointed out think it over doctor jones tell you what ill sweeten the pot by turning my back for twentyfour hours if youre of a mood to jump bail and leave the country well i haggled for half an hour or so but he had me over a barrel and finally i sold him the tabernacle of saint luke for fifteen thousand pounds which left me the shirt on my back and my copy of the good book and not much else by the way said todd as he took his leave of us if any of the girls dont feel like working in a soup kitchen mademoiselle markoff please tell them for me that my hotel can always use maids and waitresses he gave me a wink and walked on down the stairs i hope youll forgive me lucifer said mademoiselle markoff when we were alone thatll take a heap of doing i said miserably but if you were a less convincing preacher none of this would have happened i spent i dont know how many sleepless nights lusting for your body but now that the spirit is with me i can see that youre hardly worth all the thought i gave you thanks a lot i grated no she said thank you for showing me the right and the way i put on my clothes tucked my bible under my arm and an hour later was marching south out of town wishing that just this one time i hadnt been the dynamic forceful interpreter of the word that i unquestionably am and making a solemn vow not to preach about anything except the racier psalms when i established my next tabernacle chapter the elephants graveyard it didnt take me all that long to find another parish i spent a couple of weeks getting clear of british east and found myself in portuguese east africa which was just on the verge of changing its name to mozambique partially in honor of its capital city and partially because the portuguese didnt like swamps and deserts and savages and mosquitoes and snakes and tsetse flies any more than most reasonable people and were pretty busy packing up and moving back to portugal where the worst thing they had to worry about was a viking raid of which there hadnt been none in about nine hundred years give or take a decade anyway i had gotten about twothirds of the way through portuguese east and was planning on heading down to south africa to see if i couldnt borrow a little mission money from emily perrison who was probably emily dobbins by now i made it as far as the zambezi river which may not look like the mississippi or the amazon on the maps but was just as hard to cross especially considering that it had no bridges and about a million crocodiles all of which had a lean and hungry look i was standing on the bank trying to figure out what to do next when a huge canoe loaded with black warriors pulled up just like a taxicab and one of these painted savages gave me a big grin and gestured for me to climb in and take a ride with them thank you kindly brothers i said hopping in and grabbing a seat i must say this is downright neighborly of you i was afraid that i was going to have to start rasslin crocodiles for a living we were happy to help a man of god said the big fellow who had done most of the smiling you are a missionary are you not funny you should mention it i said i happen to be the reverend doctor jones come to spread the word of the lord and otherwise brighten your dull lackluster lives whats for lunch we shall eat when we return to our village said the big guy and after that we would be very happy to learn about your god you sure seem friendly as all getout i said lighting up a cigar and offering him one which he took are you guys zanake or makonde neither he said were mangbetu mangbetu i said i thought you folks lived in the congo there was a food shortage so some of us migrated down here howd you learn to speak english so good weve had some anthropologists come to live with us from time to time he said they never stay very long but weve picked up a smattering of french and english from them i dont mean no insult i said but you look pretty much like any other godless black heathens to me why would they single you out for serious observing and notetaking beats me he shrugged it probably has something to do with our dietary customs yeah i said what do you do that the rest of the tribes around dont do we eat people he said people i repeated such as comes equipped with two arms and two legs and like that he nodded whats your philosophical and gustatory feelings about white meat i asked kind of nervously youre our guest doctor jones he laughed dont look so upset we only eat our enemies viewed that way i could see where it could save a pile of money that would otherwise be spent on grave diggers and would also lengthen the lives of a few innocent goats and fish and as long as sauteed missionary wasnt one of their favorites i figured that i was just a guest and didnt want to upset no applecarts at least not until i knew their bellies were full i found out that the big guys name was samjeba and that he didnt mind my calling him sam especially when i explained that the original samuel was esthers cousin or manservant or chauffeur or something and we spent a lot of time exchanging a batch of upsidedown handshakes and swapping dirty stories during which time i learned a whole lot of new swahili words that just dont tend to crop up in the course of a normal conversation we arrived at the mangbetu village a couple of hours before nightfall the womenfolk were busy cooking up some mighty tender looking spareribs but in the light of our recent conversations i decided to stick to fruits and berries and easily identifiable stuff like that when the meal was over i got up and did a little serious preaching from the song of solomon and i got an outandout standing ovation with a couple of british hip hip hoorays tossed in for good measure when i got up to solomon which goes i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem in fact it took me quite some little time to explain to the more suggestible of the young bucks that jerusalem wasnt some tribe of white women over in the next county but was even farther away than nairobi i couldnt get sam and his people to forsake cannibalism but i did manage to get them to agree to say grace before each meal which was a minor triumph of sorts especially since most of them worshiped a god who had an elephants tusks a womans breasts a lions claws and one hell of a cookbook i remained with the mangbetus for the better part of three months during which time i lost about twenty pounds due to an enforced diet of vegetarianism because i never could be sure quite what kind of steaks they were cooking up at any given time at last i couldnt stand it no more and asked sam if he and a couple of his better bowandarrow men might accompany me on a little hunting trip for klipspringer or duiker or some other kind of inoffensive and fourlegged type of meat he agreed and the four of us set off one sunny morning in search of a little something to fill the needs of the inner man at least it started off sunny but by noontime we ran into some mighty fierce thunderstorms so we wandered off the trail we had been following and went deeper into the jungle to get a little protection from the rain somehow or other we got lost old sams bushcraft not quite being the equal of his talent in the kitchen and we stayed lost throughout the rest of the day and all that night on the morning of the next day we saw a clearing and a valley up ahead so we headed toward it and broke out of the forest in about twenty minutes time there was some kind of smoke or fog rising like it was some prehistoric place or something and the first thing i noticed was all the skeletons what does that look like to you sam i asked pointing off toward the piles of bones dead elephants he said lots of em i agreed walking down to have a closer look some of them still had their tusks and those tusks were as big as anything herbie miller and i ever tried to bring down back in the lado enclave others didnt have none but i wrote it off to their being cows and pups or whatever it is that lady elephants and their children are called you know what this place is i said at last turning to sam and his two companions i wish i did admitted sam then i wouldnt feel so lost this is the lost and fabled elephants burial ground as has been writ up in song and story i exclaimed bad job of burying said sam indicating all the skeletons that were above the ground no you got it all wrong i said this is where the elephants come to die sam took another look around and i could tell he was wondering why anyone would bother coming to such an outoftheway spot to die but when i explained that it probably had something to do with their not wanting to be cooked by their enemies it made a lot more sense to him do you think you could find your way back here if you had to i asked he explained that wed simply mark the trees on the way back to the village and wed have no trouble which was true but it turned out that i had asked him the wrong question a better one being if he knew how to find his way back to the village in the first place but finally we got there after three or four days of hard searching i figured that the very first thing i had to do was stake a claim to the land that held the graveyard and to this end i had sam and a couple of the boys accompany me to the city of beira on the coast since i was sure id never find sams village again without help let alone lead anyone to the graveyard and while the government knew the village existed sam kept moving it around due to various disagreements with the local constabularies concerning the finer points of his dietary laws beria wasnt the most modern city on the continent but it was a seaport and this brought enough money in so that the government could afford to erect a couple of solidlooking brick and mud buildings from which they ran the affairs of the nation which meant they made sure that the ships arrived and left pretty much on schedule one of the nice things about waterfronts is that they imply the existence of waterfront dives and one of the nice things about waterfront dives is that if you strike up enough acquaintances and supply enough free drinks you can eventually get a line on who is the man most likely to do you some good in this case it turned out to be colonel philippe carcosa who had risen to his imposing high rank by the simple expedient of avoiding any form of combat whatsoever while his countrymen were off dying in foreign wars or personal duels of honor colonel carcosa so i was told was a man who was quick to evaluate all the pros and cons of a business proposal and who could be counted upon to act with satisfying swiftness when convinced that a handsome return on his investment could be had by so doing i made an appointment with the colonel and got an audience with him the next morning good morning i said walking into his luxuriously appointed office in my best sunday preaching clothes i am the right reverend doctor lucifer jones pleased to meet you doctor jones he said rising from his polished mahogany desk and taking my hand may i offer you a brandy oh its a little early in the day for brandy me being a man of the cloth and all i told him i think ill settle for a double scotch he grinned and had an orderly bring us each a drink what can i do for you doctor jones he asked not a hell of a lot more than i can do for you colonel carcosa i said lighting up a cigar and offering him one which he took its not often that i entertain the clergy in my offices he said is this in reference to a church or chapel perhaps close i said the property i have in mind happens to be a cemetery catholic or protestant he asked well thats kind of difficult to say i answered truthfully where is this cemetery and what seems to he the problem he asked i cant actually tell you where it is and the problem is that you and me dont own it i said yet and why should you and i ever wish to own a cemetery he asked suddenly alert because you and me cant see no reason whatsoever why we shouldnt be millionaires i told him that is true he said nodding thoughtfully no matter how earnestly i search my heart i simply cannot come up with an acceptable reason now my friend perhaps you might be willing to explain why the possession of this particular cemetery will substantially alter our financial situation certainly i said taking another sip of my drink colonel carcosa i have discovered the lost burial ground of the elephants i didnt even know it was missing he said this is the place where all the elephants go to die i said its just chock full of skeletons most of them loaded down with ivory and it just stands to reason that as long as elephants keep feeling the need to die theyll keep going to the burial ground and adding to the treasure that awaits us there colonel carcosa signaled for his aide no more liquor for doctor jones he said he doesnt seem to be able to handle it but its true i said i saw it with my own eyes this is the silliest story i have ever heard in a long lifetime of hearing silly stories he said im afraid i must ask you to leave wait i cried if i take you there and let you see it yourself are we partners what are you talking about he said we got to buy that graveyard before anyone else stakes a claim i said i aint got no money but i know where it is you dont know where it is but you can put up the money if i can convince you it really exists do we have a deal how far is it from here he asked suspiciously about six days march i said he pulled a map out of his desk mark its location he said i cant i said then how are we to find this mythical graveyard he demanded i got three mangbetus waiting for me outside of town i said they were with me when i discovered it they can show us the way mangbetus he said his eyebrows raised right i said and a godfearing race they are except in matters of diet you know i could arrest you for coming to me with a hare brained scheme like this he said true brother carcosa i said but then id just have to go out and find another partner once you set me free and i truly dont see how that could possibly benefit either of us all right he said come back here tomorrow morning and i will be ready to leave with you but if this graveyard does not exist it is going to go very hard with you doctor jones very hard indeed brother carcosa i said rising and shaking his hand you got yourself a deal i picked him up the next morning and we were joined by sam and the boys when we got a couple of miles west of the city limits i knew he wasnt all that thrilled with the mangbetu tribe but i warned him to keep it under his hat because the very last thing anyone in his right mind would want was to be viewed as an enemy by the mangbetus especially if they had a little mustard and onions handy he took it under advisement and the following six days were kind of routine colonel carcosa had a big map folded up in his backpack and every couple of hours hed pull it out and make certain notations on it when we finally got to sams village he made us spend an extra day there while he checked out various landmarks to make sure he had the place spotted on the map then we spent a couple more days hunting up the graveyard but we finally found it despite sams deficiencies at bushcraft by god doctor jones exclaimed colonel carcosa i must confess that until this minute i really didnt believe you then why did you come along i asked as we moseyed down into the valley if nothing else i could always have turned the mangbetus in for the reward he said sam kind of tensed at that and started looking at the colonel the way a chef looks at a choice piece of tenderloin but the colonel simply smiled back and said of course that wont be necessary now especially in view of the fact that were going to need a nonstop stream of highlypaid porters that soothed sam down a bit and after a while he looked like he might settle for maybe only cutting off two or three of the colonels toes to flavor up a stew or something we walked down to the skeletons and started counting and came up with seven elephants but thats just whats on the surface said the colonel theres no telling how many have sunk under the soft moist ground possibly thousands not only that i pointed out but we might not even be safe standing right here i mean for all we know theres a couple of dozen elephants making their way here right now just to die on this very spot he thought about that for a moment and then walked a few feet away i nodded my approval and told him he looked much safer in his new location well doctor jones he said after a few minutes ive seen enough lets get back to beria and stake a claim to this place before anybody else stumbles onto it that made a lot of sense to me especially since there were a few million army ants discussing combat strategy and logistics a couple of hundred feet away so we went back to the mangbetu village very slowly with the colonel marking things down on his map every half mile or so we rested up for a day and then accompanied only by sam who came along mainly to guide me back after wed claimed the place we returned to beria i took a room in a local hostelry sam hung around a nearby restaurant getting hints on different ways to soften meat and colonel carcosa went to the proper authorities to purchase the tract of land that contained the burial ground he was in a real good mood when we met for dinner did you get it i asked as soon as he had pulled up a chair of course he said no problems i said nobody suspects nothing doctor jones youre not dealing with an amateur he replied smugly the graveyard was in the middle of a privately owned twohundredthousandacre tract of land i purchased the whole thing at five british shillings an acre the whole thing i said but why because if it were known that i had bought one hundred acres or so in the interior of portuguese east africa it would arouse curiosity but two hundred thousand acres it might seem peculiar but no one is going to race out to search every square centimeter of the land to find out what i want with it i opined as to how it made a bit of sense at that and we spent the rest of the evening toasting each others good health and success in the world of high finance the next morning sam and i set out for the graveyard armed with saws and such other equipment as we might need to separate the various tusks from their skeletons we stopped off at the mangbetu village long enough to recruit a little help and for sam to refresh missus sam and then we headed off for the burial ground four of the skeletons had tusks and we removed them and toted them all the way back to mozambique excellent said colonel carcosa when the tusks averaged out at one hundred thirty pounds apiece ive ordered some earth moving equipment which should be here in about four months at which time we can begin digging up all the skeletons that have sunk into the muck and mire it made sense to me and i prepared to spend the next four months loafing and sleeping and enjoying the company of the local ladies but colonel carcosa started getting itchy a few days later and sent me and sam off to pick up the tusks from any new corpses i got back to beria two weeks later with the news that there werent any new corpses thats very odd said the colonel after all its been almost a month since i was there you would think some elephants would have died since then maybe this aint the season for it i suggested and maybe you are being less than honest with me he said accusingly brother carcosa i said i been telling you nothing but gods own truth if you dont believe me come on right now and well march out there together he stared long and hard at me as if he was making up his mind ill trust you for the moment he announced at last but if i should ever find out that you were stealing ivory from our property doctor jones i have the power to make the rest of your life very unpleasant to say nothing of brief getting threatened by your partner can be pretty thirsty work so after he finished talking i moseyed on over to the local pub where i ordered a bottle of beer and started carrying it to a table in the corner well if it aint the reverend lucifer jones hollered a familiar voice i turned and saw capturing clyde calhoun sitting at the bar i sure didnt expect to see you here clyde i said walking over and joining him i figured your circus would be taking you to bucharest and rotterdam and all them other glittering exotic capitals of europe ill be joining the circus in a couple of days said calhoun pouring himself a glass of rye whiskey and offering one to me im just here to ship some survivors back to various zoos in the states well it sure is good to see a friendly face i said hows lord bloomstoke getting along just fine replied calhoun of course ive had to land on him a couple of times about organizing the monkeys but other than that hes doing a right creditable job and how about yourself reverend you ever get that tabernacle i told him the sad story of the tabernacle of saint luke and then he told me the sad story of how he figured out that he had a career waiting for him in the dark continent on the day he accidentally shot the mayors horse back in billings montana and then i told him the sad story of losing the affections of miss emily perrison to major theodore dobbins late of his majestys armed forces and then he told me the sad story of his first five wives weve sure had our share of bad luck aint we clyde i said starting to feel downright weepy we sure have he agreed i dont mean to butt in gents said the bartender but i got a hardluck story to match anything youve got i used to be a hunter like mister calhoun here what happened i asked ordering another beer and pouring two shots of rye into it just to bring out the subtle nuances of its flavor i got flimflammed so bad i had to take this here bartending job to climb out from under a mountain of debts that i had taken on in good faith said the bartender seems this fellow hired me to go to some valley out in the middle of nowhere right next to some cannibal sanctuary about five or six days march from here and offered me a thousand pounds for every elephant i could lure there and shoot then after id spent a couple of weeks fighting off mosquitoes and hornets and tsetse flies and black mambas and the like and had actually shot a batch of elephants i came back to town here and wrote notes against the money i was owed but the son of a bitch took off and i never saw him or heard from him again how much did he owe you i asked with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach seven thousand pounds said the bartender and of course we were so far out in the middle of the bush he knew there was no way for me and my one gun bearer to bring any of that ivory back to civilization did he say why he wanted you to shoot the elephants asked calhoun i gather hed just bought a couple hundred thousand acres at a penny an acre or some such ridiculous price and he seemed to think that leaving a bunch of dead elephants at this particular spot would make his real estate appreciate i told him and told him that ivory aint like flowers and that you cant just leave it on the ground and hope itll take root and multiply but he just kind of chuckled and said he was a patient man and that sooner or later someone would be impressed by the fact that id killed all them elephants i dunno i guess he thought shooting elephants in that stupid little valley would make it a national historic shrine or something this fellers name didnt happen to have a germanic sound to it did it i asked feeling kind of weak about the knees sure as hell did said the bartender what was it i asked von horst he replied damn i moaned i knew it yep erich von horst it was continued the bartender ill remember that name to my dying day you got lots of company i said i explained to capturing clyde that i suddenly remembered that i had urgent business elsewhere and made a beeline toward sams favorite restaurant where i told him that we should give serious thought to leaving the country at the earliest possible opportunity like right that moment he told me that wed be better off stopping by his village one last time so he could pick up some warriors to defend us against the denizens of the jungle and take along enough women to keep us all happy i told him that i appreciated the thought but right now i was a little more concerned with one particular denizen of the portuguese east african government he told me that hed like to accommodate me but it wouldnt be fair to the mangbetu tribe as a whole for him to leave the country without sharing his newfound cooking knowledge with them well i could see i wasnt going to talk him out of it and it made more sense to start walking toward the village right away than to spend all night standing in the street arguing so i fell into step and we reached the village some six days later sam conducted a threehour graduate cooking seminar gathered the people he thought wed be most in need of and headed off toward tanganyika we must have been within two miles of the border when a group of about twenty portuguese soldiers all armed to the teeth intercepted us sam was willing to fight to the death but i explained to him that i had a feeling that the soldiers werent really after the mangbetus the soldier nearest to us nodded so i wished sam and his people bon appetit as they retreated into the bush my hands were chained behind me and i was marched all the way back to beria where i spent nine days in jail and was then brought to the office of an elderly gentleman named alfredo montenegro who happened to hold the position of chief justice ah doctor jones he said i have been wondering exactly what you looked like now at long last i have the pleasure of making your acquaintance its a pleasure you could have had eight and a half days sooner as far as im concerned i told him you led us a merry little chase he noted pleasantly there were times when i despaired of ever capturing you come to think of it how did you know wed be where we were i asked most armies travel on their stomachs doctor jones he said let us say that a cannibalistic army is just a tad easier to trace than certain others might be poor heathen must of backslid i said sam promised me they were only going to practice it as a ritual eating can be as ritualistic as most things noted montenegro but here you are safe and sound in beria so why bother yourself with how you came to be here true enough i said but perhaps you might tell me why a man of the cloth who never meant no harm to nobody should have been held in durance vile for lo these many days my dear doctor jones he said we may be an old colonial power but we are not yet senile when we discovered that a block of two hundred thousand acres had changed hands we started piercing through the corporate veil and came up with your friend colonel carcosa we discovered in tracing back over his actions that he had spent a considerable amount of time in your company and began reconstructing what you two had been up to it all fell into place after we had a little chat with a fellow countryman of yours a circus owner who thought he was helping your cause and incriminating a gentleman with a germanic name who is of no importance to this case well if you know all about it i replied then you know that we were flimflammed ourselves and that there aint no such thing as an elephants graveyard so that ought to let us off the hook right wrong he thundered doctor jones conspiracy with intent to defraud is every bit as much a criminal offense as fraud itself and is punishable under very stringent laws as your friend the former officer is currently finding out you mean youre going to lock me up for a deal that cost me and my partner a million shillings i demanded we would prefer not to he said after all you are an american citizen and we dont wish to cause your government any distress or embarrassment well then just let me go and well let bygones be bygones and ill forget the whole thing ever happened i said magnanimously its not as easy as all that said montenegro your presence is no longer desired in portuguese east africa never fear i said ill just take my copy of the good book and such members of my mangbetu flock as remain loyal to me in my hour of need and clear out lock stock and barrel im afraid thats out of the question he said shaking his head slowly whats the problem i said theres lots of other countries around thatd be proud to have a missionary preaching the word to the poor uneducated heathen doctor jones he said slowly while you were our ah guest we made certain inquiries of our neighboring nations concerning their reaction should we decide to expel you and i said you are wanted in south africa bechuanaland and the transvaal for selling fraudulent treasure maps there is a warrant out for your arrest in egypt for slave trading and certain illegal practices involving a mummy you are wanted in morocco and algeria for grand larceny involving the theft of a diamond known as the lions tooth but i didnt steal it i protested hell i didnt even know i had it please dont interrupt you are wanted in the lado enclave and uganda for ivory poaching you are wanted for removing certain national treasures in the form of precious stones from nyasaland the nation of southwest africa has issued a warrant for your arrest for killing whales without a license a series of misunderstandings nothing more i said let me continue he said you are wanted in kenya for operating a bawdy house the congo has issued a warrant for your arrest for possible complicity in the disappearance of a gentleman named burley rourke the sudan wishes to speak to you about slave trading and impersonating a british officer and war hero and tanganyika is after you for consorting with known criminals he paused and stared at me frankly doctor jones i wonder where you find the energy to get through the day how about rhodesia i said i aint never been there both rhodesias have extradition treaties with all of the nations i have mentioned then what are you going to do with me i asked it is my opinion that the entire continent of africa will be better off without your particular brand of salvation he said slowly therefore if you will agree to accept passage out of here tomorrow morning ill see to it that you are placed aboard a ship before any other african government can officially request that we detain you i dont see as to how ive got much of a choice i said as long as ive got to go brother montenegro how about getting me on a boat today sos i dont have to spend another night in jail nothing would make me happier than getting you out of beria today he said but the only passenger ship currently in port is the dying quail and for reasons i can only guess at they refuse to allow you aboard so i spent my last night in africa pretty much the same way i had spent some of my first ones my spirits were at an alltime low when they took me to the ship the next afternoon id made three or four quick fortunes only to be gulled out of them by sinful godless men and i had even had my beloved tabernacle ripped from my hands by a cruel and unfeeling fate eli eli lama sabachthani i muttered as i started climbing up the gangplank without a penny to my name and carrying no luggage except my wellworn copy of the good book i paused halfway between shore and ship and turned to take a last look at the dark continent id met a lot of interesting folk there and done most of them more good than they had done me if it hadnt been for me and me alone herbie miller and the rodent would still be looking for jobs and the dutchman ali ben ishak major theodore dobbins ishmael bledsoe and luthor christian would all still be hunting for spouses rosepetal schultz would still be selling her dubious services in the back alleys of cairo friday would be wearing a loincloth and living out in the bush lord bloomstoke would still be hiding from his creditors capturing clyde calhoun would have lowered the worlds gorilla population by half and mademoiselle markoff wouldnt have seen the glory and the light all in all i decided it wasnt a bad four years work at that id left my mark on a whole bunch of previously worthless lives and i was still young and vigorous and with my whole life ahead of me you can keep this damned hellhole von horst i hollered into the wind im going off to strange new lands where a god fearing christian can still make an honest living i climbed up the rest of the gangplank and was about to hunt up my cabin when my eyes fell on one of the passengers a vision of loveliness who looked like a redheaded version of rosepetal schultz and the human spirit glorious and unquenchable thing that it is began to soar within me once again especially after i saw the size of the diamonds on her necklace i stopped to introduce myself and offer her any form of spiritual comfort or uplifting that might appeal to her she giggled and agreed to discuss the matter more fully over dinner and by the time the voyage was over we had become fast friends in fact truth to tell it was occasionally a race between us to see just which of us was the faster we landed in the far exotic orient where sinful and mysterious cities like hong kong and macao and singapore and shanghai all filled with godless men and women and dens of vice and rebel armies and the like were just waiting for a handsome young buck like myself to come and bring the word to them a task to which i dedicated the next few years of my life with considerable success but that of course is another story
