the ghost of mohammed din clark ashton smith ill wager a hundred rupees that you wont stay there overnight said nicholson it was late in the afternoon and we were seated on the veranda of my friends bungalow in the begum suburb at hyderabad our conversation had turned to ghosts on which subject i was at the time rather skeptical and nicholson after relating a number of bloodcurdling stories had finished by remarking that a nearby house which was said to be haunted would give me an excellent chance to put the matter to the test done i answered laughing its no joking matter said my friend seriously however if you really wish to encounter the ghost i can easily secure you the necessary permission the house a sixroomed bungalow owned by one yussuf au borah is tenanted only by the spirit who appears to regard it as his exclusive property two years ago it was occupied by a moslem merchant named mohammed din and his family and servants one morning they found the merchant dead stabbed through the heart and no trace of his murderer whose identity still remains unrevealed mohammed dins people left and the place was let to a parsee up from bombay on business he vacated the premises abruptly about midnight and told a wild tale the next morning of having encountered a number of disembodied spirits describing the chief one as mohammed din several other people took the place in turn but their occupancy was generally of short duration all told tales similar to the parsees gradually it acquired a bad reputation and the finding of tenants became impossible have you ever seen the ghost yourself i asked yes i spent a night or rather part of one there for i went out of the window about one oclock my nerves were not strong enough to stand it any longer i wouldnt enter the place again for almost any sum of money nicholsons story only confirmed my intention of occupying the haunted house armed with a firm disbelief in the supernatural and a still firmer intention to prove it all rot i felt myself equal to all the ghosts native and otherwise in india of my ability to solve the mystery if there were any i was quite assured my friend said nicholson to yussuf ali borah an hour later wishes to spend a night in your haunted bungalow the person addressed a fat little moslem gentleman looked at me curiously the house is at your service sahib he said i presume that nicholson sahib has told you the experiences of the previous tenants i replied that he had if the whole thing is not a trumpedup story there is doubtless some trickery afoot said i and i warn you that the trickster will not come off unharmed i have a loaded revolver and shall not hesitate to use it if i meet any disembodied spirits yussufs only answer was to shrug his shoulders he gave us the keys and we set out for the bungalow which was only a few minutes walk distant night had fallen when we reached it nicholson unlocked the door and we entered and lighting a lamp i had brought with me set out on a tour of inspection the furniture consisted chiefly of two charpoys three tabourets an old divan quite innocent of cushions a broken punkah a threelegged chair and a dilapidated rug everything was covered with dust the shutters rattled disconsolately and all the doors creaked the other rooms were meagrely furnished i could hear rats running about in the dark there was a compound adjoining filled with rank reed and a solitary pipal tree nicholson said that the ghost generally appeared in one of the rooms opening upon it and this i selected as the one in which to spend the night it was a fitting place for ghosts to haunt the ceiling sagged listlessly and the one charpoy which it contained had a wobbly look sleep well said nicholson you will find the atmosphere of this spiritridden place most conducive to slumber rats said i yes there are plenty of rats here he answered as he went out placing the lamp on a tabouret i lay down with some misgivings as to its stability on the charpoy happily these proved unfounded and laying my revolver close at hand i took out a newspaper and began to read several hours passed and nothing unusual happened the ghost failed to materialize and about eleven with my fine skepticism greatly strengthened and feeling a trifle ashamed concerning the hundred rupees which my friend would have to hand over the next morning i lay down and tried to go to sleep i had no doubt that my threat about the revolver to yussuf ali borah had checked any plans for scaring me that might have been entertained scarcely were my eyes closed when all the doors and windows which had been creaking and rattling all evening took on renewed activity a light breeze had sprung up and one shutter which hung only by a single hinge began to drum a tune on the wall the rats scuttled about with redoubled energy and a particularly industrious fellow gnawed something in the further corner for about an hour it was manifestly impossible to sleep i seemed to hear whisperings in the air and once thought that i detected faint footsteps going and coming through the empty rooms a vague feeling of eeriness crept upon me and it required a very strong mental effort to convince myself that these sounds were entirely due to imagination finally the breeze died down the loose shutter ceased to bang the rat stopped gnawing and comparative quiet being restored i fell asleep two hours later i woke and taking out my watch saw though the lamp had begun to burn dimly that the hands pointed to two oclock i was about to turn over when again i heard the mysterious footsteps this time quite audibly they seemed to approach my room but when i judged them to be in the next apartment ceased abruptly i waited five minutes in a dead silence with my nerves on edge and my scalp tingling then i became aware that there was something between me and the opposite wall at first it was a dim shadow but as i watched it darkened into a body a sort of phosphorescent light emanated from it surrounding it with pale radiance the lamp flared up and went out but the figure was still visible it was that of a tall native dressed in flowing white robes and a blue turban he wore a bushy beard and had eyes like burning coals of fire his gaze was directed intently upon me and i felt cold shivers running up and down my spine i wanted to shriek but my tongue seemed glued to the roof of my mouth the figure stepped forward and i noticed that the robe was red at the breast as though with blood this then was the ghost of mohammed din nicholsons story was true and for a moment my conviction that the supernatural was all nonsense went completely to pieces only momentarily however for i remembered that i had a revolver and the thought gave me courage perhaps it was a trick after all and anger arose in me and a resolve not to let the trickster escape unscathed i raised the weapon with a quick movement and fired the figure being not over five paces distant it was impossible to miss but when the smoke had cleared it had not changed its position it began to advance making no sound and in a few moments was beside the charpoy with one remaining vestige of courage i raised my revolver and pulled the trigger three times in succession but without visible effect i hurled the weapon at the figures head and heard it crash against the opposite wall an instant later the apparition though visible was without tangibility now it began to disappear very slowly at first it faded then more rapidly until i could make out only the bare outlines another instant and all was gone but the outline of one hand which hung motionless in the air i got up and made a step towards it then stopped abruptly for the outlines again began to fill in the hand to darken and solidify now i noticed something i had not before seen a heavy gold ring set with some green gem probably an emerald appeared to be on the middle finger the hand began to move slowly past me towards the door opening into the next apartment lighting the lamp i followed all fear being thrown aside and desiring to find the explanation of the phenomenon i could hear faint footfalls beneath the hand as though the owner though invisible were still present i followed it through the adjoining apartment and into the next where it again stopped and hung motionless one finger was pointed toward the further corner where stood a tabouret or stand impelled i think by some force other than my own volition i went over and lifting the tabouret found a small wooden box covered with dust beneath turning about i saw that the hand had disappeared taking the box with me i returned to my room the thing was made of very hard wood and in size was perhaps ten inches in length by eight in width and four in height it was light and the contents rustled when i shook it i guessed them to be letters or papers but having nothing to pry the box open with i concluded to wait until morning before trying to strange as it may seem i soon fell asleep you would naturally think that a man would not feel inclined to slumber immediately after encountering a disembodied spirit i can give no explanation of it the sun was streaming through the window when i awoke and so cheerful and matteroffact was the broad daylight that i wondered if the events of the night were not all a dream the presence of the box however convinced me that they were not nicholson came in and appeared much surprised and a trifle discomfited to find me still in possession well he inquired what happened what did you see i told him what had occurred and produced the box as proof an hour afterwards nicholson with a short native sword and considerable profanity was trying to pry the thing open he finally succeeded within were a number of closelywritten sheets of paper and some letters most of which were addressed to mohammed din the papers were mostly in the form of memoranda and business accounts such as would be made by a merchant they were written in execrable urdu hopelessly jumbled together and though all were dated it was no small task to sort them out the letters were mostly regarding business affairs but several which were written in a very fair hand were from a cousin of mohammed dins one ali bagh an agra horsetrader these too with one exception were commonplace enough nicholson knitted his brows as he read it and then handed it to me the greater part being of little interest has escaped my memory but i recollect that the last paragraph ran thus i do not understand how you came by the knowledge nor why you wish to use it to ruin me it is all true if you have any love for me forbear what does that mean asked nicholson what secret did mohammed din possess that he could have used to ruin his cousin we went through the memoranda carefully and near the bottom found the following dated april according to our notation today i found the letters which i have long been seeking they are ample proof of what i have long known but have hitherto been unable to substantiate that ali bagh is a counterfeiter the chief of a large band i have but to turn them over to the police and he will be dragged away to jail there to serve a term of many years it will be good revenge part compensation at least for the injuries he has done me that explains ali baghs letter said nicholson mohammed din was boastful enough to write to him telling him that he knew of his guilt and intended to prove it next were several sheets in a different hand and signed mallek khan mallek khan it seemed was a friend of ali baghs and the sheets were in the form of a letter but being without fold it was quite evident they had not been posted the communication related to certain counterfeiting schemes and the names of a number of men implicated appeared this plainly was the proof alluded to by mohammed din and which he had threatened his cousin to turn over to the police there was nothing else of interest save the following in mohammed dins hand dated april th tomorrow i shall give the papers to the authorities i have delayed too long and was very foolish to write to ali bagh i passed a man in the street today who bore a resemblance to my cousin i could not be sure but if he is here then may allah help me for he will hesitate at nothing what followed was illegible on the night of april st said nicholson mohammed din was killed by a person or persons unknown he paused and then went on this ali bagh is a man with whom i have had some dealings in horses and an especially vicious crook it was that he got three hundred rupees out of me for he has a bad reputation as a horsedealer and the agra police have long been patiently seeking evidence of his implication in several bold counterfeiting schemes mallek khan one of his accomplices was arrested tried and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment but refused to turn states evidence on ali bagh the police are convinced that ali bagh was as much if not more implicated than mallek khan but they can do nothing for lack of proof the turning over of these papers however as poor mohammed din would have done had he lived will lead to his arrest and conviction it was ali bagh who killed mohammed din i am morally convinced his motive of course being to prevent the disclosure of his guilt your extraordinary experience last night and the murdered mans papers point to it yet we can prove nothing and your tale would be laughed at in court some blank sheets remained in the bottom of the box and my friend tilted them out as he spoke they fluttered to the veranda and something rolled out from amongst them and lay glittering in the sunshine it was a heavy gold ring set with an emerald the very same that i had seen upon the apparitions finger several hours before a week or so later as the result of the papers that nicholson sent to the agra police accompanied by an explanatory note one ali bagh borsetrader found himself on trial charged with counterfeiting it was a very short trial his character and reputation going badly against him and it being proven that he was the leader of the gang of which mallek khan was thought to be a member he was sentenced to a somewhat longer term in jail than his accomplice
