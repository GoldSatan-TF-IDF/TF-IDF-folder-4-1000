before the worms turned mean before they slithered out to get their revenge todd barstow had a great time with them todd collected worms he built a worm farm in his basement he studied them he played with them he did experiments with them sometimes he carried them around with him sometimes he scared people with them especially his sister regina he liked to dangle the long purple ones in front of reginas face sometimes he dropped them down her back or into her long brown hair he liked to torture reginas best friend too her name was beth baker and she always screamed a high squeaky scream whenever todd surprised her with a big slimy worm youre totally gross todd beth would squeal this always made todd very happy todds best friend danny fletcher didnt really understand why todd was so interested in worms but danny did understand how much fun it was to surprise people and make them scream so he spent a lot of time with todd in fact the two of them were almost always together they even sat together in miss grants class where they whispered a lot planning what to do next with todds worms todd didnt look at all mischievous in fact he usually had a very serious expression on his face he had dark brown eyes under short wavy brown hair no one ever saw his hair it was always covered by the silverandblack raiders cap he wore day and night he was tall and skinny his mother said he was as skinny as a worm todd never thought that was funny he took worms seriously danny looked more like a joker he had a round chubby face under curly red hair and a really goofy grin his round blue eyes always lit up when todd was about to spring a big wet worm on an unsuspecting victim whenever todd succeeded in making someone scream in surprise danny would toss back his head let out a highpitched cheer and slap todd hard on the back with his chubby freckled hand then the two of them would screech with laughter roll around on the floor and enjoy their victory they had a great time with worms but whenever anyone asked todd why he collected them and why he was so interested in them todds expression would turn serious and hed say because i want to be a scientist when i grow up how many worms do you have someone asked him not enough he replied he was always digging up more looking for champions he liked them long and purple and kind of fat and squishy squishy was very important sunday night it had rained the ground was still wet as todd and regina walked to school on monday morning todd knew the worms would all be coming up for air he found danny at the water fountain outside their classroom danny had a finger pressed over the fountain spout and when kids passed by he made the water squirt all over them todd lowered his raiders cap over his forehead as he leaned close to danny meet me behind second base on the playground he whispered as soon as the lunch bell rings danny nodded he didnt have to ask why he knew that todds favorite place to dig up fresh worms was the bare patch of ground behind second base on the softball diamond the ground there was soft and rich and after a good rain the two boys could shovel up ten to fifteen worms without even trying todd kept a gardening shovel in his locker as well as a small metal bucket with a lid he was always ready to collect worms when the time was right in class that morning everyone was talking about the big science expo to be held in the gym on saturday some kids already had their projects done debby brewster was bragging about how she was going to win the new computer the grand prize by making electricity someone shouted out go fly a kite and everyone laughed the whole class was tired of debbys constant bragging todds project was just about finished it had worms in it of course it was a worm house a little house todds father had helped him build about the size of a dollhouse one side was cut away and covered with a pane of glass so you could see in the house was filled with dirt and you could see all of the worms a whole worm family crawling from room to room dannys project was really boring he was building the solar system out of balloons he wanted to share todds project and work on it with him but todd wouldnt let him i dont want to share the computer todd had said but i helped you dig up the worms danny protested i dug up most of them todd replied and so todd forced danny to do his own project danny blew up differentcolored balloons for all the planets and taped them on a big black sheet of oaktag very boring what makes you so sure youre going to win the grand prize danny asked todd as he hurried to catch up with him on the playground at lunchtime i checked out the other projects todd replied my project is the only one with real living creatures except for heathers snails heather has done a lot of experiments with her snails danny commented so what todd snapped snails are for babies we had snails in first grade no one cares about snails in sixth grade no way they can compete with worms i guess youre right danny replied scratching his red hair they squatted down as they reached the bare spot behind second base todd handed danny his spare shovel the playground was empty everyone else was inside eating lunch the ground was still soft and wet worms were poking their heads up from little puddles one long worm crawled on top of the dirt the rain makes them all come up said todd beginning to dig this is excellent he didnt know what kind of trouble was waiting under the ground look out you cut that one in two todd warned danny grinned so what now youve got two little ones but i only like big ones todd replied carefully sliding his shovel under a long fat worm how many more do you need my stomach is growling danny complained glancing back at the long redbrick school building just a few more todd said lowering the fat worm into the bucket hes a squirmer isnt he danny groaned everyone else is eating lunch and im out here digging in the mud its for science todd said seriously this one is as big as a snake did you ever think of collecting snakes danny asked no todd replied quickly digging deep into the mud no way why not because i like worms todd said whats the real reason danny demanded my parents wont let me todd muttered the two boys continued to dig for another few minutes until the ground started to rumble danny dropped his shovel whats that he asked huh todd didnt seem to notice the ground rumbled a little harder this time everything shook todd pitched forward dropping onto his hands and knees he gazed up at danny surprised hey dont push me i didnt danny protested then what todd started but the ground shook again and the dirt made a soft cracking sound i i dont like this danny stammered without another word both boys started to run but the ground trembled again and the cracking sound beneath their sneakers grew louder closer earthquake todd screamed earthquake todd and danny sprinted across the field and the playground and burst into the lunchroom both boys had red faces both of them were breathing hard earthquake todd shouted its an earthquake chairs scraped conversations stopped everyone turned to stare at the two of them duck under the tables danny screamed shrilly quick everyone the ground is shaking earthquake earthquake everyone just laughed no one moved no one wanted to fall for a dumb practical joke todd spotted beth and regina across the lunchroom at the window he and danny darted over to them get away from the window todd warned the ground is cracking apart danny cried reginas mouth dropped open she didnt know whether to believe them or not regina the worrier was always ready to believe a disaster waited just around the corner but all the other kids in the huge lunchroom were laughing their heads off we dont get earthquakes in ohio beth said simply making a disgusted face at todd but but but todd sputtered didnt you feel it danny demanded breathlessly his round chubby face still bright red didnt you feel the ground shake we didnt feel anything beth replied didnt you hear it todd cried i i was so freaked i dropped all my worms he sank into the chair next to his sister no one believes you its a dumb joke todd regina told him better luck next time guys but but regina turned away from her sputtering brother and started talking to beth again as i was saying his head is way too big for his body he looks okay to me beth replied no well have to cut his head off regina insisted frowning into her bowl of noodle soup major surgery beth asked are you sure if we cut his head off itll show it really will but if his head is too big what choice do we have regina whined huh what are you talking about todd demanded what about the earthquake todd were talking about our science fair project beth said impatiently yeah go out and play in the earthquake regina snapped weve got problems with christopher robin todd snickered what a dumb name for a bird regina stuck out her tongue at him and then turned her back she and beth began discussing their project again they both agreed they probably should have tried something a little easier and smaller they were building an enormous robin out of papiermвchй it was supposed to be lifelike in every detail except size but the girls quickly discovered that papiermвchй isnt the most lifelike material around it was hard to get the wings to stick to the body it was even harder to get the huge round body to stand on the spindly wooden legs and now regina was convinced that the birds head was much too big for its body they had used an entire quart of orange paint on the birds chest now if they had to cut the head off and make a new one the paint job would be ruined maybe we could just shave a little off the top beth suggested taking the last potato chip from her bag and crinkling the bag between her hands can i have some of your soup you can finish it regina replied sliding the bowl across the table im not very hungry theres going to be an aftershock todd warned staring out the window yeah theres always an aftershock after an earthquake danny agreed i cant believe youre sitting here calmly talking about your dumb project todd said its not a dumb project beth replied angrily todd go eat worms regina exclaimed it was her favorite thing to say to her brother she said it at least ten times a day beth is already eating worms todd said gazing down at the bowl of soup danny laughed give me a break todd beth muttered rolling her eyes no really todd insisted what kind of soup is that chicken noodle beth replied warily she took a spoonful slurping the soup off the spoon well theres a worm in your soup todd said with a serious face todd youre not funny beth replied give up want to bet todd challenged bet what do you mean bet beth said ill bet you a dollar theres a worm in your soup todd told her his dark eyes lighting up danny leaned across the table a wide grin frozen on his chubby face yummm he said licking his lips a big fat purple one can i have a taste you guys are jerks regina muttered bet a dollar todd challenged ignoring his sister sure its a bet beth said she reached across the table and shook todds hand to seal the bet then she ran the soup spoon through the bowl several times to show him there was no worm todd reached under the table then a smile crossed his face as he brought his hand up and dropped a fat purple worm into beths soup the worm wriggled and squirmed as it hit the hot soup oooh gross beth screamed danny let out a loud laugh and slapped todd gleefully on the back nearly knocking todd from the chair pay up beth todd demanded you lost the bet you guys are sick regina murmured making a disgusted face forcing herself not to look into the soup bowl gross gross beth was shrieking the worm slipped and swam through the noodles you said you dropped your worms outside regina accused angrily todd shrugged a big grin on his face i lied danny laughed even harder he pounded the table gleefully with his fists making the soup bowl bounce up and down hey suddenly todds smile faded he stared out of the lunchroom window at the playground look he hit dannys shoulder then pointed out toward second base to the bare spot behind the base whats going on out there he cried todd walked over to the window and peered out pressing his nose against the glass what is patrick mackay doing in my wormdigging spot he demanded angrily danny stepped beside todd he squinted out into the gray afternoon are you sure thats patrick mackay the sky darkened as the low clouds gathered the boy on the playground was half covered by shadow but todd recognized him anyway that snobby stuckup rich kid patrick mackay he was bent over the bare spot of mud behind second base working feverishly what is he doing out there todd repeated thats my best worm spot hes digging up worms too regina declared from the table huh todd spun around to find his sister smirking at him patrick is digging up worms for the science expo she told him unable to hide her joy hes doing a worm project too but he cant todd sputtered in a high shrill voice whoa what a copycat danny declared he cant do a worm project im doing the worm project todd insisted turning back to stare at patrick through the glass its a free country regina replied smugly she and beth laughed and slapped each other high fives they were enjoying seeing todd squirm for a change but hes not into worms todd continued very upset he doesnt collect worms he doesnt study worms hes just copying me look at him digging in your spot danny murmured shaking his head bitterly patrick is a nice guy beth remarked he doesnt act like a jerk and put worms in peoples soup hes a jerk todd insisted angrily staring hard out the window hes a total jerk hes a copycat jerk danny added his worm project is going to be better than yours regina teased him todds dark eyes burned into his sisters you know what it is you know what patricks project is regina had a smug smile on her lips she tossed back her brown hair then she made a zipper sign moving her fingers across her lips ill never tell she said what is it todd demanded tell me regina shook her head tell me beth todd insisted narrowing his eyes menacingly at beth no way beth replied glancing merrily at regina then ill ask him myself todd declared come on danny the two boys started running through the lunchroom they were nearly to the door when todd ran into their teacher miss grant was carrying her lunch tray high over her head stepping around a group of kids in the aisle todd just didnt see her he bumped her from behind she uttered a cry of surprise and her tray flew out of her hands the tray and the plates clattered loudly onto the floor and her food salad and a bowl of spaghetti dropped around her feet what is your hurry young man she snapped at todd uh sorry todd murmured it was the only reply he could think of miss grant bent to examine her brown shoes which were now orange covered with wet clumps of spaghetti it was an accident todd said impatiently fiddling with his raiders cap it sure was the teacher replied coldly perhaps i should speak to you after school about why we dont run in the lunchroom perhaps todd agreed then he bolted past her running out the door faster than he had ever run cool move ace danny exclaimed running beside him it wasnt my fault todd told him she stepped in front of me the bell is going to ring danny warned as they made their way out the back door i dont care todd replied breathlessly ive got to find out what that copycat is doing with worms patrick was still bent over the mud behind second base he was scooping up worms with a silvery trowel that looked brandnew then dropping them into a metal bait can he was a slim goodlooking boy with wavy blond hair and blue eyes he had started school in september his family had moved to ohio from pasadena he was always telling everyone how california was so much better he didnt brag about how rich he was but he wore designer jeans and his mother brought him to school every morning in a long white lincoln so todd and the others at william tecumseh sherman middle school figured it out patrick was in reginas class a few weeks after school started hed had a big birthday party and invited everyone in his class including regina she reported that patrick had a whole carnival with rides and everything in his back yard todd pretended he didnt care that he wasnt invited the sky grew even darker as danny and todd stood over patrick on the playground what are you doing patrick todd demanded digging patrick replied glancing up from his work digging up worms todd asked his hands pressed against the waist of his jeans patrick nodded he started digging again he pulled up a long dark brown one that todd would have loved to own im doing a worm project todd told him i know patrick replied concentrating on his work me too what is it danny chimed in whats your project patrick patrick didnt reply he dug up a tiny pale worm examined it and tossed it back whats your project tell us todd demanded you really want to know patrick asked raising his blue eyes to them the wind ruffled his blond hair but the hair immediately fell back into place todd felt a raindrop on his shoulder then one on the top of his head whats your project todd repeated okay okay patrick said wiping dirt off his hands ill tell you my project is the class bell rang the sharp clang cut through the rising wind the rain started to patter loudly against the ground weve got to go in danny urged tugging at todds sleeve wait todd said his eyes on patrick tell me now he insisted but well be late danny insisted tugging at todd again and were getting soaked patrick climbed to his feet i think ive got all the worms i need he shook wet dirt off the silvery trowel so what is your worm project todd repeated ignoring the pattering rain and dannys urgent requests to get back inside the school patrick grinned at him revealing about three hundred perfect white teeth im teaching them to fly he said huh im putting cardboard wings on them and teaching them to fly wait till you see it its a riot he burst out laughing danny leaned close to todd is he for real he whispered of course not todd shot back dont be a jerk danny hes goofing on us hey youre not funny danny told patrick angrily were late guys lets get going patrick said his grin fading he started toward the school building but todd moved quickly to block his path tell me the truth patrick what are you planning to do patrick started to reply but a low rumbling sound made him stop they all heard it a muffled roar that made the ground shake the worm can fell out of patricks hand his blue eyes opened wide in surprise and fear the rumbling gave way to a loud cracking noise it sounded as if the whole playground were splitting apart whwhats happening patrick stammered run todd screamed as the ground trembled and shook run for your life why are you so late whereve you been in another earthquake regina teased haha todd said bitterly danny and i werent making it up it happened again and patrick was there too how come no one else felt it regina demanded i had the radio on after school and there was nothing about an earthquake on the news it was nearly five oclock todd had found his sister in the garage up on an aluminum ladder working hard on her giant robin somehow she had managed to get clumps of papiermвchй in her hair and down the front of her tshirt i dont want to talk about the earthquake todd muttered stepping into the garage i know im right the rain had ended just before school let out but the driveway was still puddled with water his wet sneakers squeaked as he made his way to reginas ladder wheres beth he asked she had to go get her braces tightened regina told him concentrating on smoothing out the papiermвchй beak she let out a loud groan i cant get this beak smooth todd kicked dejectedly at an old tire that leaned against the garage wall look out regina called a wet clump of papiermвchй landed at todds feet with a plop you missed me he cried ducking away so whereve you been regina asked miss grant kept me after school she gave me a long lecture about what regina stopped to examine her work i dont know something about running in school todd replied how are you going to get this dumb bird to the science fair carry it regina answered without hesitating its big but its really light i dont suppose you would help beth and me i dont suppose todd told her wrapping his hand around the broomstick that formed one bird leg hey get your paws off regina cried leave it alone todd obediently backed away youre just jealous because christopher robin is going to win the computer regina said listen reggie youve got to tell me what patrick mackay is doing for his worm project todd pleaded youve got to she climbed down off the ladder she saw the big worm in todds hand whats that for she demanded nothing todds cheeks turned pink you planned to drop that down my back didnt you regina accused him no i was just taking it for a walk todd told her he laughed youre a creep regina said shaking her head dont you ever get tired of those dumb worms no todd replied so tell me whats patricks project you want to hear the truth regina asked yeah the truth is i dont know his sister confessed i really dont know what hes doing todd stared hard at her for a long moment you really dont she crossed her heart i really dont know todd suddenly had an idea where does he live he asked eagerly the question caught regina by surprise why danny and i can go over there tonight todd said and ill ask him what hes doing youre going to go to his house regina asked ive got to find out todd exclaimed ive worked so hard on my worm house reggie i dont want patrick the copycat to do something better regina eyed her brother thoughtfully and what will you do for me if i tell you where he lives a grin spread over todds face he held up the worm if you tell me i wont put this down your back haha regina replied rolling her eyes youre a real pal todd tell me he insisted eagerly grabbing her by the shoulders okay okay dont have a cow patrick lives on glen cove regina replied i think the number is its a huge old mansion behind a tall fence thanks todd said thanks a lot then as regina bent down to pick up the globs of papiermвchй from the garage floor he dropped the worm down the back of her tshirt i cant believe were doing this danny complained my parents said i couldnt come over as soon as they went grocery shopping i ducked out but if they catch me his voice trailed off well be back home in fifteen minutes todd said he shifted gears and pedaled the bike harder dannys old bike splashed through a deep puddle at the curb the rain clouds had rolled away but the wind still gusted cool and damp the sun had set about an hour before now a thin sliver of moon hung low in the evening sky where is the house on glen cove danny asked out of breath todd nodded he shifted gears again he liked shifting back and forth it was a new bike and he still hadnt gotten used to so many gears a car rolled toward them rapidly the glare of its white headlights forcing them to shield their eyes dannys bike rolled up onto the curb and he nearly toppled over whyd they have their brights on he griped beats me todd replied they turned sharply onto glen cove it was a wide street of old houses set back on broad sloping lawns the houses were set far apart separated by dark wooded areas no streetlights danny commented youd think rich people could afford streetlights maybe they like it dark todd replied thoughtfully you know it helps keep people away its kind of creepy here danny said softly leaning over his handlebars dont be a wimp look for todd said sharply thats patricks address wow check out that house danny said slowing down and pointing it looks like a castle i think must be on the next block todd called eagerly pedaling ahead what are we going to say to patrick danny asked breathing hard struggling to catch up im just going to ask him if we can see his worm project todd replied his eyes searching the darkness for address signs maybe ill act like i want to help him out you know give him a few tips on how to take care of the worms nice guy danny teased he chuckled to himself what if patrick says no todd didnt reply he hadnt thought of that he squeezed the hand brake look he pointed to an enormous house behind a tall iron fence thats his house dannys brakes squealed as he brought his bike to a stop he lowered his feet to the wet pavement wow the house rose up over the broad treefilled lawn black against the purple night sky it was completely dark not a light on anywhere no one home danny said whispering good todd replied this is even better maybe we can look down in the basement window or find the window to patricks room and see what hes working on maybe danny replied reluctantly todd glanced around patricks house was the only one on the block and it was surrounded by woods both boys climbed off their bikes and started to walk them to the driveway i cant believe patrick would live in such a wreck of a place todd said pulling off his cap and scratching his hair i mean this house is a real dump maybe his parents are weird or something danny suggested as they parked their bikes maybe todd replied thoughtfully sometimes rich people get a little weird danny said climbing on to the porch and ringing the doorbell how would you know todd said snickering he pulled his cap back down over his dark hair and rang the bell again no answer lets check out the back he said hopping off the porch what for danny demanded lets just look in the windows todd urged moving along to the side of the house lets see if we can see anything at all as they turned the corner it grew even darker the pale sliver of moonlight was reflected in one of the upstairs windows the only light this is dumb danny complained its too dark to see anything inside the house and besides he stopped now whats wrong todd demanded impatiently didnt you hear it i heard it again danny said like a growl some kind of animal growl todd didnt hear the growl but he saw something enormous running toward them he saw the evil red glow of its eyes unblinking eyes trained on him and he knew it was too late to escape run danny screamed but todd couldnt move as the enormous redeyed monster bounded toward them todd pressed his back against a side door he nearly fell as the door swung in the creature uttered an ugly threatening growl its huge paws thundered over the ground inside todd screamed danny get in the house his heart pounding as loudly as the monsters paws todd scrambled into the dark house danny lurched in behind him uttering low gasps todd slammed the door shut as the creature attacked its paws struck the windowpane in the door making the entire door rattle its a dog todd cried in a choked whisper a huge angry dog the dog let out another ferocious growl and leaped at the door its paws scraped over the window a dog danny exclaimed shrilly i thought it was a gorilla the two boys pressed their shoulders against the door holding it shut they peered out warily at the big creature the dog had sat back on its haunches it stared in at them its red eyes glowing it was panting loudly its enormous tongue hanging out of its mouth someone should put that guy on a diet danny exclaimed we could ride that dog to school todd added how do we get out of here danny asked turning away from the dog his eyes searched the dark room hell go away todd said he swallowed hard probably this place is a dump danny said stepping into the room todd turned to follow danny they were in the kitchen he saw pale moonlight floated in through the window even in this dim light todd could see that something was terribly wrong the kitchen counters were bare and covered in dust there were no appliances no toaster no microwave no refrigerator there were no dishes or pots and pans in view glancing down todd saw that the sink was caked with thick dirt weird danny muttered the two boys made their way through a short hallway to the dining room wheres the furniture danny asked gazing in all directions the room was empty maybe theyre redecorating or something todd guessed this doesnt make sense patricks family is rich danny said shaking his head you know how neat patrick is he gets upset if his shirt comes untucked i dont get it todd replied where do you think he has his worm project the two boys made their way toward the living room their sneakers scraped over the dusty bare floor something is weird here danny murmured something is very weird they both gasped as they stepped into the living room and saw the figure hunched at the window saw the decayed green flesh of his face saw the bones of his jaw open in a hideous toothless grin saw his evil sunken eyes staring across the room at them the heavy silence was broken by the shrill screams of the two boys go go todd cried he shoved danny toward the door and stumbled along behind him keeping his hands on dannys shoulders go go go through the bare dining room across the dustcovered kitchen go go todd grabbed the doorknob pulled open the door and they both burst out of the house had the dog left yes lets move todd cried but danny needed no encouragement he was already halfway down the driveway his chubby legs pumping hard his hands stretched out in front of him as if trying to pull himself to safety out the gate onto their bikes they pedaled furiously faster faster until their legs ached and they could barely breathe and they never looked back who was that hideous decayed figure in patricks house and why was the house so dusty so totally bare todd spent most of the night lying awake in his bed thinking about it but the mystery wasnt cleared up until the next morning yawning sleepily todd pulled on the same clothes he had worn the day before then he made his way down the hall to go to breakfast he stopped outside reginas bedroom door when he heard her laughing at first he thought she was talking to herself but then he realized that regina was on the phone so early he pressed his ear to the door and listened isnt it a riot beth regina was saying i sent them to the wrong address regina laughed again gleeful laughter todd suddenly snapped wide awake he pressed his ear tighter against the bedroom door todd was so desperate i couldnt resist regina was saying know where i sent them there was a short pause todd realized he was holding his breath he let it out silently and took another one listening hard i sent them to the old fosgate mansion regina told beth she laughed yeah right that old deserted mansion where those kids had that halloween party yeah you know they left that dummy with the weird mask in the window another pause todd gritted his teeth as he listened to his sisters triumphant laughter he could feel every muscle in his body tightening in anger i dont know beth i havent talked to him yet regina was saying i heard todd come in last night he ran straight to his room and shut the door he was probably too scared to talk more laughter balling and unballing his fists todd stepped away from his sisters door he stopped at the stairs feeling his face grow redhot he was thinking hard so reggie played a little joke on danny and me he thought bitterly so she gave me the wrong address and sent us to that old haunted house haha good joke todd felt so angry he wanted to scream now regina will be laughing at me about this forever he realized she will make fun of me for the rest of my life her bedroom door opened and regina stepped out into the hall she was pulling her brown hair back into a ponytail she stopped when she saw todd at the top of the stairs so how did it go last night she asked him grinning fine he replied casually he gave her an innocent wideeyed stare her grin faded did you go to patricks house did you talk to him about his worm project she demanded staring back at him studying his face todd shook his head no danny and i decided to skip it we just hung out at dannys he lied her dark eyes seemed to dim she bit her lower lip todd could see how disappointed she was he turned and made his way down the stairs feeling a little better you want to play jokes reggie he thought okay fine but now its my turn my turn to play a mean joke todd smiled he had already thought of a really good one todd hoisted the cardboard carton in both hands his worm house was packed carefully inside it was heavier than he thought where shall i put it he asked mrs sanger struggling to keep the heavy carton from slipping out of his hands what i cant hear you the science teacher held a clipboard in one hand she cupped her other hand around her mouth as a megaphone it was deafening in the gym as the kids all hurried to set up their science projects in time for the expo excited voices competed with scraping chairs and tables the rattle of cartons being unpacked and projects of all shapes and sizes being assembled and set up what a crowd todd exclaimed i cant hear you mrs sanger shouted she pointed to a long table against the wall i think your project goes there todd todd started to say something but he was interrupted by the crash of shattering glass and a girls loud scream was that the acid mrs sanger shouted her eyes going wide with horror was that the acid she pushed past todd and went tearing across the gym holding her clipboard in front of her like a shield todd watched a lot of kids gathering around the spot of the accident mrs sanger burst into the circle and everyone began talking at once around the vast gym others ignored the excitement and continued feverishly setting up their projects the bleachers had been pulled down some parents and other kids from the school were already seated waiting to watch the expo and the judging of projects groaning todd started to make his way through the crowded gym carrying the carton he had to stop and chuckle when he caught a glimpse of regina and beth they had their enormous robin set up close to the bleachers the head was the right size now they had managed to shave it down smoothly but some of the tail feathers had gotten mashed and they were working frantically to smooth them out what losers todd thought grinning theres no way theyre going to win the computer turning away he glimpsed dannys balloon solar system hanging on the back wall one of the balloons the one closest to the sun had already deflated pitiful todd thought shaking his head thats just pitiful he sighed poor danny i guess i should have let him share in my project todd lowered the carton onto the table reserved for him ten minutes everyone ten minutes mrs sanger was shouting no problem todd thought he opened the carton and carefully lifted out the worm house what a beauty he thought proudly it looked like a perfect little house todd had polished the wood frame until it glowed and he had cleaned the glass until it was spotless he set the worm house down carefully on the table and turned it so that the glass side faced the audience in the bleachers he gazed into it he could see the long brown and purple worms crawling from room to room he had packed the dirt in carefully then he had dropped in more than twenty worms before sealing it all up its a real big family he thought grinning once the worm house was in place todd pulled out the sign he had made for it and placed the sign beside it on the table he stepped back to admire his work but someone pushed him gently aside make room make room todd it was mrs sanger and to todds surprise she was helping patrick mackay carry a long cardboard carton to the table move your project to the side todd the teacher instructed you have to share the table huh share todd hesitated hurry please mrs sanger pleaded patricks box is heavy im sharing the table with patrick todd couldnt hide his unhappiness obediently he slid his worm house to one side of the table then he stood behind the table watching as patrick and the teacher unloaded the long carton the box was nearly six feet long is that all one worm todd joked very funny patrick muttered he was straining hard to lift his project onto the table this will be our worm table mrs sanger said grabbing the end of the carton and tugging patrick pulled too todd gasped as patrick hoisted his project onto the tabletop very impressive patrick mrs sanger commented straightening her skirt she hurried off to help someone else todd gaped at the project it towered over his it was nearly six feet tall taller than patrick oh nooooo todd moaned to himself he turned to patrick it it isnt it cant be he choked on the words patrick was busily setting up his sign he stepped back checking it out making sure it was straight yes it is he said beaming at todd its a worm skyscraper wow todd didnt want to show how upset he was but he couldnt help it his legs were trembling his mouth dropped open and he started to stutter but but but i dont believe this todd thought miserably i built a crummy little worm house and patrick made a skyscraper its not fair not fair patrick doesnt even like worms he stared at the giant woodandglass structure he could see dozens and dozens of worms inside they were crawling from floor to floor there was even a wooden elevator with several worms tucked inside todd are you okay patrick asked yeah uh fine todd replied trying to force his legs to stop quivering you look a little weird patrick said staring at todd with his bright blue eyes uh thats a nice project patrick todd admitted through clenched teeth you could win the big prize you think so patrick replied as if the thought had never occurred to him thanks todd i got the idea from you about worms i mean you stole the idea you thief todd thought angrily i have only one wish for you patrick go eat worms wow whats that dannys voice broke into todds ugly thoughts he was staring in amazement at patricks project its a worm skyscraper patrick told him beaming with pride danny admired it for a while then he turned to todd why didnt you think of that he whispered todd gave danny a hard shove go blow up a balloon he muttered danny spun around angrily dont shove me mrs sangers voice over the loudspeaker rose over the noise of the gym places by your projects everyone the expo is starting the judges will begin their rounds danny hurried back to his balloon solar system against the wall todd watched him make his way past a display of rocks danny was swinging his arms as he walked and he nearly knocked over all the rocks then todd stepped behind the table he brushed a speck of dust off the roof of his worm house i should just toss it in the trash he thought miserably he glanced at patrick who stood beside him grinning from ear to ear his hands resting on the sides of his magnificent skyscraper the copycat is going to win todd thought sadly he sighed only one thing would cheer him up a little one thing and gazing across the gym todd saw that it was time for it to happen the three judges all teachers from another school were stepping up to check out christopher robin as they bent low to examine the papiermвchй bird feet todd made his way quickly over to his sisters project he wanted a good view one judge a plump young woman in a bright yellow vest examined the tail feathers another judge a man with a shiny bald head was questioning regina and beth the third judge had her back to todd she was running her hand over the birds swelling orange breast reggie and beth look really nervous todd thought edging past a display on how trash gets recycled well they should be nervous what a dumb project todd stopped a few feet in front of the bleachers there was a really big audience for the expo he noticed the bleachers were at least twothirds filled mostly parents and younger brothers and sisters of the contestants the bald judge kept making notes on a small pad as he questioned regina and beth the other two judges were staring up at the giant robins beak todd edged closer whats this string the judge in the yellow vest asked beth huh string beth reacted with surprise she and regina raised their eyes to the yellow beak what string regina demanded too late the judge in the yellow vest pulled the string the beak lowered revealing a surprise inside ohhhh yuck disgusted groans rose up from the audience and regina and beth started to scream fat worms wriggled out from inside the birds beak some of them wriggled out and rained down on the judges a huge purple worm plopped onto the bald judges head the angry judges red face darkened until it nearly matched the purple worm early that morning todd had packed about thirty worms in there he was glad to see that most of them had stayed in the beak people in the bleachers were groaning and moaning thats sick someone yelled gross thats so gross a little boy kept repeating the judges were demanding to know if regina and beth had stuffed the worms up there as a joke mrs sanger was glaring angrily at them the two girls were sputtering their apologies it was a thrilling moment todd thought a thrilling moment about ten or fifteen worms were wriggling across the gym floor todd started to edge back to his table there he is my brother he heard regina shout he glanced up to see her pointing furiously at him todd did it it had to be todd he gave her an innocent shrug i thought christopher robin looked hungry so i fed him he called then he hurried back to his worm house a big grin on his handsome face patrick slapped todd a high five cool move ace todd grudgingly accepted the congratulations he didnt want to be friends with patrick he wanted patrick to go eat worms he glanced back at danny danny was frantically blowing up a balloon the rings had fallen off saturn and someone had accidentally popped pluto todd smiled he felt pretty good his little joke had worked perfectly revenge was sweet he had paid regina back for sending him to that creepy old house but his smile faded as he glanced at patricks skyscraper and remembered that he was going to miss out on the grand prize it took the school janitor a few minutes to round up all the worms the crowd in the bleachers cheered him on as he scooped up the wiggling worms one by one and dropped them into an empty coffee can after that the expo continued calmly and quietly the judges moved from project to project asking questions making notes todd took a deep breath when they approached his table dont get excited he warned himself the worm house looks really puny next to the worm skyscraper he had a sudden urge to bump the table to shake it really hard maybe the skyscraper would topple over and the house would be left standing i could pretend it was just an accident todd thought evil thoughts but he didnt do it the three judges spent about ten seconds looking at todds project they didnt ask todd a single question then they gazed at patricks skyscraper for at least five minutes how did you get all those worms in there the bald judge asked i love the elevator how many worms are there in total can worms survive in a real skyscraper and what does this project prove about gravity yak yak yak todd thought bitterly he watched the judges coo and carry on over patricks project he wanted to grab all three of them and say hes a copycat im the real worm guy im the one who likes worms but he just stood there grinding his teeth tapping his fingers tensely on the tabletop still scribbling notes about patricks project the judges moved on to the next project liquids and gases patrick turned to todd and forced him into slapping another high five you can come over and see my new computer anytime patrick whispered confidently todd forced a weak laugh he turned away from patrick and found his sister glaring at him furiously from the other side of the table how could you todd she demanded spitting out the words her hands pressed tightly at her waist how could you do that to beth and me easy he replied unable to keep a grin off his face you ruined our project regina cried i know todd said still grinning you deserved it regina started to sputter the loudspeaker above their heads crackled on ladies and gentlemen we have a winner mrs sanger declared the huge gym grew silent no one moved the judges have a winner mrs sanger repeated her voice booming off the tile walls the grandprize winner of this years science expo is the winner is mrs sanger announced danny fletcher and his balloon solar system the audience in the bleachers was quiet for a moment but then erupted in cheers and applause todds classmates on the floor applauded too todd turned and caught the startled expression on dannys face several kids rushed forward to congratulate danny the balloons bobbed behind danny as he grinned and took a funny bow the gym erupted as everyone began to talk at once then the spectators made their way down from the bleachers and began wandering through the displays i dont believe this todd thought glancing at patrick he saw that patrick felt the same way danny flashed todd a thumbsup sign todd returned it shaking his head he felt a hard shove on his shoulders hey he cried out angrily and spun around are you still here regina glared at him angrily thats for ruining our project she shouted she shoved him again you apologize she demanded furiously he laughed no way she growled at him and raised her fists go eat worms she screamed still laughing he pulled off the wooden back of his worm house and lifted up a long brown worm he dangled it in front of his sisters face here have some dessert with a furious cry regina completely lost all control she leaped at todd shoving him over backwards he cried out as he sprawled back and hit the table hard several kids let out startled screams as the enormous worm skyscraper tilted tilted tilted no patrick screamed he reached out both hands to stop it and missed and the heavy woodandglass structure toppled onto the next table with a deafening crash of shattered glass no a girl screamed thats liquids and gases look out its liquids and gases dirt poured out of the broken skyscraper several worms came wriggling out onto the table as todd pulled himself to his feet wild screams filled the gym liquids and gases whats that smoke what did they break did they break a window liquids and gases thick white smoke poured up from a broken glass bottle under the fallen skyscraper everybody out someone yelled everybody out its going to blow up no one was hurt in the explosion some strange gases escaped and it smelled pretty weird in the gym for a while a lot of worms went flying across the room and there was a lot of broken glass to be cleaned up but it was a minor explosion todd told his parents later really no big deal he said im sure everyone will forget all about it in five or ten years a few days later carrying a small white carton in both hands todd made his way down the basement stairs he could hear the steady plonk plonk of pingpong balls against paddles regina and beth glanced up from their game as he entered the room chinese food beth asked spotting the little box no worms todd replied crossing the room to his worm tank are you still into worms beth demanded twirling her pingpong paddle even after what happened at the science expo it all got cleaned up todd snapped it was no big deal hah regina cried scornfully todd gazed at his sister in surprise hey are you talking to me again regina was so furious she hadnt said a word to him since the big disaster no i am not talking to you regina replied with a sneer i will never talk to you again give me a break todd muttered he opened the carton and poured the new worms into the big glass aquarium where he stored his collection plonk plonk the girls returned to their game you know what happened at the science expo was no tragedy todd called to them some people thought it was kind of funny he snickered some people are kind of sick beth muttered regina slammed the ball hard it sailed into the net you ruined everything she accused todd angrily you ruined the whole expo and you ruined our project beth added reaching for the ball you made us look like total jerks so todd replied laughing the girls didnt laugh i only did it because you sent danny and me to that creepy old house todd told them he used a small trowel to soften the dirt in the worm tank well you wouldnt have won anyway regina said sneering patricks skyscraper made your puny house look like a babys project youre jealous of patrick arent you todd beth accused him jealous of that copycat todd cried he doesnt know one end of a worm from another the girls started their game again beth took a wild swing and sent the ball sailing across the room todd caught it with his free hand come here he said ill show you something cool no way regina replied nastily just toss back the ball beth said holding up her hand to catch it come here this is really cool todd insisted grinning he pulled a long worm out of the tank and held it up in the air it wriggled and squirmed trying to get free regina and beth didnt move away from the table but he saw that they were watching him todd set the long worm down on the table and picked up a pocket knife you watching with one quick motion he sliced the worm in half yuck beth cried making a disgusted face youre sick regina declared youre really sick todd watch todd instructed all three of them stared at the tabletop as the two worm halves wriggled off in different directions see todd cried laughing now there are two of them sick really sick his sister muttered thats really gross todd beth agreed shaking her head but wouldnt it be cool if people could do that todd exclaimed you know your bottom half goes to school and your top half stays home and watches tv hey look at that regina cried suddenly she pointed to the glass worm tank huh what todd demanded lowering his eyes to the worms those worms they were watching you regina exclaimed see theyre sort of staring at you get serious todd muttered but he saw that regina was right three of the worms had their heads raised out of the dirt and seemed to be staring up at him you have a weird imagination todd insisted no they were watching regina insisted excitedly i saw them watching you when you cut that worm in two worms cant see todd told them they werent watching me thats stupid thats but they were regina cried the worms are angry beth added glancing at regina the worms dont like to see their friend cut in half stop todd pleaded just give me a break okay the worms are going to get revenge todd regina said they saw what you did now theyre planning their revenge todd let out a scornful laugh you must think im as stupid as you are he declared theres no way im going to fall for that no way im going to believe such a stupid idea giggling to each other regina and beth returned to their pingpong game todd dropped the two worm halves into the tank to his surprise four more worms had poked up out of the soft dirt they were staring straight up at him todd stared down at them thinking about what regina and beth had said what a stupid idea he thought those worms werent watching me or were they todd rise and shine todd blinked his eyes open he sat up slowly in bed and stretched his arms over his head rise and shine todd look alive his mother called from the foot of the stairs why does she say the same thing every morning he wondered always rise and shine rise and shine why cant she say time to get up or move em on out or something just for a little variety grumpily he pulled himself up and lowered his feet to the floor why cant i have a clock radio like regina he asked himself then i could wake up to music instead of rise and shine look alive up there mrs barstow called impatiently im up im up mom todd shouted hoarsely down to her bright sunlight poured in through the bedroom window squinting toward the window he could see a patch of clear blue sky nice day he thought what day is it he asked himself standing up and stretching some more thursday yeah thursday good he thought we have gym on thursday maybe well play softball gym was todds favorite class especially on days they went outside his pajama bottoms had become totally twisted he straightened them as he made his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth are we having the math quiz today or tomorrow he wondered squinting at his sleepy face in the medicine chest mirror i hope its tomorrow i forgot to study for it last night he stuck his tongue out at himself he could hear regina downstairs arguing about something with their mother regina liked to argue in the morning it was the way she got her mind into gear she argued about what to wear or what she wanted for breakfast one of her favorite arguments was whether or not it was too warm to wear a jacket todds mother never learned she always argued back so they had pretty noisy mornings todd liked to sleep as long as possible then he took his time getting dressed that way regina was usually all finished with her arguing by the time he came downstairs thinking about the math quiz he brushed his teeth then he returned to his room and pulled on a clean pair of faded jeans and a navy blue tshirt that came down nearly to his knees regina and mrs barstow were still arguing as todd entered the kitchen regina her dark hair tied back in a single braid sat at the table finishing her breakfast their mother dressed for work stood on the other side of the table a steaming cup of coffee in one hand but im too hot in that jacket regina was insisting then why not wear a sweatshirt their mother suggested patiently i dont have any regina complained you have a whole drawerful mrs barstow protested but i dont like those regina cried shrilly todd grabbed his glass of orange juice off the table and gulped it down in one long swallow todd sit down and have your breakfast his mother ordered cant im late he said wiping orange juice off his upper lip with one hand got to go but you havent brushed your hair mrs barstow exclaimed regina chewing on a piece of rye toast laughed how can you tell todd ignored her no need he told his mother im wearing my raiders cap he glanced toward the hook on the hallway wall where he thought he had left it not there i cant believe the school lets you wear your cap all day mrs barstow murmured refilling her coffee cup they dont care todd told her only the real grunges wear caps regina reported is your brother a grunge their mother asked raising her eyes over the white mug as she sipped coffee has anyone seen my raiders cap todd asked quickly before regina could answer isnt it on the hook mrs barstow asked glancing toward the hall todd shook his head maybe i left it upstairs he turned and hurried toward the front stairs come back and eat your cereal its getting soggy his mother called grabbing on to the banister todd took the stairs two at a time standing in the doorway to his room his eyes searched the bed the dressertop no cap he was halfway to the closet when he spotted it on the floor i must have tossed it there before bed he remembered bending down he picked up the cap and slid it down over his hair he knew at once that something was wrong something felt funny as he bent the bill down the way he liked it he felt something move in his hair something wet it felt as if his hair had come to life and had started to crawl around under the cap moving quickly to the mirror over the dresser todd pulled the cap away and stared in shock at the fat brown worms wriggling through his hair todd shook his head hard a shudder of surprise one of the worms toppled from his hair and slid down his forehead dropping onto the dressertop i dont believe this todd muttered out loud he tossed the cap to the floor then he reached up with both hands and carefully began untangling the worms from his hair regina he screamed regina youre going to pay for this he pulled three worms off his head then picked up the fourth from the dresser yuck he made a disgusted face into the mirror his hair was damp and sticky where the worms had crawled okay reggie im coming he shouted as he barreled down the stairs the worms dangling in one fist she glanced up casually from the table as todd burst into the kitchen your cereal is really getting soggy his mother said from the sink youd better she stopped when she saw the worms in todds hand very funny regina todd exclaimed angrily he shoved the fistful of worms under his sisters nose yuck get away she shrieked todd get those worms away from the table mrs barstow demanded sharply whats wrong with you you know better than that dont yell at me todd screeched at his mother yell at her he pointed furiously at his sister me reginas eyes opened wide in innocence what did i do todd let out an angry groan and turned to face his mother she stuffed worms in my cap he exclaimed shaking the worms in mrs barstows face huh regina cried furiously thats a lie todd and regina began screaming accusations at each other mrs barstow stepped between them quiet please she demanded please but but todd sputtered todd youre going to squeeze those poor worms to death mrs barstow declared go put them away in the basement then take a deep breath count to ten and come back todd grumbled under his breath but he obediently headed down to the basement when he returned to the kitchen a minute later regina was still denying that she had loaded the cap with worms she turned to todd a solemn expression on her face i swear todd she said it wasnt me yeah sure todd muttered then who else did it dad do you think dad filled my cap with worms before he went to work the idea was so ridiculous it made all three of them laugh mrs barstow put her hands on todds shoulders and guided him into his seat at the table cereal she said softly eat your cereal youre going to be late leave my worms alone todd told his sister in a low voice he pulled the chair in and picked up the spoon i mean it reggie i hate your stupid jokes and i dont like people messing with my worms regina sighed wearily i dont mess with your disgusting worms she shot back i told you i didnt do it lets just drop it okay mrs barstow pleaded look at the clock guys but why should she get away with that mom todd demanded why should she be allowed to because i didnt do it regina interrupted you had to do it todd screamed i think you did it yourself regina suggested with a sneer i think you stuffed worms in your own cap oh thats good thats good todd cried sarcastically why regina why would i do that to get me in trouble regina replied todd gaped at her speechless youre both going to be in trouble if you dont drop this discussion right now their mother insisted okay well drop it todd grumbled glaring at his sister he dipped the spoon into the cereal totally soggy he muttered how am i supposed to reginas shrill scream cut off todds complaint he followed her horrified gaze down to his bowl where he found a fat purple worm floating on top of the milk todd tried to concentrate in school but he kept thinking about the worms of course it had to be regina who had put the worms in his cap and in his cereal bowl but she had acted so shocked and she said again and again that she didnt know anything about them todd kept thinking about the afternoon in the basement about cutting the worm in half about the other worms watching him from their glass tank they saw what you did his sister had said in a low frightened voice and now theyre planning their revenge thats so stupid todd thought pretending to read his social studies text so stupid but thinking about reginas words gave him a chill and thinking about the worms waiting in his cap crawling so wetly through his hair made todd feel a little sick he told danny all about it at lunch they sat across from each other in the noisy lunchroom danny unpacked his lunch from the brown paper lunch bag and examined the sandwich ham and cheese again he groaned every day mom gives me ham and cheese why dont you ask for something else todd suggested i dont like anything else danny replied tearing open his bag of potato chips todd unpacked his lunch too but he left it untouched as he told danny about the worms danny laughed at first your sister is really a jerk he said through a mouthful of potato chips i guess youre right todd replied thoughtfully its got to be regina but she acted so surprised i mean she screamed when she saw the worm floating in the cereal she probably practiced screaming all day yesterday danny said chomping into his sandwich todd unwrapped the tinfoil from his sandwich peanut butter and jelly yeah maybe he said frowning come on todd danny said mustard dripping down his chin that worm tank of yours is really deep the worms didnt crawl out all by themselves and they didnt crawl upstairs to your room and then find your hat and crawl inside youre right youre right todd said still frowning thoughtfully he pushed back his raiders cap and scratched his brown hair but i just keep seeing those worms staring up at me and worms dont have eyes danny declared and they dont have faces and mainly they dont have brains todd laughed danny was completely right he realized the idea of worms planning to get their revenge was just dumb feeling a lot better he slid down in the chair and started his lunch lets talk about something else he said taking a long drink from his box of juice he raised his peanut butterandjelly sandwich to his mouth and took a big bite did you see dawkins fall off his chair this morning danny asked snickering todd grinned yeah miss grant jumped so high her head nearly hit the ceiling i thought she was going to drop her teeth luckily dawkins landed on his head danny exclaimed wiping the mustard off his chin with the back of one hand dawkins cant stay on a chair no balance or something every day he danny stopped when he saw the sick expression on todds face hey todd whats your problem ththis peanut butter sandwich todd stammered it tastes kind of strange huh danny lowered his eyes to the halfeaten sandwich in todds hand reluctantly todd pulled apart the two slices of bread both boys moaned in disgust and let out hoarse gagging sounds as they saw the halfeaten purple worm curled up in the peanut butter have you seen my sister todd asked a group of kids at the door that led out to the playground they all shook their heads no after angrily tossing away his lunch todd had run out of the lunchroom in search of regina he had to let her know that her dumb joke had gone too far putting a worm in his peanut butter wasnt the least bit funny it was sick as he ran through the halls searching in each room for her todd could still taste the faintly sour flavor of the worm could still feel its soft squishy body between his teeth it made his teeth itch it made him feel itchy all over regina youre not getting away with this he thought bitterly by the time he reached the end of the hallway he felt so angry he was seeing red he pushed past the group of kids opened the door and burst outside the bright afternoon sunlight made him lower his cap to shield his eyes he searched the playground for his sister some kids from his class were playing a loud frantic kickball game on the softball diamond jerry dawkins and a few other guys called to todd to join the game but he waved them off and kept running he was in no mood for games regina where are you he circled the entire playground and teacher parking lot before he gave up then he slowly unhappily trudged back toward the school building his stomach growled and churned he could picture the worm half wriggling around inside him all around kids were yelling and laughing and having fun they didnt eat worms for lunch todd thought bitterly they dont have a mean vicious sister who tries to ruin their lives he was nearly to the door walking slowly his head bowed when he spotted regina standing in the shade at the corner of the building he stopped and watched her she was talking to someone then she started to laugh keeping against the redbrick wall todd edged a little closer he could see two others in the shade with regina beth and patrick all three of them were laughing now what was so funny todd could feel the rage boiling up in him as he crept closer trying to hear what they were saying he balled his hands into tight angry fists pressing against the building todd stopped and listened regina said something he couldnt make out the words he took a step closer then one more and he heard beth laugh and say so todd doesnt know youre doing it and then patrick replied no todd doesnt know he doesnt know im doing it stunned todd jammed his back against the brick wall patrick how can patrick be doing it todd wondered thats impossible unless todd couldnt hold back any longer he angrily stepped forward feeling his face grow redhot the three of them turned in surprise so youre doing it todd cried to patrick youre giving my sister the worms huh worms patricks mouth dropped open he held a large sheet of construction paper in his hand todd saw him slip the sheet of paper behind his back yeah worms todd repeated snarling the words i heard what you said patrick patrick isnt giving me worms regina broke in what is your problem todd why would i want worms thats where youre getting them todd insisted i heard you i heard the whole thing the three of them exchanged bewildered glances im not into worms anymore patrick said i tossed all my worms into my dads garden liar todd accused in a low voice no its true i helped him beth said i got bored with them i dont collect them anymore patrick told him im into comic strips now huh comic strips todd stared suspiciously at patrick the two girls began to grin yeah im drawing comic strips patrick said im a pretty good artist hes just trying to confuse me todd thought angrily patrick give me a break todd muttered youre a really bad liar i heard what you were saying and with a quick move todd reached out and grabbed the sheet of paper from behind patricks back hey give that back patrick reached for it but todd swung it out of his reach huh its a comic strip todd exclaimed he raised it closer to his face and started to read it the adventures of todd the worm that was the title in big block superherotype letters and in the first panel there stood a smiling worm with wavy brown hair wearing a silverandblack raiders cap todd the worm todd cried weakly staring at the comic strip in disbelief the three of them burst out laughing thats what we were laughing about regina told him shaking her head patrick can draw pretty well cant he todd didnt reply he scowled at the comic strip todd the worm a worm in a raiders cap patrick thinks hes so funny todd thought bitterly haha remind me to laugh sometime he murmured sarcastically he handed the sheet of paper back to patrick the bell on the side of the building rang loudly above their heads todd covered his ears everyone on the playground started running to the door beth and regina jogged ahead of todd so what about the worm in my sandwich he called to his sister hurrying to catch up he grabbed her by the shoulder and spun her around what about the worm todd let go she spun out of his grasp what worm are you still carrying on about breakfast no lunch todd shouted furiously you know what im talking about reggie dont pretend she shook her head no i really dont todd she turned to the door were going to be late you put the worm in my sandwich he screamed his eyes locked on hers she made a disgusted face yuck in your sandwich she seemed really shocked thats gross regina you didnt eat it did you she asked covering her mouth in horror uh no no way todd lied ugh im going to be sick regina cried she turned and still covering her mouth ran into the building todd stared after her she seemed totally shocked he realized is it possible that regina didnt do it is it possible but then if regina didnt do it what does that mean arent you sick of worms why are we digging up more worms danny demanded todd dug his shovel into the soft mud behind second base i need more he murmured he pulled up a long brown one it wriggled between his fingers move the bucket over danny danny obediently held the bucket closer todd dropped the worm into it and bent to dig up more my worms are all disappearing he said softly concentrating on his work theyre escaping i guess so i need more but they cant escape danny insisted todd dropped a short fat one into the bucket they both heard the rumbling sound at the same time the ground behind second base trembled dannys eyes grew wide with fright todd another earthquake todd tilted his head as he listened he dropped the shovel and placed both hands flat on the ground it its shaking a little he reported weve got to go danny cried climbing to his feet weve got to tell someone nobody ever believes us todd replied not moving from the ground and look the rest of the playground doesnt seem to be shaking at all the mud made a soft cracking sound as it trembled todd jumped to his feet and grabbed up the bucket maybe we should find another place to get worms danny suggested backing away from the spot his eyes on the shaking ground but this is the best spot todd replied maybe its a sinkhole danny declared as they hurried off the playground did you see that sinkhole on the news a big hole just opened up in somebodys back yard and it grew bigger and bigger and people fell in it and were swallowed up stop trying to scare me todd told his friend ive got enough problems without worrying about sinkholes when he arrived at school on friday morning todd found three worms wriggling around in his backpack he calmly carried them out to the front of the school and deposited them in the dirt under the long hedge that lined the building im going to stay calm he decided theyre only worms after all and i like worms i collect worms im a worm expert he returned to the building frowning fretfully if im such an expert he asked himself why cant i explain how the worms are following me everywhere when he took out his math notebook an hour later he found a mass of long purple worms crawling around near the binding and between the pages the kids sitting near him saw them and started pointing and screaming todd mr hargrove the math teacher said sternly i think we saw enough of your worms at the science expo i know youre attached to them but do you have to bring them to math class everyone laughed todd could feel his face growing hot todds saving them for lunch danny exclaimed from two rows behind him everyone laughed even louder thanks a bunch danny todd thought angrily he scooped the worms up carried them to the window and lowered them to the ground later in the lunchroom todd unwrapped his sandwich carefully peanut butter and jelly again danny leaned across the table staring hard at the sandwich go ahead open it he murmured todd hesitated gripping the sandwich in both hands how many worms would be crawling through the peanut butter this time two three ten go ahead danny urged what are you waiting for todd took a deep breath and held it then he slowly pulled apart the two slices of bread no worm todd declared both boys let out long sighs of relief danny sank back into his seat and picked up what was left of his ham sandwich todd didnt eat he stared thoughtfully at the peanut butter covered with smears of grape jelly theyre going to drive me totally crazy he muttered what danny asked with a mouthful of sandwich nothing todd replied his head itched he pulled off his cap and reached up to scratch it he expected to find a worm in his hair but there wasnt one every time he opened his bookbag he expected to find worms every time he ate a meal he expected to see a worm bobbing or wriggling or crawling or swimming through his food he was starting to imagine worms everywhere everywhere todd had dinner at dannys that night dannys mother served fried chicken and mashed potatoes then she and dannys father argued all through dinner about where to go on their vacation and whether or not they should save the money and buy a couch instead danny seemed really embarrassed about his parents loud arguing but todd didnt mind it at all he was so happy to relax and eat and not worry about finding any long purple worms on his plate or in his glass he and danny went up to dannys room and played video games for a few hours after dinner danny had a game called worm attack todd made him bury it deep in the closet dannys father drove todd home at about ten todds parents were already dressed for bed your mom and i both had rough days mr barstow explained were hitting the sack early you can stay up and watch tv or something if you want todd todd didnt feel sleepy so he went into the den and turned on the tv he watched a star trek that hed already seen he was yawning and feeling tired by the time the show went off at eleven he turned off all the lights and made his way up to his room he realized he was feeling really good really relaxed i havent thought about worms all night he told himself happily he climbed out of his clothes tossing them onto the floor and pulled on his pajamas a warm soft wind was fluttering the curtains at the window he could see a pale halfmoon in the black nighttime sky clicking off the bed table lamp todd pulled back his covers and slipped into bed he yawned loudly and shut his eyes tomorrow is saturday he thought happily no school he turned onto his stomach and buried his face in the pillow he felt something wet and warm wriggle against his cheek then he felt something moving under his chest oh he jerked himself upright pulling himself up with both hands a long wet worm clung to the side of his face he reached up and pulled it off he jumped out of bed it took a short while to find the bed table lamp in the darkness finally he managed to click it on blinking in the light he saw a worm stuck to the front of his pajama shirt three long brown worms were crawling on his sheet two more were stretched out on the pillow no no stop it took todd a while to realize that the shrill screams were coming from him i cant take it anymore he shrieked losing control he pulled the worm off his pajama shirt and tossed it onto the bed beside the others regina regina youve got to stop it youve got to todd screamed he spun around when he heard footsteps at the bedroom door mom todd wailed mom look he pointed frantically to the worms crawling on his pillow and bedsheet mrs barstow raised both hands to her cheeks in surprise mom youve got to stop regina todd pleaded youve got to stop her look what she did look what she put in my bed mrs barstow moved quickly into the room and put an arm around todds trembling shoulders but regina isnt here todd she said gently huh he gaped at her in shock regina is at a sleepover at beths his mother explained regina isnt here well have to have a long discussion about this in the morning mrs barstow said her arm still around todds shoulders maybe your worms are escaping from the tank somehow maybe todd replied doubtfully his mother lowered her eyes to the bed yuck take the worms back downstairs todd and ill change the sheets todd obediently lifted the worms off the sheet and pillowcase two of them were mashed but the rest were wriggling and squirming theyre taking their revenge todd thought with a shudder as he carried them out of the room regina was right the worms are paying me back the worms dangled from his hand as he carried them down to the basement he dropped them into the tank then he leaned over it staring down into the soft wet dirt most of the worms were below the surface but a few crawled across the top hey guys todd called down to them lowering his face over the top of the glass aquarium hey guys can you hear me he had never talked to his worms before and he felt very uncomfortable talking to them now but he was desperate listen guys im really sorry todd said speaking softly he didnt want his voice to carry upstairs if his mom or dad heard him talking to the worms theyd know he was totally looney tunes im really sorry about what happened he told them i mean about cutting that one in half it will never happen again i promise leaning over the tank he stared down into the dirt the worms didnt seem to be paying any attention to him two of them were crawling against one of the glass walls another was burrowing into the dirt so do you think you can stop following me around todd continued giving it one last try i mean i dont want to get rid of you all ive been collecting worms for a long time but if you keep this up well youll all have to go todd lifted his head out and stood up straight i cant believe i just did that he thought maybe i am totally nuts he glanced quickly around the basement expecting regina and his parents to pop out from behind the furnace crying april fool but no one else was down there luckily no one had seen him actually pleading with the worms feeling really foolish and confused todd trudged back up to his room his mother was waiting for him in the hall outside his room what took so long nothing todd muttered feeling himself blush she swept a hand through his wavy dark hair i never get to see your hair she said smiling its always under that awful cap yeah i know todd yawned go change your pajamas she instructed him those have worm juice all over them ill run you a hot bath no no bath todd said sharply im too tired you dont want a bath after rolling around on worms mrs barstow demanded tomorrow okay he pleaded okay she agreed but change your pajamas good night todd watched her make her way downstairs then he returned to his room and changed into clean pajamas he inspected the bed carefully even though the sheets were new then he examined the pillow when he was certain there were no worms he turned off the light and slipped into bed lying on his back he stared out the window at the pale halfmoon and thought about the worms regina was sleeping over at beths but the bed was full of worms how how were they wriggling into his backpack into his notebooks into his breakfast his lunch the room began to whirl todd felt dizzy so sleepy so very sleepy but he couldnt stop puzzling about the worms such a mystery the night sky grew darker the moon rose away from the window its so late todd thought and i cant get to sleep maybe i do need a hot bath he told himself lowering his feet to the floor baths always relaxed him he crept silently out of his room and down the hall to the bathroom he didnt want to wake his parents closing the bathroom door behind him he clicked on the light then he turned on the water and filled the tub making it nice and hot when the water was nearly to the top he pulled off his pajamas then he lowered himself into the steamy water mmmmmm he hummed aloud as he settled into it the hot water felt so good so soothing this was a good idea he told himself resting his head against the back of the tub he smiled and shut his eyes just what i needed a soft splash made todd open his eyes and glance at the faucet had he forgotten to turn it off another splash ohh todd let out a soft moan as a fat purple worm slid out of the faucet and hit the water oh no splash another worm dropped from the faucet then two more they hit the surface of the water and plunged to the tub bottom just past todds feet hey he pulled his feet away and drew himself up to a sitting position whats going on as todd stared in horror brown and purple worms tumbled from the faucet three and four at a time splashing into the tub he raised his eyes to see more worms sliding down the tile wall plopping onto the water onto his legs onto his shoulders no he struggled to climb out trying to push himself to his feet with both hands but the tub bottom was covered with wriggling swimming slithering worms and his hands kept slipping out from under him help breathing hard he managed to climb to his knees worms clung to his back his shoulders he could feel them crawling over his hot wet skin more worms tumbled down the wall they seemed to be raining from the ceiling more and more poured out of the faucet they had turned the entire tub into a seething wriggling sea of brown and purple help somebody todd shouted but the worms were pulling him now pulling him down he could feel their wet grasp hundreds of tiny prickles as they held him tightly and tugged him down down into the churning water they plopped onto his head crawled over his face dangled from his quivering shoulders covered him covered him and continued to rain down to pour down and pull him down with them into the wriggling dark sea of warm wet worms please help me todd struggled and squirmed he twisted his body trying to swing his arms free but the worms held on forcing him down pulling him into the slimy brown water and more worms rained down curling and uncurling as they slid down the wall dropped from the ceiling and poured from the faucet oh he let out a startled cry as he tugged himself back to a sitting position he thrashed his arms hard sending a spray of water over the side of the tub he blinked once twice and the worms disappeared all of them huh his mouth dropped open as he gazed into the tub the ceiling light reflected in the clear water hesitantly he moved his toes he splashed the water with both feet clear perfectly clear and clean wow todd murmured shaking his head wow the wriggling tumbling worms lingered in his mind despite the heat of the bathwater a cold shiver ran down his body he climbed quickly out of the tub and wrapped a large green bath towel around himself a dream it had all been a disgusting dream he had fallen asleep in the bathtub and had dreamed up all of the worms he shivered again he still felt shaky he could still feel the itchy pinpricks all over his body drying himself quickly he let the towel slip to the floor and pulled on his pajamas then as he hurried back to his room eager to climb under the covers he had an idea he had an idea about how to solve the worm mystery it was so simple he realized such a simple plan but it would tell him once and for all how the worms were escaping from their tank and getting into his things yes he cried in an excited whisper yes finally he had a plan he knew exactly what to do it will have to wait till sunday night he told himself climbing into bed and pulling up the blankets but ill be ready then ready for anything thinking about his plan todd fell asleep with a smile on his face the weekend passed slowly todd and danny went to a movie on saturday it was a comedy about space aliens trying to run a car wash the aliens kept getting confused and washing themselves instead of the cars in the end they blew up the whole planet danny thought it was very funny todd thought it was dumb but funny on sunday regina came home from beths the whole family drove upstate to visit some cousins it was a noworms weekend todd told danny over the phone after dinner on sunday evening way to go danny replied enthusiastically not a single worm todd told him twisting the phone cord around his wrist so are you going ahead with your plan danny demanded yeah sure todd said i have to they just took the weekend off for sure tomorrow is school that means more worms in my backpack in my books in my lunch yuck danny murmured on the other end of the line ive got to solve the mystery todd told him ive got to well good luck danny said ill meet you tomorrow morning outside of miss grants class okay get there early so you can tell me how it went okay todd replied see you tomorrow as he hung up the phone he felt excited and nervous and eager and frightened all at the same time he tried playing a nintendo football game to pass the time but he was so excited and nervous he kept using the wrong fingers on the controller and the machine beat him easily then he paced back and forth in his room watching the clock slowly slide from number to number at tenthirty he and regina said good night to their parents and returned to their rooms todd changed into his pajamas turned out the lights then sat on the edge of his bed waiting waiting for his parents to go to bed he heard their door close at elevenfifteen then he waited another fifteen minutes sitting tensely in the dark listening to the soft creaks and groans of the house listening to the heavy silence a little after eleventhirty todd climbed out of his bed and tiptoed silently out of his room its time he told himself creeping down the dark hall to the stairs time to get to the bottom of this time to solve the mystery of the worms the basement stairs creaked loudly under todds bare feet but there was nothing he could do about that he tried to move as silently as a mouse he didnt want to alert anyone in his family that he was awake he grabbed the wall and caught his balance as he started to stumble on the basement steps taking a deep breath he stopped and listened had anyone heard him silence the wooden steps were steep and rickety but todd couldnt turn on the lights he didnt want anyone to see him not even the worms a pale square of light spread across the basement floor moonlight pouring through the narrow window up near the basement ceiling todd stepped around the light keeping in the dark shadows his heart pounded as he made his way slowly carefully across the room ow he let out a whispered cry as he banged his waist into the corner of the pingpong table he quickly covered his mouth before he could cry out again the pain slowly faded rubbing his side todd picked up a tall stool and carried it over to one of the concrete beams that rose from floor to ceiling he set the stool down slowly carefully gazing around the beam he could see the worm tank on its table the glass tank reflected the glow of the moonlight that invaded the dark basement todd lifted himself silently onto the stool hidden behind the square concrete beam he could watch the worms but they couldnt see him he gripped his hands around the beam and steadied himself on the tall stool glancing up he saw the high window filled with moonlight glow like silver the light cast eerie shadows over the entire basement todd forced his breathing to slow to normal got to take it easy it may be a long wait he told himself i may be sitting here watching the worm tank all night what did he expect to see he wasnt sure but he knew something would happen something would happen to explain the mystery of the worms to him leaning against the beam todd stared at the glass aquarium tank were the worms plotting and planning inside were they deciding which ones of them would crawl upstairs and climb into todds things todd suddenly imagined a different story glancing back at the silvery basement window he imagined it opening he imagined a dark figure sliding into the basement patrick he imagined patrick lowering himself onto the basement floor then crossing the room to the worm tank he imagined patrick pulling up worms from the tank and sneaking upstairs with them todd could see patrick grinning as he dropped the worms into todds backpack slipped one into the cornflakes box hid one in todds sneaker its possible todd told himself turning his attention back to the worms it isnt a totally crazy idea it isnt as crazy an idea as a bunch of worms planning their revenge he yawned covering his mouth so the worms wouldnt hear how long will i have to sit here he wondered he felt a chill at the back of his neck it was creepy down here in the dark what were those soft skittering sounds mice he didnt have long to think about them a loud creak behind him made todd gasp he gripped the concrete beam the stairs began to groan he heard the slow thud of footsteps footsteps growing louder moving down the stairs todd lowered his feet to the floor he pressed himself tightly behind the beam trying to hide the stairs creaked and groaned the thud of footsteps stopped at the bottom of the steps todd squinted hard into the darkness who was it who was sneaking down to the basement who was sneaking down to the worm tank who todd gasped as the ceiling lights flickered on it took a second or two for his eyes to adjust to the bright fluorescent light then he saw the figure standing at the light switch dad todd cried mr barstow jumped in surprise he had a yellow bathrobe slung loosely around him he carried one of todds baseball bats in both hands raised waist high dad what are you doing down here todd cried shrilly todds father lowered the baseball bat his mouth dropped open as he squinted across the room at todd what are you doing down here he demanded im uh watching the worms todd confessed mr barstow let the bat drop to the floor it clanked noisily at his feet he made his way quickly over to todd carefully stepping around the pingpong table i heard the basement steps creaking he told todd i heard a crash down here someone banging into the pingpong table i i thought it was a burglar so i grabbed the bat and came down to investigate its just me dad todd said i had to find out how my worms are getting into my stuff so i decided to watch them all night and see if ive had it with those worms mr barstow exclaimed angrily but dad todd protested whats going on down there are you okay mrs barstow called from the top of the stairs everything is okay dear todds father called its just more worm trouble those disgusting worms again come up here and get back to bed mrs barstow ordered todd could hear her padding back to her room those worms are out of here tomorrow mr barstow said sternly tightening the belt of the yellow robe what todd cried dad please enough is enough todd i dont understand whats been going on with your worms his father said frowning resting his hands on his waist but i cant have you scaring everyone in the house sneaking around in the middle of the night sitting in the dark staring at a tank of worms instead of getting your sleep but but todd sputtered mr barstow shook his head my mind is made up no discussion the worms go tomorrow afternoon take them outside and dump them all in the garden but dad mr barstow raised a hand for silence i mean it in the garden tomorrow afternoon im sure you can find something better to collect than worms he placed both hands on todds shoulders and marched him toward the stairs todd sighed unhappily but didnt say any more he knew better than to argue with his father when his dad made up his mind about something he could be very stubborn todd climbed the rest of the way to his room in silence feeling angry and disappointed as he dropped onto his bed and jerked up the covers he grumbled to himself about the most disappointing thing of all he hadnt solved the mystery all that planning all that sneaking around hed had such high hopes for getting to the bottom of it once and for all but no not only was he about to lose all of his worms but now he would never know how the worms got into his things i dont care about those stupid worms he told himself i dont care that i have to throw them all away all i really care about is solving the mystery angry and frustrated todd turned and started to punch his pillow hard with both fists again again he didnt realize that the whole mystery would be solved accidentally just a few hours later it rained the next morning todd didnt even notice as he walked slowly to school his thoughts were darker than the storm clouds over his head he dropped his jacket in his locker and pulled out his trapperkeeper stuffing it into his raindrenched backpack he spotted danny as planned danny was waiting outside the classroom door waiting to hear how todd had solved the worm mystery well i guess danny will just have to be disappointed too todd thought glumly he straightened his raiders cap and hoisting his wet backpack onto his shoulders made his way across the hall to his friend dannys red hair was soaked and matted down on his head it looked more like a helmet than hair todd pushed his way through a group of laughing shouting kids all shaking rainwater off themselves puddles on the hall floor at their feet so howd it go danny asked eagerly as todd stepped up to him todd started to tell his friend the bad news but he stopped when he heard a voice he instantly recognized regina around the corner out of view of the two boys regina and beth were sharing a good laugh so he has to dump out all those gross worms today regina was gleefully telling beth isnt that awesome awesome beth declared both girls laughed todd is such a jerk beth exclaimed did he really think the worms were crawling upstairs on their own did he really think they were coming to get him yeah i think he did regina said through her scornful laughter around the corner from the two girls danny and todd stood listening in shock neither of them moved a muscle todds mouth had dropped open he could feel his face growing redhot so todays the last day beth was saying did you put any worms in his stuff today only two regina replied mom gave him a thermos of hot vegetable soup since its such a nasty day i dropped one in the thermos and i slipped one into his jacket pocket hes on his way to school he probably stuck his hand in and found my little surprise both girls laughed again and he never guessed it was you the whole time beth asked regina he guessed regina replied but im such a good actress i acted shocked and totally grossed out pretty soon he didnt know what to think they laughed some more then todd heard them head the other way down the hall he turned to find danny staring at him todd do you believe it it was your sister the whole time i knew it todd lied trying to sound casual i knew it was regina well what are you going to do danny demanded still staring hard at todd get revenge of course todd replied quickly revenge how his friend asked im not sure todd told him i just know its going to take a lot of worms the rain stopped after lunch the heavy dark clouds drifted away and bright sunshine poured down from a clear blue sky todd eagerly watched the weather change through the classroom windows the sunshine filled him with hope this means the worms will be coming up from the ground he thought happily dozens and dozens of worms he was desperate to get out and collect them he was going to need a ton of worms to pay his sister back for her mean joke unfortunately just before school let out he and danny were caught having a glue fight during art class ms travianti the art teacher made them both stay after school and clean up all the paintbrushes it was nearly four oclock when todd led the way to his favorite wormcollecting spot behind second base of the softball diamond the playground was deserted there were no other kids in sight todd and danny both carried empty coffee cans they had borrowed from the art room without saying a word they bent down and set to work pulling up long brown and purple worms and dropping them into the cans how many do we need danny asked poking in the soft mud till he found a big wet one as many as we can get todd replied he still hadnt figured out exactly what he was going to do to regina he just knew it was going to be totally awesome and gross you really should pay back beth too danny suggested he dug a hole with his chubby hand and discovered three big worms tangled together yeah youre right todd agreed well save a bunch for beth todd stood up and pulled off his jacket even though it was late afternoon the sun still beamed down he was already sweating look at this one danny declared he held up a stubby pink worm its just a baby todd said toss it in the can anyway i need as many as i can get big or little danny dropped the stubby pink worm in with the others todd pulled up a really long one he carefully brushed clumps of mud off it before dropping it in the can the rain always brings up the really big ones he told danny the ground rumbled at first todd didnt notice did you feel that danny asked feel what the ground shook again todd heard a low rumbling sound like distant thunder hey danny cried alarmed he stopped digging that always happens todd told him no big deal keep digging danny dug his hand back into the mud but he jerked it out quickly when the ground shook again harder this time hey why is this happening again he cried i told you its nothing todd insisted but then a loud roar made them both cry out the entire playground seemed to tremble the roar grew louder closer the ground shook then both boys heard a cracking sound todd started to his feet but the ground shook so hard he tumbled back down to his knees craaaaaack oh no danny cried they both saw the dirt pull apart between them it looked like a dark wound opening up another rumble the ground quivered and shook the mud split open wider wider and something poked up from under the ground at first todd thought it was a tree trunk it was dark brown like a tree trunk and round like a tree trunk but it was moving too fast to be a tree rising up from the opening in the mud and as the ground shook and the rumbling rose to a roar todd and danny both realized that they were gaping in horror at a giant worm a worm as thick as a tree trunk up up it stretched up from the mud darting and dipping its enormous head todd uttered a shriek of terror and turned to run but his feet slipped on the wet quivering mud he fell forward landing hard on his knees and elbows and before he could pull himself up the enormous worm swung around him swung around his waist circled him pulled itself tight ohhh he uttered a cry of panic a crazy thought burst into todds head this is the mother worm shes come up to protect her babies and then another crazy thought the worms are really getting their revenge this time and then he had no more time for crazy thoughts or any other kinds of thoughts because the enormous worm was tightening itself around todds waist choking off his breath choking him choking him pulling him tugging him down into the mud down into its cavernous hole he tried to call for help but no sound came out of his mouth he couldnt yell he couldnt breathe the huge wet worm was crushing him crushing him as it pulled him down and then a dark shadow rolled over todd and everything went black danny grabbed todds feet and tried to pull him free but the worm had wrapped itself around todds waist like a tight belt danny pulled todds ankles pulled hard but he couldnt free his friend and now the worm was disappearing back into the gaping hole in the mud and taking todd down with him and suddenly they were all covered in shadow huh danny let out a startled gasp and raised his eyes to see what caused the shadow and saw the enormous robin bouncing along over the grass hey he frantically called out regina beth they were carrying the big papiermвchй bird home from school he couldnt see their faces they were hidden on the other side of the enormous robin regina help us and then the birds shadow rolled over danny and todd and the worm jerked straight up and began to tremble did it see the shadow of the bird it jerked straight up and let go of todd todd slid to the ground and the quivering worm began to lower itself instantly with a sickening sucking sound it dove back into the mud gasping for breath todd scrambled away on all fours the worm it thinks christopher robin is a real bird he realized when he glanced back the worm had vanished back under the ground regina beth todd and danny shouted together the two girls slowly lowered their science project to the ground what do you want what are you two doing here regina demanded poking her head around from the other side of the enormous robin did you see it todd cried breathlessly did you see the worm it was so huge danny added pulling todd to his feet it was as tall as a building haha beth said sarcastically you guys must think were really dumb no way were going to believe you caught a giant worm regina added shaking her head you didnt see it todd cried weakly you really didnt see it were not making it up danny shouted angrily it grabbed todd it was huge and brown and slimy it was pulling todd down give us a break beth groaned go eat worms regina said they hoisted up their giant robin and continued their slow trek toward the street todd watched the birds wide shadow roll over the grass the shadow that had saved his life then he turned to danny with a weary shrug might as well go home he said softly im not sure i believe it myself todd tossed all of his worms into the garden that afternoon he told everyone he never wanted to see a worm again when danny came over to todds house a few weeks later he found todd down in the basement busy with a new hobby what are you doing danny asked todds eyes remained on the fluttering creature inside the glass jar on the worktable im chloroforming this butterfly he told his friend huh what do you mean danny asked i dipped a wad of cotton in chloroform and dropped it into the jar it will kill the butterfly watch when the goldandblack butterfly stopped fluttering todd carefully opened the jar he lifted the butterfly out with long tweezers and gently spread its wings then he hung it on a board by sticking a long pin through its middle youre collecting butterflies now danny asked in surprise todd nodded butterflies are so gentle so pretty he said concentrating on his work todd has changed a lot regina announced appearing at the bottom of the stairs he isnt into gross anymore now hes into things that are soft and beautiful let me show you some of my most beautiful butterfly specimens todd told danny i have a few monarchs that will knock your eyes out everyone was happy about todds new hobby especially regina there were no more cruel practical jokes played in the barstow house then one night todd gazed up from his worktable and uttered a horrified cry as he saw the big creature fluttering toward him an enormous butterfly as big as a bedsheet carrying an enormous silver pin what are you going to do todd cried
