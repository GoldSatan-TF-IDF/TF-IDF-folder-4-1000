master of the asteroid clark ashton smith mans conquest of the interplanetary gulfs has been fraught with many tragedies vessel after vessel like venturous motes disappeared in the infinite and had not returned inevitably for the most part the lost explorers have left no record of their fate their ships have flared as unknown meteors through the atmosphere of the further planets to fall like shapeless metal cinders on a nevervisited terrain or have become the dead frozen satellites of other worlds or moons a few perhaps among the unreturning fliers have succeeded in landing somewhere and their crews have perished immediately or survived for a little while amid the inconceivably hostile environment of a cosmos not designed for men in later years with the progress of exploration more than one of the early derelicts has been descried following a solitary orbit and the wrecks of others have been found on ultraterrene shores occasionally not often it has been possible to reconstruct the details of the lone remote disaster sometimes in a fused and twisted hull a log or record has been preserved intact among others there is the case of the selenite the first known rocket ship to dare the zone of the asteroids at the time of its disappearance fifty years ago in a dozen voyages had been made to mars and a rocket base had been established in syrtis major with a small permanent colony of terrestrials all of whom were trained scientists as well as men of uncommon hardihood and physical stamina the effects of the martian climate and the utter alienation from familiar conditions as might have been expected were extremely trying and even disastrous there was an unremitting struggle with deadly or pestiferous bacteria new to science a perpetual assailment by dangerous radiations of soil and air and sun the lessened gravity played its part also in contributing to curious and profound disturbances of metabolism the worst effects were nervous and mental queer irrational animosities manias or phobias never classified by alienists began to develop among the personnel at the rocket base violent quarrels broke out between men who were normally controlled and urbane the party numbering fifteen in all soon divided into several cliques one against the others and this morbid antagonism led at times to actual fighting and even bloodshed one of the cliques consisted of three men roger colt phil gershom and edmond beverly these three through banding together in a curious fashion became intolerably antisocial toward all the others it would seem that they must have gone close to the borderline of insanity and were subject to actual delusions at any rate they conceived the idea that mars with its fifteen earthmen was entirely too crowded voicing this idea in a most offensive and belligerent manner they also began to hint their intention of faring even further afield in space their hints were not taken seriously by the others since a crew of three was insufficient for the proper manning of even the lightest rocket vessel used at that time colt gershom and beverly had no difficulty at all in stealing the selenite the smaller of the two ships then reposing at the syrtis major base their fellowcolonists were aroused one night by the cannonlike roar of the discharging tubes and emerged from their huts of sheetiron in time to see the vessel departing in a fiery streak toward jupiter no attempt was made to follow it but the incident helped to sober the remaining twelve and to calm their unnatural animosities it was believed from certain remarks that the malcontents had let drop that their particular objective was ganymede or europa both of which were thought to possess an atmosphere suitable for human respiration it seemed very doubtful however that they could pass the perilous belt of the asteroids apart from the difficulty of steering a course amid these innumerable farstrewn bodies the selenite was not fueled or provisioned for a voyage of such length gershom colt and beverly in their mad haste to quit the company of the others had forgotten to calculate the actual necessities of their proposed voyage and had wholly overlooked its dangers after that departing flash on the martian skies the selenite was not seen again and its fate remained a mystery for thirty years then on tiny remote phocea its dented wreck was found by the holdane expedition to the asteroids phocea at the time of the expeditions visit was in aphelion like others of the planetoids it was discovered to possess a rare atmosphere too thin for human breathing both hemispheres were covered with thin snow and lying amid this snow the selenite was sighted by the explorers as they circled about the little world much interest prevailed for the shape of the partially bare mound was plainly recognizable and not to be confused with the surrounding rocks holdane ordered a landing and several men in space suits proceeded to examine the wreck they soon identified it as the longmissing selenite peering in through one of the thick unbreakable neocrystal ports they met the eyeless gaze of a human skeleton which had fallen forward against the slanting overhanging wall it seemed to grin a sardonic welcome the vessels hull was partly buried in the stony soil and had been crumpled and even slightly fused though not broken by its plunge the manhole lid was so thoroughly jammed and soldered that it was impossible to effect an entrance without the use of a cuttingtorch enormous withered cryptogamous plants with the habit of vines that crumbled at a touch were clinging to the hull and the adjacent rocks in the light snow beneath the skeletonguarded port a number of sharded bodies were lying which proved to be those of tall insect forms like giant phasmidae from the posture and arrangement of their lank pipy members longer than those of a man it seemed that they had walked erect they were unimaginably grotesque and their composition due to the almost nonexistent gravity was fantastically porous and unsubstantial many other bodies of a similar type were afterwards found on other portions of the planetoid but no living thing was discovered all life it was plain had perished in the transarctic winter of phoceas aphelion when the selenite had been entered the party learned from a sort of log or notebook found on the floor that the skeleton was all that remained of edmond beverly there was no trace of his two companions but the log on examination proved to contain a record of their fate as well as the subsequent adventures of beverly almost to the very moment of his own death from a doubtful unexplained cause the tale was a strange and tragic one beverly it would seem had written it day by day after the departure from syrtis major in an effort to retain a semblance of morale and mental coherence amid the black alienation and disorientation of infinitude i transcribe it herewith omitting only the earlier passages which were full of unimportant details and personal animadversions the first entries were all dated and beverly had made an heroic attempt to measure and mark off the seasonless night of the void in terms of earthly time but after the disastrous landing on phocea he had abandoned this and the actual length of time covered by his entries can only be conjectured sept th mars is only a palered star through our rear ports and according to my calculations we will soon approach the orbit of the nearest asteroids jupiter and its system of moons are seemingly as far off as ever like beacons on the unattainable shore of immensity more even than at first i feel that dreadful suffocation illusion which accompanies ethertravel of being perfectly stationary in a static void gershom however complains of a disturbance of equilibrium with much vertigo and a frequent sense of falling as if the vessel were sinking beneath him through bottomless space at a headlong speed the causation of such symptoms is rather obscure since the artificial gravity regulators are in good working order colt and i have not suffered from any similar disturbance it seems to me that the sense of falling would be almost a relief from this illusion of nightmare immobility but gershom appears to be greatly distressed by it and says that his hallucination is growing stronger with fewer and briefer intervals of normalcy he fears that it will become continuous sept th colt has made an estimate of our fuel and provisions and thinks that with careful husbandry we will be able to reach europa i have been checking up on his calculations and find that he is altogether too sanguine according to my estimate the fuel will give out while we are still midway in the belt of the asteroids though the food water and compressed air would possibly take us most of the way to europa this discovery i must conceal from the others it is too late to turn back i wonder if we have all been mad to start out on this errant voyage into cosmical immensity with no real preparation or thought of consequences colt it would seem has lost the power of mathematical calculation his figures are full of the most egregious errors gershom has been unable to sleep and is not even fit to take his turn at the watch the hallucination of falling obsesses him perpetually and he cries out in terror thinking that the vessel is about to crash on some dark unknown planet to which it is being drawn by an irresistible gravitation eating drinking and locomotion are very difficult for him and he complains that he cannot even draw a full breath that the air is snatched away from him in his precipitate descent his condition is indeed painful and pitiable sept th gershom is worse bromide of potassium and even a heavy dose of morphine from the selenites medicine lockers have not relieved him or enabled him to sleep he has the look of a drowning man and seems to be on the point of strangulation it is hard for him to speak colt has become very morose and sullen and snarls at me when i address him i think that gershoms plight has preyed sorely upon his nerves as it has on mine but my burden is heavier than colts for i know the inevitable doom of our insane and illstarred expedition sometimes i wish it were all over the hells of the human mind are vaster than space darker than the night between the worlds and all three of us have spent several eternities in hell our attempt to flee has only plunged us into a black and shoreless limbo through which we are fated to carry still our own private perdition i too like gershom have been unable to sleep but unlike him i am tormented by the illusion of eternal immobility in spite of the daily calculations that assure me of our progress through the gulf i cannot convince myself that we have moved at all it seems to me that we hang suspended like mohammeds coffin remote from earth and equally remote from the stars in an incommensurable vastness without bourn or direction i cannot describe the awfulness of the feeling sept th during my watch colt opened the medicine locker and managed to shoot himself full of morphine when his turn came he was in a stupor and i could do nothing to rouse him gershom had gotten steadily worse and seemed to be enduring a thousand deaths so there was nothing for me to do but keep on with the watch as long as i could i locked the controls anyway so that the vessel would continue its course without human guidance if i should fall asleep i dont know how long i kept awake nor how long i slept i was aroused by a queer hissing whose nature and cause i could not identify at first i looked around and saw that colt was in his hammock still lying in a druginduced sopor then i saw that gershom was gone and began to realize that the hissing came from the airlock the inner door of the lock was closed securely but evidently someone had opened the outer manhole and the sound was being made by the escaping air it grew fainter and ceased as i listened i knew then what had happened gershom unable to endure his strange hallucination any longer had actually flung himself into space from the selenite going to the rear ports i saw his body with a pale slightly bloated face and open bulging eyes it was following us like a satellite keeping an even distance of ten or twelve feet from the lee of the vessels stern i could have gone out in a space suit to retrieve the body but i felt sure that gershom was already dead and the effort seemed more than useless since there was no leakage of air from the interior i did not even try to close the manhole i hope and pray that gershom is at peace he will float forever in cosmic space and in that further void where the torment of human consciousness can never follow sept th we have kept our course somehow though colt is too demoralized and drugsodden to be of much assistance i pity him when the limited supply of morphine gives out gershoms body is still following us held by the slight power of the vessels gravitational attraction it seems to terrify colt in his more lucid moments and he complains that we are being haunted by the dead man its bad enough for me too and i wonder how much my nerves and mind will stand sometimes i think that i am beginning to develop the delusion that tortured gershom and drove him to his death an awful dizziness assails me and i fear that i shall start to fall but somehow i regain my equilibrium sept th colt used up all the morphine and began to show signs of intense depression and uncontrollable nervousness his fear of the satellite corpse appeared to grow upon him like an obsession and i could do nothing to reassure him his terror was deepened by an eerie superstitious belief i tell you i hear gershom calling us he cried he wants company out there in the black frozen emptiness and he wont leave the vessel till one of us goes out to join him youve got to go beverly its either you or me otherwise hell follow the selenite forever i tried to reason with him but in vain he turned upon me in a sudden shift of maniacal rage damn you ill throw you out if you wont go any other way he shrieked clawing and mouthing like a mad beast he leaped toward me where i sat before the selenites controlboard i was almost overborne by his onset for he fought with a wild and frantic strength i dont like to write down all that happened for the mere recollection makes me sick finally he got me by the throat with a sharpnailed clutch that i could not loosen and began to choke me to death in selfdefense i had to shoot him with an automatic which i carried in my pocket reeling dizzily gasping for breath i found myself staring down at his prostrate body from which a crimson puddle was widening on the floor somehow i managed to put on a space suit dragging colt by the ankles i got him to the inner door of the airlock when i opened the door the escaping air hurled me toward the open manhole together with the corpse and it was hard to regain my footing and avoid being carried through into space colts body turning traversely in its movement was jammed across the manhole and i had to thrust it out with my hands then i closed the lid after it when i returned to the ships interior i saw it floating pale and bloated beside the corpse of gershom sept th i am alone and yet most horribly i am pursued and companioned by the dead men i have sought to concentrate my faculties on the hopeless problem of survival on the exigencies of space navigation but it is all useless ever i am aware of those stiff and swollen bodies swimming in the awful silence of the void with the white airless sun like a leprosy of light on their upturned faces i try to keep my eyes on the controlboard on the astronomic charts on the log i am writing on the stars toward which i am travelling but a frightful and irresistible magnetism makes me turn at intervals and mechanically helplessly to the rearward ports there are no words for what i feel and think and words are as lost things along with the worlds i have left so far behind i sink in a chaos of vertiginous horror beyond all possibility of return sept th i am entering the zone of the asteroids those desert rocks fragmentary and amorphous that whirl in farscattered array between mars and jupiter today the selenite passed very close to one of them a small body like a brokenoff mountain which heaved suddenly from the gulf with knifesharp pinnacles and black gullies that seemed to cleave to its very heart the selenite would have crashed full upon it in a few instants if i had not reversed the power and steered in an abrupt diagonal to the right as it was i passed near enough for the bodies of colt and gershom to be caught by the gravitational pull of the planetoid and when i looked back at the receding rock after the vessel was out of danger they had disappeared from sight finally i located them with the telescopic reflector and saw that they were revolving in space like infinitesimal moons about that awful naked asteroid perhaps they will float thus forever or will drift gradually down in lessening circles to find a tomb in one of those bleak bottomless ravines sept th i have passed several more of the asteroids irregular fragments little larger than meteoric stones and all my skill of spacemanship has been taxed severely to avert collision because of the need for unrelaxing vigilance i have been compelled to keep awake at all times but sooner or later sleep will overpower me and the selenite will crash to destruction after all it matters little the end is inevitable and must come soon enough in any case the store of concentrated food the tanks of compressed oxygen might keep me alive for many months since there is no one but myself to consume them but the fuel is almost gone as i know from my former calculations at any moment the propulsion may cease then the vessel will drift idly and helplessly in this cosmic limbo and be drawn to its doom on some asteroidal reef sep st everything i have expected has happened and yet by some miracle of chance or mischance i am still alive the fuel gave out yesterday but i was too close to the nadir of physical and mental exhaustion to realize clearly that the rocketexplosions had ceased i was dead for want of sleep and had gotten into a state beyond hope or despair dimly i remember setting the vessels controls through automatic force of habit and then i lashed myself in my hammock and fell asleep instantly i have no means of guessing how long i slept vaguely in the gulf beyond dreams i heard a crash as of faroff thunder and felt a violent vibration that jarred me into dull wakefulness a sensation of unnatural sweltering heat began to oppress me as i struggled toward consciousness but when i had opened my heavy eyes i was unable to determine for some little time what had really happened twisting my head so that i could peer out through one of the ports i was startled to see on a purpleblack sky an icy glittering horizon of sawedged rocks for an instant i thought that the vessel was about to strike on some looming planetoid then overwhelmingly i realized that the crash had already occurred that i had been awakened from my comalike slumber by the falling of the selenite upon one of those cosmic islets i was wideawake now and i hastened to unlash myself from the hammock i found that the floor was pitched sharply as if the vessel had landed on a slope or had buried its nose in the alien terrain feeling a queer disconcerting lightness and barely able to reestablish my feet on the floor i gradually made my way to the nearest port it was plain that the artificial gravitysystem of the flier had been thrown out of commission by the crash and that i was now subject only to the feeble gravitation of the asteroid it seemed to me that i was light and incorporeal as a cloud that i was no more than the airy specter of my former self the floor and walls were strangely hot and it came to me that the heating must have been caused by the passage of the selenite through some sort of atmosphere the asteroid then was not wholly airless as such bodies are commonly supposed to be and probably it was one of the larger fragments with a diameter of many miles perhaps hundreds but even this realization failed to prepare me for the weird and surprising scene upon which i gazed through the port the horizon of serrate peaks like a miniature mountainrange lay at a distance of several hundred yards above it the small intensely brilliant sun like a fiery moon in its magnitude was sinking with visible rapidity in the dark sky that revealed the major stars and planets the selenite had plunged into a shallow valley and had halfburied its prow and bottom in a soil that was formed by decomposing rock mainly basaltic all about were fretted ridges guttering pillars and pinnacles and over these amazingly there clambered frail pipy leafless vines with broad yellowgreen tendrils flat and thin as paper insubstantiallooking lichens taller than a man and having the form of flat antlers grew in single rows and thickets along the valley between the thickets i saw the approach of certain living creatures who rose from behind the middle rocks with the suddenness and lightness of leaping insects they seemed to skim the ground with long flying steps that were both easy and abrupt there were five of these beings who no doubt had been attracted by the fall of the selenite from space and were coming to inspect it in a few moments they neared the vessel and paused before it with the same effortless ease that had marked all their movements what they really were i do not know but for want of other analogies i must liken them to insects standing perfectly erect they towered seven feet in air their eyes like faceted opals at the end of curving protractile stalks rose level with the port their unbelievably thin limbs their stemlike bodies comparable to those of the phasmidae or walkingsticks were covered with graygreen shards their heads triangular in shape were flanked with immense perforated membranes and were fitted with mandibular mouths that seemed to grin eternally i think that they saw me with those weird inexpressive eyes for they drew nearer pressing against the very port till i could have touched them with my hand if the port had been open perhaps they too were surprised for the thin eyestalks seemed to lengthen as they stared and there was a queer waving of their sharded arms a quivering of their horny mouths as if they were holding converse with each other after a while they went away vanishing swiftly beyond the near horizon since then i have examined the selenite as fully as possible to ascertain the extent of the damage i think that the outer hull has been crumpled or even fused in places for when i approached the manhole clad in a space suit with the idea of emerging i found that i could not open the lid my exit from the flier has been rendered impossible since i have no tools with which to cut the heavy metal or shatter the tough neocrystal ports i am sealed in the selenite as in a prison and the prison in due time must also become my tomb later i shall no longer try to date this record it is impossible under the circumstances to retain even an approximate sense of earthly time the chronometers have ceased running and their machinery has been hopelessly jarred by the vessels fall the diurnal periods of this planetoid are it would seem no more than an hour or two in duration and the nights are equally short darkness swept upon the landscape like a black wing after i had finished writing my last entry and since then so many of these ephemeral days and nights have shuttled by that i have now ceased to count them my very sense of duration is becoming oddly confused now that i have grown somewhat used to my situation the brief days drag with immeasurable tedium the beings whom i call the walkingsticks have returned to the vessel coming daily and bringing scores and hundreds of others it would seem that they correspond in some measure to humanity being the dominant lifeform of this little world in most ways they are incomprehensibly alien but certain of their actions bear a remote kinship to those of men and suggest similar impulses and instincts evidently they are curious they crowd around the selenite in great numbers inspecting it with their stalkborne eyes touching the hull and ports with their attenuated members i believe they are trying to establish some sort of communication with me i cannot be sure that they emit vocal sounds since the hull of the flier is soundproof but i am sure that the stiff semaphoric gestures which they repeat in a certain order before the port as soon as they catch sight of me are fraught with conscious and definite meaning also i surmise an actual veneration in their attitude such as would be accorded by savages to some mysterious visitant from the heavens each day when they gather before the ship they bring curious spongy fruits and porous vegetable forms which they leave like a sacrificial offering on the ground by their gestures they seem to implore me to accept these offerings oddly enough the fruits and vegetables always disappear during the night they are eaten by large luminous flying creatures with filmy wings that seem to be wholly nocturnal in their habits doubtless however the walkingsticks believe that i the strange ultrastellar god have accepted the sacrifice it is all strange unreal immaterial the loss of normal gravity makes me feel like a phantom and i seem to live in a phantom world my thoughts my memories my despair all are no more than mists that waver on the verge of oblivion and yet by some fantastic irony i am worshipped as a god innumerable days have gone by since i made the last entry in this log the seasons of the asteroid have changed the days have grown briefer the nights longer and a bleak wintriness pervades the valley the frail flat vines are withering on the rocks and the tall lichenthickets have assumed funereal autumn hues of madder and mauve the sun revolves in a low arc above the sawtoothed horizon and its orb is small and pale as if it were receding into the black gulf among the stars the people of the asteroid appear less often they seem fewer in number and their sacrificial gifts are rare and scant no longer do they bring spongelike fruits but only pale and porous fungi that seem to have been gathered in caverns they move slowly as if the winter cold were beginning to numb them yesterday three of them fell after depositing their gifts and lay still before the flier they have not moved and i feel sure that they are dead the luminous nightflying creatures have ceased to come and the sacrifices remain undisturbed beside their bearers the awfulness of my fate has closed upon me today no more of the walkingsticks have appeared i think that they have all died the ephemerae of this tiny world that is bearing me with it into the arctic limbo of the solar system doubtless their lifetime corresponds only to its summer to its perihelion thin clouds have gathered in the dark air and snow is falling like fine powder i feel an unspeakable desolation a dreariness that i cannot write the heatingapparatus of the selenite is still in good workingorder so the cold cannot reach me but the black frost of space has fallen upon my spirit strange i did not feel so utterly bereft and alone while the insect people came daily now that they come no more i seem to have been overtaken by the ultimate horror of solitude by the chill terror of an alienation beyond life i can write no longer for my brain and my heart fail me still it would seem i live after an eternity of darkness and madness in the flier of death and winter in the world outside during that time i have not written in the log and i know not what obscure impulse prompts me to resume a practice so irrational and futile i think it is the sun passing in a higher and longer arc above the dead landscape that has called me back from the utterness of despair the snow has melted from the rocks forming little rills and pools of water and strange plantbuds are protruding from the sandy soil they lift and swell visibly as i watch them i am beyond hope beyond life in a weird vacuum but i see these beings as a condemned captive sees the stirring of spring from his cell they rouse in me an emotion whose very name i had forgotten my foodsupply is getting low and the reserve of compressed air is even lower i am afraid to calculate how much longer it will last i have tried to break the neocrystal ports with a large monkeywrench for hammer but the blows owing partly to my own weightlessness are futile as the tapping of a feather anyway in all likelihood the outside air would be too thin for human respiration the walkingstick people have reappeared before the flier i feel sure from their lesser height their brighter coloring and the immature development of certain members that they all represent a new generation none of my former visitors have survived the winter but somehow the new ones seem to regard the selenite and me with the same curiosity and reverence that were shown by their elders they too have begun to bring gifts of unsubstantiallooking fruit and they strew filmy blossoms below the port i wonder how they propagate themselves and how knowledge is transmitted from one generation to another the flat lichenous vines are mounting on the rocks are clambering over the hull of the selenite the young walkingsticks gather daily to worship they make those enigmatic signs which i have never understood and they move in swift gyrations about the vessel as in the measures of a hieratic dance i the lost and doomed have been the god of two generations perhaps they will still worship me when i am dead i think the air is almost gone i am more lightheaded than usual today and there is a queer constriction in my throat and chest perhaps i am a little delirious and have begun to imagine things but i have just perceived an odd phenomenon hitherto unnoted i dont know what it is a thin columnar mist moving and writhing like a serpent with opal colors that change momently has disappeared among the rocks and is approaching the vessel it seems like a live thing like a vaporous entity and somehow it is poisonous and inimical it glides forward rearing above the throng of phasmidae who have all prostrated themselves as if in fear i see it more clearly now it is half transparent with a web of gray threads among its changing colors and it is putting forth a long wavering tentacle it is some rare lifeform unknown to earthly science and i cannot even surmise its nature and attributes perhaps it is the only one of its kind on the asteroid no doubt it has just discovered the presence of the selenite and has been drawn by curiosity like the walkingstick people the tentacle has touched the hull it has reached the port behind which i stand penciling these words the gray threads in the tentacle glow as if with sudden fire my god it is coming through the neocrystal lens
