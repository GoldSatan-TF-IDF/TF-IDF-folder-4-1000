happy birthday dear jesus it was the craziest christmas i ever spent partly it was heinemanns fault he came up with a new wrinkle in giftwrapping that looked good but like every other idea that comes out of the front office meant plenty of headaches for the rest of us but what really messed up christmas for me was the girl personnel sent her down after id gone up there myself three times and banged my fist on the table it was the height of the season and when she told me that she had had her application in three weeks before they called her i excused myself and got personnel on the store phone from my private office martin here i said what the devils the matter with you people this girl is the emporium type if i ever saw one and youve been letting her sit around nearly a month while crawford the personnel head interrupted me have you talked to her very much he wanted to know vell no but call me back when you do he advised and clicked off i went back to the stockroom where she was standing patiently and looked her over a little thoughtfully but she looked all right to me she was blondhaired and blueeyed and not very big she had a sweet slow smile she wasnt exactly beautiful but she looked like a girl youd want to know she wasnt bold and she wasnt too shy and thats a perfect description of what we call the emporium type so what in the world was the matter with personnel her name was lilymary hargreave i put her to work on the giftwrap spraying machine while i got busy with my paper work i have a hundred fortyone persons in the department and at the height of the christmas season i could use twice as many but we do get the work done for instance saul capell the next biggest store in town has a hundred and sixty in their gift and counseling department and their sales run easily twentyfive per cent less than ours and in the four years that ive headed the department weve yet to fail to get an order delivered when it was promised all through that morning i kept getting glimpses of the new girl she was a quick learner smart too smart to be stuck with the sprayer for very long i needed someone like her around and right there on the spot i made up my mind that if she was as good as she looked id put her in a counseling booth within a week and the devil with what personnel thought the store was packed with lastminute shoppers i suppose im sentimental but i love to watch the thousands of people bustling in and out with all the displays going at once and the lights on the trees and the loudspeakers playing white christmas and the eighth candle and jingle bells and all the other traditional old favorites christmas is more than a mere seffing season of the year to me it means something the girl called me over near closing time she looked distressed and with some reason there was a dolly ifiled with giftwrapped packages and a man from shipping looking annoyed she said im sorry mr martin but i seem to have done something wrong the shipping man snorted look for yourself mr martin he said handing me one of the packages i looked it was wrong all right heinemanns new wrinkle that year was a special attached gift card a simple yule scene and the printed message the very merriest of seasons greetings from to the price varied with the item of course heinemanns idea was for the customer to fill it out and mail it ahead of time to the person it was intended for that way the person who got it would know just about how much he ought to spend on a present for the first person it was smart i admit and maybe the smartest thing about it was rounding the price off to the nearest fifty cents instead of giving it exactly heinemann said it was badmannered to be too precise and the way the customers were going for the idea it had to be right but the trouble was that the giftwrapping machines were geared to only a plain card it was necessary for the operator to put the price in by hand i said thats all right joe ill take care of it as joe went satisfled back to shipping i told the girl its my fault i should have explained to you but i guess ive just been a little too rushed she looked downcast im sorry she said nothing to be sorry about i showed her the routing slip attached to each one which the shipping department kept for its records once the package was on its way all we have to do is go through these the price is on every one well just fill out the cards and get them out i guess i looked at my watch i guess youll be a little late tonight but ill see that you get overtime and dinner money for it it wasnt your mistake after all she said hesitantly mr martin couldnt it well can i let it go for tonight it isnt that i mind working but i keep house for my f ather and if i dont get there on time he just wont remember to eat dinner please i suppose i frowned a little because her expression was a little worried but after all it was her first day i said miss hargreave dont give it a thought ill take care of it the way i took care of it it turned out was to do it myself it was late when i got through and i ate quickly and went home to bed but i didnt mind for oh the sweetness of the smile she gave me as she left i looked forward to the next morning because i was looking forward to seeing lilymary hargreave again but my luck was out for she was my numbertwo man johnny furness reported that she hadnt phoned either i called personnel to get her phone number but they didnt have it i got the address but the phone company had no phone listed under her name so i stewed around until the coffee break and then i put my hat on and headed out of the store it wasnt merely that i was interested in seeing her i told myself she was just too good a worker to get off on the wrong foot this way and it was only simple justice for me to go to her home and set her straight her house was in a nondescript neighborhood not too good not too bad a gang of kids were playing under a fire hydrant at the corner but on the other hand the houses were neat and nearly new middleclass youd have to say i found the address and knocked on the door of a secondfloor apartment it was opened by a tall leathery man of fifty or so lilymarys father i judged good morning i said is miss hargreave at home he smiled his teeth were bright in a very sunbronzed face which one blond girl medium height blue eyes is there more than one there are four but you mean lilymary wont you come in i followed him and a sixyearold edition of lilymary took my hat and gravely hung it on a rack made of bamboo pegs the leathery man said im morton hargreave lilys father shes in the kitchen george martin i said he nodded and left me for the kitchen i presumed i sat down on an oldfashioned studio couch in the living room and the sixyearold sat on the edge of a straightbacked chair across from me making sure i didnt pocket any of the souvenirs on the mantel the room was full of curiosities what looked like a cloth of beaten bark hanging on one wall with a throwingspear slung over the cloth everything looked vaguely southseas though i am no expert the sixyearold said seriously this is the man lilymary and i got up good morning said lilymary hargreave with a smudge of flour and an expression of concern on her face i said floundering i uh noticed you hadnt come in and well since you were new to the emporium i thought i am sorry mr martin she said didnt personnel tell you about sundays what about sundays i must have my sundays off she explained mr crawford said it was very unusual but i really cant accept the job any other way sundays off i repeated but but miss hargreave dont you see what that does to my schedule sundays our busiest day the emporium isnt a rich mans shop our customers work during the week if we arent staffed to serve them when they can come in we just arent doing the job they expect of us she said sincerely im terribly sorry mr martin the sixyearold was already reaching for my hat from the doorway her father said heartily come back again mr martin well be glad to see you he escorted me to the door as lilymary smiled and nodded and headed back to the kitchen i said mr hargreave wont you ask lilymary to come in for the afternoon at least i hate to sound like a boss but im really shorthanded on weekends right now at the peak of the season season the christmas season i explained nearly ninety per cent of our annual business is done in the christmas season and a good half of it on weekends so wont you ask her he shook his head six days the lord labored mr martin he boomed and the seventh was the day of rest im sorry and there i was outside the apartment and the door closing politely but implacably behind me crazy people i rode the subway back to the store in an irritable mood i bought a paper but i didnt read it because every time i looked at it all i saw was the date that showed me how far the christmas season already had advanced how little time we had left to make our quotas and beat last years record the eighth of september i would have something to say to miss lilymary hargreave when she had the kindness to show up at her job i promised myself but as it turned out i didnt because that night checking through the days manifolds when everyone else had gone home i fell in love with lilymary hargreave possibly that sounds silly to you she wasnt even there and id only known her for a few hours and when a man begins to push thirty without ever being married you begin to think hes a hard case and not likely to fall slambang impetuously in love like a teenager after his first divorce but its true all the same i almost called her up i trembled on the brink of it with my hand on the phone but it was close to midnight and if she wasnt home getting ready for bed i didnt want to know it so i went home to my own bed i reached under the pillow and turned off my dreamster before i went to sleep i had a full library for it a de luxe model with five hundred dreams that had been a present from the finn the christmas before i had haroun al rashids harem and three of charles seconds favorites on tape and i had rocketing around the moon and diving to atlantis and winning a sweepstakes and getting elected king of the world but what i wanted to dream about was not on anybodys tape and its name was lilymary hargreave monday lasted forever but at the end of forever when the tip of the nightingales wing had brushed away the mountain of steel and the shipping personnel were putting on their hats and coats and powder ing their noses or combing their hair i stepped right up to lilymary hargreave and asked her to go to dinner with me she looked astonished but only for a moment then she smiled i have mentioned the sweetness of her smil its wonderful of you to ask me mr martin she said earnestly and i do appreciate it but i cant please i said i am sorry i might have said please again and i might have fallen to my knees at her feet it was that important to me but the staff was still in the shop and how would it look for the head of the department to fall at the feet of his newest employee i said woodenly thats too bad and i nodded and turned away leaving her frowning after me i cleared my desk sloppily chucking the invoices in a drawer and i was halfway out the door when i heard her calling after me mr martin mr martin she was hurrying toward me breathless im sorry she said i didnt mean to scream at you but i just phoned my father and i thought you didnt have a phone i said accusingly she blinked at me at the rectory she explained anyway i just phoned him and well wed both be delighted if you would come and have dinner with us at home wonderful words the whole complexion of the shipping room changed in a moment i beamed foolishly at her with a soft surge at my heart i felt happy enough to endow a home strong enough to kill a cave bear or give up smoking or any crazy mixedup thing i wanted to shout and sing but all i said was that sounds great we headed for the subway and although i must have talked to her on the ride i cannot remember a word we said only that she looked like the angel at the top of our tallest christmas tree dinner was good and there was plenty of it cooked by lilymary herself and i think i must have seemed a perfect idiot i sat there with the sixyearold on one side of me and lilymary on the other across from the tenyearold and the twelveyearold the father of them all was at the head of the table but he was the only other male i understood there were a couple of brothers but they didnt live with the others i suppose there had been a mother at some time unless morton hargreave stamped the girls out with a kind of cookiecutter but whatever she had been she appeared to be deceased i felt overwhelmed i wasnt used to being surrounded by young females particularly as young as the median in that gathering lilymary made an attempt to talk to me but it wasnt altogether successful the younger girls were given to fits of giggling which she had to put a stop to and to making what were evidently personal remarks in some kind of a peculiar foreign tongue it sounded like a weird aboriginal dialect and i later found out that it was but it was disconcerting especially from the lips of a sixyearold with the giggles so i didnt make any very intelligent responses to lilymarys overtures but all things end even eating dinner with giggling girls and then mr hargreave and i sat in the little parlor waiting for the girls to finish doing the dishes i said shocked mr hargreave do you mean they wash them certainly they wash them he boomed mildly how else would they get them clean mr martin why dishwashers mr hargreave i looked at him in a different way business is business i said after all this is the christmas season at the emporium we put a very high emphasis on dishwashers as a christmas gift you know we he interrupted goodhumoredly i already have my gifts mr martin four of them and very fine dishwashers they are but mr hargreave not mister hargreave the sixyearold was standing beside me looking disapproving doctor hargreave corinne said her father forgive her mr martin but you see were not very used to the uh civilized way of doing things weve been a long time with the dyaks the girls were all back from the kitchen and lilymary was out of her apron and looking unbelievable entertainment she said brightly mr martin would you like to hear corinne play there was a piano in the corner i said hastily im crazy about piano music but lilymary laughed shes good she told me seriously even if i do have to say it to her face but well let you off that if you like gretchen and i sing a little bit if youd prefer it wasnt there any tv in this place i felt as out of place as an easterbunnyhelper in the santa claus line but lilymary was still looking unbelievable so i sat through lilymary and the twelveyearold named gretchen singing ancient songs while the sixyearold named corinne accompanied them on the piano it was pretty thick then the tenyearold whose name i never did catch did recitations and then they all looked expectantly at me i cleared my throat slightly embarrassed lilymary said quickly oh you dont have to do anything mr martin its just our custom but we dont expect strangers to conform to it i didnt want that word stranger to stick i said oh but id like to i mean im not much good at public enfertaining but i hesitated because that was the truest thing i had ever said i had no more voice than a goat and of course the only instrument i had ever learned to play was a tv set but then i remembered something from my childhood ill tell you what i said enthusiastically how would you like something appropriate to the season a visit from santa claus for instance gretchen said snappishly what season we dont start celebrating her father cut her off please do mr martin he said politely wed enjoy that very much i cleared my throat and started tis the season of christmas and all through the house st nick and his helpers begin their carouse the closets are stuffed and the drawers overflowing with giftwrapped remembrances coming and going what a joyous abandon of christmastime glow what a making of lists what a spending of dough so much for hey said gretchen looking revolted daddy that isnt how hush said dr hargreave grimly his own expression wasnt very delighted either but he said please go on i began to wish id kept my face shut they were all looking at me very peculiarly except for lilymary who was conscientiously studying the floor but it was too late to back out i went on so much for the bedroom so much for the bath so much for the kitchen too little by half come westinghouse philco come hotpoint ge come sunbeam come mixmaster come to the tree so much for the wardrobe how shine daddys eyes as he reaps his yule harvest of slippers and ties so much for the family so much for the friends so much for the neighbors the list never ends a contingency fund for the givers belated whose gifts must be hastily reciprocated and out of gretchen stood up its our bedtime she said good night everybody lilymary flared it is not now be still and she looked at me for the first time please go on she said with a furrowed brow i said hoarsely and out of the shops how they spring with a clatter the gifts and appliances words cannot flatter the robot dishwasher the new frigidaire the doll with the didy and curlable hair the electrified hairbrush the black lingerie the fullcolor stereoscopic tv come credit department come personal loan come mortgage come christmas club come lilymary turned her face away i stopped and licked my lips thats all i remember i lied i im sorry if dr hargreave shook himself like a man waking from a nightmare its getting rather late he said to lilymary perhaps perhaps our guest would enjoy some coffee before he goes i declined the coffee and lilymary walked me to the subway we didnt talk much at the subway entrance she firmly took my hand and shook it its been a pleasant evening she said a wandering group of carolers came by i gave my contribution to the guitarist suddenly angry i said doesnt that mean anything to you what i gestured after the carolers that christmas the whole sentimental lovable warmhearted business of christmas lilymary weve only known each other a short time but she interrupted please mr martin i i know what youre going to say she looked terribly appealing there in the christmassy light of the red and green lights from the tree that marked the subway entrance her pale straight legs hardly concealed by the shorts picked up chromatic highlights her eyes sparkled she said you see as daddy says weve been away from civilization daddy is a missionary and weve been with the dyaks since i was a little girl gretch and marlene and corinne were born there we we do things differently on borneo she looked up at the tree over us and sighed its very hard to get used to she said sometimes i wish we had stayed with the dyaks then she looked at me she smiled but sometimes she said i am very glad were here and she was gone ambiguous call it merely ladylike at any rate thats what i called it i took it to be the beginning of the kind of feeling i so desperately wanted her to have and for the second night in a row i let harouns harem beauties remain silent on their tapes calamity struck my numbertwo man furness turned up one morning with a dismal expression and a letter in a governmentfranked envelope greeting it began you are summoned to serve with a jury of citizens for the term jury duty i groaned at a time like this wait a minute johnny ill call up mr heinemann he might be able to fix it if furness was shaking his head sorry mr martin i already asked him and he tried but no go its a big case blindfold sampling of twelve brands of filter cigarettes and mr heinemann says it wouldnt look right to try to evade it so there was breaking another man in to add to my troubles it meant overtime and that meant that i didnt have as much time as i would like for lilymary lunch together a couple of times odd moments between runs of the giftwrapping machines that was about it but she was never out of my thoughts there was something about her that appealed to me a square yes unworldly yes her family a victorian horror but they were her family i determined to get them on my side and by and by i began to see how miss hargreave i said formally coming out of my office we stepped to one side in a corner under the delivery chutes the rumble of goods overhead gave us privacy i said lilymary youre taking this sunday off as usual may i come to visit you she hesitated only a second why of course she said firmly wed be delighted for dinner i shook my head i have a little surprise for you i whispered she looked alarmed not for you exactly for the kids trust me lilymary about four oclock in the afternoon i winked at her and went back to my office to make arrangements it wasnt the easiest thing in the world it was our busy season as i say but whats the use of being the boss if you cant pull rank once in a while so i made it as strong as i could and special services hemmed and hawed and finally agreed that they would work in a special visit from santa claus at the hargreave home that sunday afternoon once the kids were on my side i plotted craftily it would be easy enough to work the old man around and what kid could resist a visit from santa claus i rang the bell and walked into the queer southseas living room as though i belonged there merry christmas i said genially to the sixyearold who let me in i hope you kiddies are ready for a treat treat she looked at me incredulously and disappeared i heard her say something shrill and protesting in the next room and lilymarys voice being firm and lowtoned then lilymary appeared hello mr martin she said george hello george she sat down and patted the sofa beside her would you like some lemonade she asked thank you i said it was pretty hot for the end of september and the place didnt appear to be airconditioned she called and the twelveyearold gretchen turned up with a pitcher and some cookies i said warningly mustnt get too full little girl theres a surprise coming lilymary cleared her throat as her sister set the tray down with a clatter and stamped out of the room i i wish youd tell me about this surprise george she said you know were a little well set in our ways and i wonder nothing to worry about lilymary i reassured her what is it a couple of minutes before four theyll be here any minute they i looked around the kids were out of sight santa claus and his helpers i whispered she began piercingly santa cl ssh i nodded toward the door i want it to be a surprise for the kids please dont spoil it for them lilymary well she opened her mouth but she didnt get a chance to say anything the bell rang santa claus and his helpers were right on time lilymary shrieked the twelveyearold opening the door look you couldnt blame the kid for being excited hohoho boomed santa rolling inside oh hello mr martin this the place certainly santa i said beaming bring it in boys the twelveyearold cried corinne marlene this you got to see there was an odd tone to her voice but i didnt pay much at tention it wasnt my party any more i retired smiling to a corner of the room while the santa claus helpers began coming in with their sacks of gear on their shoulders it was hohoho little girl and merry christmas everybody until you couldnt hear yourself think lilymary was biting her lip staring at me the santa tapped her on the shoulder wheres the kitchen lady he asked that door okay wynken go on in and get set up nod you go down and hurry up the sound truck then you can handle the door the rest of you helpers he surveyed the room briefly start lining up your christmas goodies there and there now hop to it boys we got four more visits to make this afternoon yet you never saw a crew of christmas gnomes move as fast as them snap and the tree was up complete with its tinsel stars and gray colored order forms and credit application blanks snip and two of the helpers were stringing the red and green lights that led from the hargreave living room to the sound truck outside snipsnap and you could hear the sound truck pealing the joyous strains of all i want for christmas is two of everything in the street and twos and threes of the neighborhood children were beginning to appear at the door blinking and ready for the fun the kitchen helpers were ladling out mugs of cocoa and coloredsugar christmas cookies and collecting the dimes and quarters from the kids the demonstrator helpers were showing the kids the toys and trinkets from their sacks and santa himself was seated on his glittering throne hohoho my boy he was saying and where does your daddy work this merry christmas season i was proud of them there wasnt a helper there who couldnt have walked into saul cappell or any other store in town and walked out a santa with a crew of his own but thats the way we do things at the emporium skilled hands and high paychecks and you only have to look at our sales records to see that it pays off well i wanted to stay and watch the fun but sundays a bad day to take the afternoon off i slipped out and headed back to the store i put in a hard four hours but i made it a point to be down at the special services division when the crews came straggling in for their checkout the crew i was interested in was the last to report naturally isnt that always the way santa was obviously tired i let him shuck his uniform and turn his sales slips in to the cashier before i tackled him how did it go i asked anxiously did miss hargreave i mean the grownup miss hargreave did she say anything he looked at me accusingly you he whined mr martin you shouldnt have run out on us like that how we supposed to keep up a schedule when you throw us that kind of a curve mr martin it was no way for a santa to be talking to a department head but i overlooked it the man was obviously upset what are you talking about i demanded those hargreaves honestly mr martin youd think they didnt want us there the way they acted the kids were bad enough but when the old man came home wow i tell you mr martin i been eleven christmases in the department and i never saw a family with less christmas spirit than those hargreaves the cashier was yelling for the cash receipts so he could lock up his ledgers for the night so i let the santa go but i had plenty to think about as i went back to my own department wondering about what he had said i didnt have to wonder long just before closing one of the office girls waved me in from where i was checking out a new counselor and i answered the phone call it was lilymarys father mad he was blazing i could hardly make sense out of most of what he said it was words like perverting the christian festival and selling out the saviour and a lot of stuff i just couldnt follow at all but the part he finished up with that i could understand i want you to know mr martin he said in clear crisp emphatic tones that you are no longer a welcome caller at our home it pains me to have to say this sir as for lilymary you may consider this her resignation to be effective at once but i said but but i was talking to a dead line he had hung up and that was the end of that personnel called up after a couple of days and wanted to know what to do with lilymarys severance pay i told them to mail her the check then i had a second thought and asked them to send it up to me i mailed it to her myself with a little note apologizing for what id done wrong whatever it was but she didnt even answer october began and the pace stepped up every night i crawled home boneweary turned on my dreamster and slept like a log i gave the machine a real workout i even had the buyer in the sleep shoppe get me rare outofprint tapes on special order last days of petronius arbiter and casanovas diary and the polly adler story and so on until the buyer began to leer when she saw me coming but it didnt do any good while i slept i was surrounded with the loveliest of them all but when i woke the face of lilymary hargreave was in my minds eye october the store was buzzing national c ost of living was up but our rate of sale was up over the previous year the store bosses were beaming and bonuses were in the air for everybody november the tide was at its full and little wavelets began to ebb backward housewares was picked clean and the manufacturers only laughed as we implored them for deliveries but home appliances was as dead as the january lull our overall rate of sale slowed down microscopically but it didnt slow down the press of work it made things tougher in fact because we were pushing twice as hard on the items we could supply coaxing the customers off the ones that were running short bad management no looking at my shipment figures wed actually emptied the store four times in seven weeks better than fifty per cent turnover a week our july purchase estimates had been off only slightly two persons fewer out of each hundred bought airconditioners than we had expected one and a half persons more out of each hundred bought kitchenware saul cappell had been out of kitchenware except for spot deliveries sold the day they arrived ever since late september heinemann called me into his office george he said i just checked your backlog the unifiled order list runs a little over eleven thousand i want to tell you that im surprised at the way you and your department have now mr heinemann i burst out that isnt fair weve been putting in overtime every night every blasted one of us eleven thousands pretty good if you ask me he looked surprised my point exactly george he said i was about to compliment you i felt so high i swallowed uh thanks i said i mean im sorry i forget it george heinemann was looking at me thoughtfully youve got something on your mind dont you well is it that girl girl i stared at him who said anything about a girl come off it he said genially you think it isnt all over the store he glanced at his watch george he said i never interfere in employees private lives you know that but if its that girl thats bothering you why dont you marry her for a while it might be just the thing you need come on now george confess when were you married last three years five years ago i looked away i never was i admitted that jolted him never he studied me thoughtfully for a second you arent no no no i said hastily nothing like that its just that well its always seemed like a pretty big step to take he relaxed again ah you kids he said genially always afraid of getting hurt eh well ill mind my own business if thats the way you want it but if i were you george id go get her that was that i went back to work but i kept right on thinking about what heinemann had said after all why not i called lilymary she faltered and halfturned i had counted on that you could tell she wasnt brought up in this country from the age of six on our girls learn lesson one when youre walking alone at night dont stop she didnt stop long she peered into the doorway and saw me and her expression changed as though i had hit her with a club george she said and hesitated and walked on her hair was a shimmering rainbow in the christmas lights we were only a few doors from her house i glanced halfapprehensive at the door but no father hargreave was there to scowl i followed her and said please lilymary cant we just talk for a moment she faced me why to i swallowed to let me apologize she said gently no apology is necessary george were different breeds of cats no need to apologize for that please well she said and then why not we found a bench in the little park across from the subway entrance it was late enormous halftracks from the sanitation department were emptying trash cans sprinkler trucks came by and we had to raise our feet off the ground she said once i really ought to get back i was only going to the store but she stayed well i apologized and she listened like a lady and like a lady she said again theres nothing to apologize for and that was that and i still hadnt said what i had come for i didnt know how i brooded over the problem with the rumble of the trash trucks and the roar of their burners conversation was difficult enough anyhow but even under those handicaps i caught a phrase from lilymary back to the jungle she was saying its home for us george father cant wait to get back and neither an the girls i interruped her get back she glanced at me thats what i said she nodded at the sanitation workers baling up the enormous drifts of christmas cards thrusting them into the site burners as soon as the mails open up she said and father gets his visa it was mailed a week ago they say they tell me that in the christmas rush it might take two or three weeks more to get to us though something was clogging up my throat all i could say was why lilymary sighed its where we live george she explained this isnt right for us were mission brats and we belong out in the field spreading the good news though father says you people need it more than the dyaks she looked quickly into my eyes i mean i waved it aside i took a deep breath lilymary i said all in a rush will you marry me silence while lilymary looked at me oh george she said after a moment and that was all but i was able to translate it the answer was no still proposing marriage is something like buying a lottery ticket you may not win the grand award but there are consolation prizes mine was a date lilymary stood up to her father and i was allowed in the house i wouldnt say i was welcomed but dr hargreave was polite distant but polite he offered me coffee he spoke of the dream superstitions of the dyaks and old days in the long house and when lilymary was ready to go he shook my hand at the door we had dinner i asked her but as a piece of conversation not a begging plea from the heart i asked her why they had to go back the dyaks she said they were fathers people they needed him alter mothers death father had wanted to come back to america but it was wrong for them he was going back the girls naturally were going with him we danced i kissed her in the shadows when it was growing late she hesitated but she kissed me back i resolved to destroy my dreamster its ersatz ecstasies were pale there she said as she drew back and her voice was gentle with a note of laughter i just wanted to show you it isnt all hymnsinging back on borneo you know i reached out for her again but she drew back and the laughter was gone she glanced at her watch time for me to go george she said we start packing tomorrow but its time to go george she said and she kissed me at her door but she didnt invite me in i stripped the tapes off my dreamster and threw them away but hours later after the fiftieth attempt to get to sleep and the twentieth solitary cigarette i got up and turned on the light and looked for them again they were pale but they were all i had party week the store was nearly bare a messenger from the credit department came staggering in with a load of files just as the closing gong sounded he dropped them on my desk thank god he said fervently guess you wont be bothering with these tonight eh mr martin but i searched through them all the same he looked at me wonderingly but the clerks were breaking out the bottles and the runners from the lunchroom were bringing up sandwiches and he drifted away i found the credit check i had requested comaker required was stamped at the top and triply underlined in red but that wasnt what i was looking for i hunted through the text until i found what i wanted to know subject is expected to leave this country within fortyeight hours subjects employer is organized and incorporated under laws of state of new york as a religious mission group no earnings record on file caution subject would appear a bad credit risk due to i read no farther fortyeight hours there was a scrawl at the bottom of the page in the credit managers own handwriting george what the devil are you up to this is the fourth check we made on these people it was true enough but it would be the last in fortyeight hours they would be gone i was dull at the christmas party but it had been a splendid christmas for the store and in an hour everyone was too drunk to notice i decided to skip party week i stayed at home the next morning staring out the window it had begun to snow and the cleaners were dragging away old christmas trees its always a letdown when christmas is over but my mood had nothing to do with the season only with lilymary and the numbers of miles from her to borneo i circled the date in red on my calendar december th by the th they would be gone but i couldnt repeat couldnt let her go so easily it wasnt that i wanted to try again and be rebuffed again it was not a matter of choice i had to see her nothing else suddenly had any meaning so i made the long subway trek out there knowing it was a fools errand but what kind of an errand could have been more appropriate for me they werent home but i wasnt going to let that stop me i banged on the door of the next apartment and got a surly suspicious whatdoyouwantwiththem inspection from the woman who lived there but she thought they might possibly be down at the community center on the next block and they were the community center was a big yellowbrick recreation hail it had swimming pools and pingpong tables and all kinds of odds and ends to keep the kids off the streets it was that kind of a neighborhood it also had a meeting hall in the basement and there were the hargreaves all of them along with a couple of dozen other people none of them were young except the hargreave girls the hall had a dusty storeroom quality to it as though it wasnt used much and in fact i saw it still had a small christmas tree standing in it whatever else they had they did not have a very efficient cleanup squad i came to the door to the hall and stood there looking around someone was playing a piano and they were having a singing party the music sounded familiar but i couldnt recognize the words adeste fideles laeti triumphantes venite venite in bethlehem the girls were sitting together in the front row their father wasnt with them but i saw why he was standing at a little lectern in the front of the hall natum videte regem angelorum venite adoremus venite adoremus i recognized the tune then it was a slow draggybeat steal from that oldtime favorite christmastree mambo it didnt sound too bad though as they finished with a big major chord from the piano and all fifteen or twenty voices going then hargreave started to talk i didnt listen i was too busy watching the back of lilymarys head ive always had pretty low psi though and she didnt turn around something was bothering me there was a sort of glow from up front i took my eyes off lilymarys blond head and there was dr hargreave radiant i blinked and looked again and it was not so radiant a trick of the light coming through the basement windows onto his own blond hair i suppose but it gave me a curious feeling for a moment i must have moved because he caught sight of me he stumbled over a word but then he went on but that was enough after a moment lilymarys head turned and her eyes met mine she knew i was there i backed away from the door and sat down on the steps coming down from the entrance sooner or later she would be out it wasnt long at all she came toward me with a question in her eye she was all by herself inside the hail her father was still talking i stood up straight and said it all lilymary i said i cant help it i want to marry you ive done everything wrong but i didnt mean to i i dont even want it conditional lilymary i want it for life here or borneo i dont care which i only care about one thing and thats you it was funny i was trying to tell her i loved her and i was standing stiff and awkward talking in about the same tone of voice id use to tell a stock boy he was fired but she understood i probably didnt have to say a word she would have understood anyhow she started to speak and changed her mind and started again and finally got out what would you do in borneo and then so soft that i hardly knew i was hearing it she added dear dear it was like the first time heinemann came in and called me department head i felt nine feet tall i didnt answer her i reached out and i kissed her and it wasnt any wonder that i didnt know we werent alone until i heard her father cough not more than a yard away i jumped but lilymary turned and looked at him perfectly calm you ought to be conducting the service father she scolded him he nodded his big fair head doctor mausner can pronounce the benediction without me he said i should be there but well he has plenty of things to forgive all of us already one more isnt going to bother him now whats this george has asked me to marry him and she looked at me i she began and stopped i said i love her he looked at me too and then he sighed george he said after a moment i dont know whats right and whats wrong for the first time in my life maybe ive been seffish when i asked lilymary to go back with me and the girls i didnt mean it that way but i dont deny i wanted it i dont know but he smiled and it was a big warm smile but theres something i do know i know lilymary and i can trust her to make up her own mind he patted her lightly ill see you after the service he said to me and left us back in the hail through the door he opened i could hear all the voices going at once lets go inside and pray george said lilymary and her whole heart and soul was on her face as she looked at me with love and anxiousness i only hesitated a moment pray but it meant lilymary and that meant well everything so i went in and we were all kneeling and lilymary coached me through the words and i prayed and do you know ive never regretted it
