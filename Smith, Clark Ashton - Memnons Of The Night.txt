the memnons of the night by clark ashton smith ringed with a bronze horizon which at a point immensely remote seems welded with the blue brilliance of a sky of steel they oppose the black splendour of their porphyritic forms to the suns insuperable gaze reared in the morning twilight of primeval time by a race whose towering tombs and cities are one with the dust of their builders in the slow lapse of the desert they abide to face the terrible latter dawns that move abroad in a starkness of fire consuming the veils of night on the vast and sphinxlike desolations level with the light their tenebrific brows preserve a pride as of titan kings in their lidless implacable eyes of staring stone is the petrified despair of those who have gazed too long on the infinite mute as the mountains from whose iron matrix they were hewn their mouths have never acknowledged the sovereignty of the suns that pass in triumphal flame from horizon unto horizon of the prostrate land only at eve when the west is a brazen furnace and the faroff mountains smoulder like ruddy gold in the depth of the heated heavens only at eve when the east grows infinite and vague and the shadows of the waste are one with the increasing shadow of night then and then only from their sullen throats of stone a music rings to the bronze horizon a strong a sombre music strange and sonorous like the singing of black stars or a litany of gods that invoke oblivion a music that thrills the desert to its heart of adamant and trembles in the granite of forgotten tombs till the last echoes of its jubilation terrible as the trumpets of doom are one with the trumpets of infinity
