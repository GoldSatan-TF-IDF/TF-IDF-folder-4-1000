theres nothing to do in pitts landing michael warner said his hands shoved into the pockets of his faded denim cutoffs yeah pitts landing is the pits greg banks said doug arthur and shari walker muttered their agreement pitts landing is the pits that was the town slogan according to greg and his three friends actually pitts landing wasnt much different from a lot of small towns with quiet streets of shady lawns and comfortable old houses but here it was a balmy fall afternoon and the four friends were hanging around gregs driveway kicking at the gravel wondering what to do for fun and excitement lets go to grovers and see if the new comic books have come in doug suggested we dont have any money bird greg told him everyone called doug bird because he looked a lot like a bird a better nickname might have been stork he had long skinny legs and took long storklike steps under his thick tuft of brown hair which he seldom brushed he had small birdlike brown eyes and a long nose that curved like a beak doug didnt really like being called bird but he was used to it we can still look at the comics bird insisted until grover starts yelling at you shari said she puffed out her cheeks and did a pretty good imitation of the gruff store owner are you paying or staying he thinks hes cool greg said laughing at her imitation hes such a jerk i think the new xforce is coming in this week bird said you should join the xforce greg said giving his pal a playful shove you could be bird man youd be great we should all join the xforce michael said if we were superheroes maybe wed have something to do no we wouldnt shari quickly replied theres no crime to fight in pitts landing we could fight crabgrass bird suggested he was the joker in the group the others laughed the four of them had been friends for a long time greg and shari lived next door to each other and their parents were best friends bird and michael lived on the next block how about a baseball game michael suggested we could go down to the playground no way shari said you cant play with only four people she pushed back a strand of her crimped black hair that had fallen over her face shari was wearing an oversized yellow sweatshirt over bright green leggings maybe well find some other kids there michael said picking up a handful of gravel from the drive and letting it sift through his chubby fingers michael had short red hair blue eyes and a face full of freckles he wasnt exactly fat but no one would ever call him skinny come on lets play baseball bird urged i need the practice my little league starts in a couple of days little league in the fall shari asked its a new fall league the first game is tuesday after school bird explained hey well come watch you greg said well come watch you strike out shari added her hobby was teasing bird what position are you playing greg asked backstop michael cracked no one laughed michaels jokes always fell flat bird shrugged probably the outfield how come youre not playing greg with his big shoulders and muscular arms and legs greg was the natural athlete of the group he was blond and goodlooking with flashing graygreen eyes and a wide friendly smile my brother terry was supposed to go sign me up but he forgot greg said making a disgusted face where is terry shari asked she had a tiny crush on gregs older brother he got a job saturdays and after school at the dairy freeze greg told her lets go to the dairy freeze michael exclaimed enthusiastically we dont have any money remember bird said glumly terryll give us free cones michael said turning a hopeful gaze on greg yeah free cones but no ice cream in them greg told him you know what a straightarrow my brother is this is boring shari complained watching a robin hop across the sidewalk its boring standing around talking about how bored we are we could sit down and talk about how bored we are bird suggested twisting his mouth into the goofy halfsmile he always wore when he was making a dumb joke lets take a walk or a jog or something shari insisted she made her way across the lawn and began walking balancing her white hightops on the edge of the curb waving her arms like a highwire performer the boys followed imitating her in an impromptu game of follow the leader all of them balancing on the curb edge as they walked a curious cocker spaniel came bursting out of the neighbors hedge yapping excitedly shari stopped to pet him the dog its stub of a tail wagging furiously licked her hand a few times then the dog lost interest and disappeared back into the hedge the four friends continued down the block playfully trying to knock each other off the curb as they walked they crossed the street and continued on past the school a couple of guys were shooting baskets and some little kids played kickball on the practice baseball diamond but no one they knew the road curved away from the school they followed it past familiar houses then just beyond a small wooded area they stopped and looked up a sloping lawn the grass uncut for weeks tall weeds poking out everywhere the shrubs ragged and overgrown at the top of the lawn nearly hidden in the shadows of enormous old oak trees sprawled a large ramshackle house the house anyone could see had once been grand it was gray shingle three stories tall with a wraparound screened porch a sloping red roof and tall chimneys on either end but the broken windows on the second floor the cracked weatherstained shingles the bare spots on the roof and the shutters hanging loosely beside the dustsmeared windows were evidence of the houses neglect everyone in pitts landing knew it as the coffman house coffman was the name painted on the mailbox that tilted on its broken pole over the front walk but the house had been deserted for years ever since greg and his friends could remember and people liked to tell weird stories about the house ghost stories and wild tales about murders and ghastly things that happened there most likely none of them were true hey i know what we can do for excitement michael said staring up at the house bathed in shadows huh what are you talking about greg asked warily lets go into the coffman house michael said starting to make his way across the weedchoked lawn whoa are you crazy greg called hurrying to catch up to him lets go in michael said his blue eyes catching the light of the late afternoon sun filtering down through the tall oak trees we wanted an adventure something a little exciting right come on lets check it out greg hesitated and stared up at the house a cold chill ran down his back before he could reply a dark form leapt up from the shadows of the tall weeds and attacked him greg toppled backwards onto the ground aah he screamed then he realized the others were laughing its that dumb cocker spaniel shari cried he followed us go home dog go home bird shooed the dog away the dog trotted to the curb turned around and stared back at them its stubby tail wagging furiously feeling embarrassed that hed become so frightened greg slowly pulled himself to his feet expecting his friends to give him grief but they were staring up at the coffman house thoughtfully yeah michaels right bird said slapping michael hard on the back so hard michael winced and turned to slug bird lets see what its like in there no way greg said hanging back i mean the place is kind of creepy dont you think so shari challenged him joining michael and bird who repeated her question so so i dont know greg replied he didnt like being the sensible one of the group everyone always made fun of the sensible one hed rather be the wild and crazy one but somehow he always ended up sensible i dont think we should go in there he said staring up at the neglected old house are you chicken bird asked chicken michael joined in bird began to cluck loudly tucking his hands into his armpits and flapping his arms with his beady eyes and beaky nose he looked just like a chicken greg didnt want to laugh but he couldnt help it bird always made him laugh the clucking and flapping seemed to end the discussion they were standing at the foot of the broken concrete steps that led up to the screened porch look the window next to the front door is broken shari said we can just reach in and open the door this is cool michael said enthusiastically are we really doing this greg being the sensible one had to ask i mean what about spidey spidey was a weirdlooking man of fifty or sixty theyd all seen lurking about town he dressed entirely in black and crept along on long slender legs he looked just like a black spider so the kids all called him spidey most likely he was a homeless guy no one really knew anything about him where hed come from where he lived but a lot of kids had seen him hanging around the coffman house maybe spidey doesnt like visitors greg warned but shari was already reaching in through the broken windowpane to unlock the front door and after little effort she turned the brass knob and the heavy wooden door swung open one by one they stepped into the front entryway greg reluctantly bringing up the rear it was dark inside the house only narrow beams of sunlight managed to trickle down through the heavy trees in front creating pale circles of light on the worn brown carpet at their feet the floorboards squeaked as greg and his friends made their way past the living room which was bare except for a couple of overturned grocery store cartons against one wall spideys furniture greg wondered the living room carpet as threadbare as the one in the entry way had a dark oval stain in the center of it greg and bird stopping in the doorway both noticed it at the same time think its blood bird asked his tiny eyes lighting up with excitement greg felt a chill on the back of his neck probably ketchup he replied bird laughed and slapped him hard on the back shari and michael were exploring the kitchen they were staring at the dustcovered kitchen counter as greg stepped up behind them he saw immediately what had captured their attention two fat gray mice were standing on the countertop staring back at them theyre cute shari said they look just like cartoon mice the sound of her voice made the two rodents scamper along the counter around the sink and out of sight theyre gross michael said making a disgusted face i think they were rats not mice rats have long tails mice dont greg told him they were definitely rats bird muttered pushing past them and into the hallway he disappeared toward the front of the house shari reached up and pulled open a cabinet over the counter empty i guess spidey never uses the kitchen she said well i didnt think he was a gourmet chef greg joked he followed her into the long narrow dining room as bare and dusty as the other rooms a low chandelier still hung from the ceiling so brown with caked dust it was impossible to tell that it was glass looks like a haunted house greg said softly boo shari replied theres not much to see in here greg complained following her back to the dark hallway unless you get a thrill from dustballs suddenly a loud crack made him jump shari laughed and squeezed his shoulder what was that he cried unable to stifle his fear old houses do things like that she said they make noises for no reason at all i think we should leave greg insisted embarrassed again that hed acted so frightened i mean its boring in here its kind of exciting being somewhere were not supposed to be shari said peeking into a dark empty room probably a den or study at one time i guess greg replied uncertainly they bumped into michael wheres bird greg asked i think he went down in the basement michael replied huh the basement michael pointed to an open door at the right of the hallway the stairs are there the three of them made their way to the top of the stairs they peered down into the darkness bird from somewhere deep in the basement his voice floated up to them in a horrified scream help its got me somebody please help its got me its got me its got me at the sound of birds terrified cries greg pushed past shari and michael who stood frozen in openmouthed horror practically flying down the steep stairway greg called out to his friend im coming bird what is it his heart pounding greg stopped at the bottom of the stairs every muscle tight with fear his eyes searched frantically through the smoky light pouring in from the basement windows up near the ceiling bird there he was sitting comfortably calmly on an overturned metal trash can his legs crossed a broad smile on his birdlike face gotcha he said softly and burst out laughing what is it what happened came the frightened voices of shari and michael they clamored down the stairs coming to a stop beside greg it took them only a few seconds to scope out the situation another dumb joke michael asked his voice still trembling with fear bird you were goofing on us again shari asked shaking her head enjoying his moment bird nodded with his peculiar halfgrin you guys are too easy he scoffed but doug shari started she only called him doug when she was upset with him havent you ever heard of the boy who cried wolf what if something bad happens sometime and you really need help and we think youre just goofing what could happen bird replied smugly he stood up and gestured around the basement look its brighter down here than upstairs he was right sunlight from the back yard cascaded down through four long windows at ground level near the ceiling of the basement i still think we should get out of here greg insisted his eyes moving quickly around the large cluttered room behind birds overturned trash can stood an improvised table made out of a sheet of plywood resting on four paint cans a nearly flat mattress dirty and stained rested against the wall a faded wool blanket folded at the foot spidey must live down here michael exclaimed bird kicked his way through a pile of empty food boxes that had been tossed all over the floor tv dinners mostly hey a hungry man dinner he exclaimed where does spidey heat these up maybe he eats them frozen shari suggested you know like popsicles she made her way toward a towering oak wardrobe and pulled open the doors wow this is excellent she declared look she pulled out a rattylooking fur coat and wrapped it around her shoulders excellent she repeated twirling in the old coat from across the room greg could see that the wardrobe was stuffed with old clothing michael and bird hurried to join shari and began pulling out strangelooking pairs of bellbottom pants yellowed dress shirts with pleats down the front tiedyed neckties that were about a foot wide and brightcolored scarves and bandannas hey guys greg warned dont you think maybe those belong to somebody bird spun around a fuzzy red boa wrapped around his neck and shoulders yeah these are spideys dressup clothes he cracked check out this baad hat shari said turning around to show off the bright purple widebrimmed hat she had pulled on neat michael said examining a long blue cape this stuff must be at least twentyfive years old its awesome how could someone just leave it here maybe theyre coming back for it greg suggested as his friends explored the contents of the wardrobe greg wandered to the other end of the large basement a furnace occupied the far wall its ducts covered in thick cobwebs partially hidden by the furnace ducts greg could see stairs probably leading to an outside exit wooden shelves lined the adjoining wall cluttered with old paint cans rags newspapers and rusty tools whoever lived here must have been a real handyman greg thought examining a wooden worktable in front of the shelves a metal vise was clamped to the edge of the worktable greg turned the handle expecting the jaws of the vise to open but to his surprise as he turned the vise handle a door just above the worktable popped open greg pulled the door all the way open revealing a hidden cabinet shelf resting on the shelf was a camera for a long moment greg just stared at the camera something told him the camera was hidden away for a reason something told him he shouldnt touch it he should close the secret door and walk away but he couldnt resist it he reached onto the hidden shelf and took the camera in his hands it pulled out easily then to gregs surprise the door instantly snapped shut with a loud bang weird he thought turning the camera in his hands what a strange place to leave a camera why would someone put it here if it were valuable enough to hide in a secret cabinet why didnt they take it with them greg eagerly examined the camera it was large and surprisingly heavy with a long lens perhaps a telephoto lens he thought greg was very interested in cameras he had an inexpensive automatic camera which took okay snapshots but he was saving his allowance in hopes of buying a really good camera with a lot of lenses he loved looking at camera magazines studying the different models picking out the ones he wanted to buy sometimes he daydreamed about traveling around the world going to amazing places mountaintops and hidden jungle rivers hed take photos of everything he saw and become a famous photographer his camera at home was just too crummy thats why all his pictures came out too dark or too light and everyone in them had glowing red dots in their eyes greg wondered if this camera was any good raising the viewfinder to his eye he sighted around the room he came to a stop on michael who was wearing two bright yellow feather boas and a white stetson hat and had climbed to the top of the steps to pose wait hold it greg cried moving closer raising the camera to his eye let me take your picture michael whered you find that bird asked does that thing have film in it michael demanded i dont know greg said lets see leaning against the railing michael struck what he considered a sophisticated pose greg pointed the camera up and focused carefully it took a short while for his finger to locate the shutter button okay ready say cheese cheddar michael said grinning down at greg as he held his pose against the railing very funny michaels a riot bird said sarcastically greg centered michael in the viewfinder frame then pressed the shutter button the camera clicked and flashed then it made an electronic whirring sound a slot pulled open on the bottom and a cardboard square slid out hey its one of those automaticdeveloping cameras greg exclaimed he pulled the square of cardboard out and examined it look the picture is starting to develop let me see michael called down leaning on the railing but before he could start down the stairs everyone heard a loud crunching sound they all looked up to the source of the sound and saw the railing break away and michael go sailing over the edge noooooo michael screamed as he toppled to the floor arms outstretched the feather boas flying behind him like animal tails he turned in the air then hit the concrete hard on his back his eyes frozen wide in astonishment and fright he bounced once then cried out again my ankle owwww my ankle he grabbed at the injured ankle then quickly let go with a loud gasp it hurt too much to touch it ohhh my ankle still holding the camera and the photo greg rushed to michael shari and bird did the same well go get help shari told michael who was still on his back groaning in pain but then they heard the ceiling creak footsteps above them someone was in the house someone was approaching the basement stairs they were going to be caught the footsteps overhead grew louder the four friends exchanged frightened glances weve got to get out of here shari whispered the ceiling creaked you cant leave me here michael protested he pulled himself to a sitting position quick stand up bird instructed michael struggled to his feet i cant stand on this foot his face revealed his panic well help you shari said turning her eyes to bird ill take one arm you take the other bird obediently moved forward and pulled michaels arm around his shoulder okay lets move shari whispered supporting michael from the other side but how do we get out bird asked breathlessly the footsteps grew louder the ceiling creaked under their weight we cant go up the stairs michael whispered leaning on shari and bird theres another stairway behind the furnace greg told them pointing it leads out michael asked wincing from his ankle pain probably greg led the way just pray the door isnt padlocked or something were praying were praying bird declared were outta here shari said groaning under the weight of michaels arm leaning heavily against shari and bird michael hobbled after greg and they made their way to the stairs behind the furnace the stairs they saw led to wooden double doors up on ground level i dont see a padlock greg said warily please doors be open hey whos down there an angry mans voice called from behind them its its spidey michael stammered hurry shari urged giving greg a frightened push come on greg set the camera down on the top step then he reached up and grabbed the handles of the double doors whos down there spidey sounded closer angrier the doors could be locked from the outside greg whispered hesitating just push them man bird pleaded greg took a deep breath and pushed with all his strength the doors didnt budge were trapped he told them now what michael whined try again bird urged greg maybe theyre just stuck he slid out from under michaels arm here ill help you greg moved over to give bird room to step up beside him ready he asked one two three push both boys pushed against the heavy wooden doors with all their might and the doors swung open okay now were outta here shari declared happily picking up the camera greg led the way out the back yard he saw was as weedchoked and overgrown as the front an enormous limb had fallen off an old oak tree probably during a storm and was lying half in the tree half on the ground somehow bird and shari managed to drag michael up the steps and onto the grass can you walk try it bird said still leaning against the two of them michael reluctantly pushed his foot down on the ground he lifted it then pushed it again hey it feels a little better he said surprised then lets go bird said they ran to the overgrown hedge that edged along the side of the yard michael on his own now stepping gingerly on the bad ankle doing his best to keep up then staying in the shadow of the hedge they made their way around the house to the front all right bird cried happily as they reached the street we made it gasping for breath greg stopped at the curb and turned back toward the house look he cried pointing up to the living room window a dark figure stood in the window hands pressed against the glass its spidey shari said hes just staring at us michael cried weird greg said lets go they didnt stop till they got to michaels house a sprawling redwood ranchstyle house behind a shady front lawn hows the ankle greg asked its loosened up a lot it doesnt even hurt that much michael said man you couldve been killed bird declared wiping sweat off his forehead with the sleeve of his tshirt thanks for reminding me michael said dryly lucky thing youve got all that extra padding bird teased shut up michael muttered well you guys wanted adventure shari said leaning back against the trunk of a tree that guy spidey is definitely weird bird said shaking his head you see the way he was staring at us michael asked all dressed in black and everything he looked like some kind of zombie or something he saw us greg said softly suddenly feeling a chill of dread he saw us very clearly wed better stay away from there what for michael demanded it isnt his house hes just sleeping there we could call the police on him but if hes really crazy or something theres no telling what he might do greg replied thoughtfully aw hes not going to do anything shari said quietly spidey doesnt want trouble he just wants to be left alone yeah michael agreed quickly he didnt want us messing with his stuff thats why he yelled like that and came after us michael was leaning over rubbing his ankle hey wheres my picture he demanded straightening up and turning to greg huh you know the picture you snapped with the camera oh right greg suddenly realized he still had the camera gripped tightly in his hand he set it down carefully on the grass and reached into his back pocket i put it in here when we started to run he explained well did it come out michael demanded the three of them huddled around greg to get a view of the snapshot whoa hold on a minute greg cried staring hard at the small square photo somethings wrong whats going on here the four mends gaped at the photograph in gregs hand their mouths dropping open in surprise the camera had caught michael in midair as he fell through the broken railing to the floor thats impossible shari cried you snapped the picture before i fell michael declared grabbing the photo out of gregs hand so that he could study it close up i remember it you remembered wrong bird said moving to get another look at it over michaels shoulder you were falling man what a great action shot he picked up the camera this is a good camera you stole greg i didnt steal it greg started i mean i didnt realize i wasnt falling michael insisted tilting the picture in his hand studying it from every angle i was posing remember i had a big goofy smile on my face and i was posing i remember the goofy smile bird said handing the camera back to greg do you have any other expression youre not funny bird michael muttered he pocketed the picture weird greg said he glanced at his watch hey ive got to get going he said goodbye to the others and headed for home the afternoon sun was lowering behind a cluster of palm trees casting long shifting shadows over the sidewalk he had promised his mother hed straighten up his room and help with the vacuuming before dinner and now he was late what was that strange car in the drive he wondered jogging across the neighbors lawn toward his house it was a navyblue taurus station wagon brand new dad picked up our new car he realized wow greg stopped to admire it it still had the sticker glued to the door window he pulled open the drivers door leaned in and smelled the vinyl upholstery mmmmmm that newcar smell he inhaled deeply again it smelled so good so fresh and new he closed the door hard appreciating the solid clunk it made as it closed what a great new car he thought excitedly he raised the camera to his eye and took a few steps back off the drive ive got to take a picture of this he thought to remember what the car was like when it was totally new he backed up until he had framed the entire profile of the station wagon in the viewfinder then he pressed the shutter button as before the camera clicked loudly the flash flashed and with an electronic whirr a square undeveloped photo of gray and yellow slid out of the bottom carrying the camera and the snapshot greg ran into the house through the front door im home he called down in a minute and hurried up the carpeted stairs to his room greg is that you your father is home his mother called from downstairs i know be right down sorry im late greg shouted back id better hide the camera he decided if mom or dad see it theyll want to know whose it is and where i got it and i wont be able to answer those questions greg did you see the new car are you coming down his mother called impatiently from the foot of the stairs im coming he yelled his eyes searched frantically for a good hiding place under his bed no his mom might vacuum under there and discover it then greg remembered the secret compartment in his headboard he had discovered the compartment years ago when his parents had bought him a new bedroom set quickly he shoved the camera in peering into the mirror above his dresser he gave his blond hair a quick brush rubbed a black soot smudge off his cheek with one hand then started for the door he stopped at the doorway the snapshot of the car where had he put it it took a few seconds to remember that he had tossed it onto his bed curious about how it came out he turned back to retrieve it oh no he uttered a low cry as he gazed at the snapshot whats going on here greg wondered he brought the photo up close to his face this isnt right he thought how can this be the blue taurus station wagon in the photo was a mess it looked as if it had been in a terrible accident the windshield was shattered metal was twisted and bent the door on the drivers side was caved in the car appeared totaled this is impossible greg uttered aloud greg where are you his mother called were all hungry and youre keeping us waiting sorry he answered unable to take his eyes off the snapshot coming he shoved the photo into his top dresser drawer and made his way downstairs the image of the totaled car burned in his mind just to make sure he crossed the living room and peeked out of the front window to the driveway there stood the station wagon sparkling in the glow of the setting sun shiny and perfect he turned and walked into the dining room where his brother and his parents were already seated the new wagon is awesome dad greg said trying to shake the snapshots image from his thoughts but he kept seeing the twisted metal the cavedin drivers door the shattered windshield after dinner gregs dad announced happily im taking you all for a drive in the new car mmmm this is great chicken mom gregs brother terry said chewing as he talked thanks for the compliment mrs banks said dryly but its veal not chicken greg and his dad burst out laughing terrys face grew bright red well he said still chewing its such excellent veal it tastes as good as chicken i dont know why i bother to cook mrs banks sighed mr banks changed the subject how are things at the dairy freeze he asked we ran out of vanilla this afternoon terry said forking a small potato and shoving it whole into his mouth he chewed it briefly then gulped it down people were annoyed about that i dont think i can go for the ride greg said staring down at his dinner which hed hardly touched i mean why not his father asked well greg searched his mind for a good reason he needed to make one up but his mind was a blank he couldnt tell them the truth that he had taken a snapshot of michael and it showed michael falling then a few seconds later michael had fallen and now he had taken a picture of the new car and the car was wrecked in the photo greg didnt really know what it meant but he was suddenly filled with this powerful feeling of dread of fear of he didnt know what a kind of troubled feeling hed never had before but he couldnt tell them any of that it was too weird too crazy i made plans to go over to michaels he lied staring down at his plate well call him and tell him youll see him tomorrow mr banks said slicing his veal thats no problem well im kind of not feeling very well either greg said whats wrong mrs banks asked with instant concern do you have a temperature i thought you looked a little flushed when you came in no greg replied uncomfortably no temperature i just feel kind of tired not very hungry can i have your chicken i mean veal terry asked eagerly he reached his fork across the table and nabbed the cutlet off gregs plate well a nice ride might make you feel better gregs dad said eyeing greg suspiciously you know some fresh air you can stretch out in the back if you want but dad greg stopped he had used up all the excuses he could think of they would never believe him if he said he needed to stay home and do homework on a saturday night youre coming with us and thats final mr banks said still studying greg closely youve been dying for this new wagon to arrive i really dont understand your problem neither do i greg admitted to himself i dont understand it at all why am i so afraid of riding in the new car just because theres something wrong with that stupid camera im being silly greg thought trying to shake away the feeling of dread that had taken away his appetite okay dad great he said forcing a smile ill come are there any more potatoes terry asked its so easy to drive mr banks said accelerating onto the entry ramp to the freeway it handles like a small car not like a station wagon plenty of room back here dad terry said scooting low in the back seat beside greg raising his knees to the back of the front seat hey look theres a drink holder that pulls out from the dash gregs mother exclaimed thats neat awesome mom terry said sarcastically well we never had a drink holder before mrs banks replied she turned back to the two boys are your seat belts buckled do they work properly yeah theyre okay terry replied they checked them at the showroom before i took the car mr banks said signaling to move into the left lane a truck roared by spitting a cloud of exhaust behind it greg stared out the front window his door window was still covered by the new car sticker mr banks pulled off the freeway onto a nearly empty fourlane highway that curved toward the west the setting sun was a red ball low on the horizon in a charcoalgray sky put the pedal to the metal dad terry urged sitting up and leaning forward lets see what this car can do mr banks obediently pressed his foot on the accelerator the cruising speed seems to be about sixty he said slow down mrs banks scolded you know the speed limit is fiftyfive im just testing it gregs dad said defensively you know making sure the transmission doesnt slip or anything greg stared at the glowing speedometer they were doing seventy now slow down i mean it mrs banks insisted youre acting like a crazy teenager thats me mr banks replied laughing this is awesome he said imitating terry ignoring his wifes pleas to slow down they roared past a couple of small cars in the right lane headlights of cars moving towards them were a bright white blur in the darkening night hey greg youve been awfully quiet his mother said you feeling okay yeah im okay greg said softly he wished his dad would slow down he was doing seventyfive now what do you think greg mr banks asked steering with his left hand as his right hand searched the dashboard wheres the light switch i should turn on my headlights the cars great greg replied trying to sound enthusiastic but he couldnt shake away the fear couldnt get the photo of the mangled car out of his mind wheres that stupid light switch its got to be here somewhere mr banks said as he glanced down at the unfamiliar dashboard the station wagon swerved to the left dad look out for that truck greg screamed horns blared a powerful blast of air swept over the station wagon like a giant ocean wave pushing it to the side mr banks swerved the station wagon to the right the truck rumbled past sorry gregs dad said eyes straight ahead slowing the car to sixty fiftyfive fifty i told you to slow down mrs banks scolded shaking her head we couldve been killed i was trying to find the lights he explained oh here they are on the steering wheel he clicked on the headlights you boys okay mrs banks asked turning to check them out yeah fine terry said sounding a little shaken the truck would have hit his side of the car im okay greg said can we go back now dont you want to keep going mr banks asked unable to hide his disappointment i thought wed keep going to santa clara stop and get some ice cream or something gregs right mrs banks said softly to her husband enough for tonight dear lets turn around the truck didnt come that close mr banks argued but he obediently turned off the highway and they headed for home later safe and sound up in his room greg took the photograph out of his dresser and examined it there was the new station wagon the drivers side caved in the windshield shattered weird he said aloud and placed the photo in the secret compartment in his headboard where he had stashed the camera definitely weird he pulled the camera out of its hiding place and turned it around in his hands ill try it one more time he decided he walked to his dresser and aimed at the mirror above it ill take a picture of myself in the mirror he thought he raised the camera then changed his mind that wont work he realized the flash will reflect back and spoil the photo gripping the camera in one hand he made his way across the hall to terrys room his brother was at his desk typing away on his computer keyboard his face bathed in the blue light of the monitor screen terry can i take your picture greg asked meekly holding up the camera terry typed some more then looked up from the screen hey whered you get the camera uh shari loaned it to me greg told him thinking quickly greg didnt like to lie but he didnt feel like explaining to terry how he and his friends had sneaked into the coffman house and he had made off with the camera so can i take your picture greg asked ill probably break your camera terry joked i think its already broken greg told him thats why i want to test it on you go ahead terry said he stuck out his tongue and crossed his eyes greg snapped the shutter an undeveloped photo slid out of the slot in front thanks see you greg headed to the door hey dont i get to see it terry called after him if it comes out greg said and hurried across the hall to his room he sat down on the edge of the bed holding the photo in his lap he stared at it intently as it developed the yellows filled in first then the reds appeared followed by shades of blue whoa greg muttered as his brothers face came into view theres something definitely wrong here in the photo terrys eyes werent crossed and his tongue wasnt sticking out his expression was grim frightened he looked very upset as the background came into focus greg had another surprise terry wasnt in his room he was outdoors there were trees in the background and a house greg stared at the house it looked so familiar was that the house across the street from the playground he took one more look at terrys frightened expression then he tucked the photo and the camera into his secret headboard compartment and carefully closed it the camera must be broken he decided getting changed for bed it was the best explanation he could come up with lying in bed staring up at the shifting shadows on the ceiling he decided not to think about it anymore a broken camera wasnt worth worrying about tuesday afternoon after school greg hurried to meet shari at the playground to watch birds little league game it was a warm fall afternoon the sun high in a cloudless sky the outfield grass had been freshly mowed and filled the air with its sharp sweet smell greg crossed the grass and squinted into the bright sunlight searching for shari both teams were warming up on the sides of the diamond yelling and laughing the sound of balls popping into gloves competing with their loud voices a few parents and several kids had come to watch some were standing around some sitting in the low bleachers along the first base line greg spotted shari behind the backstop and waved to her did you bring the camera she asked eagerly running over to greet him he held it up excellent she exclaimed grinning she reached for it i think its broken greg said holding on to the camera the photos just dont come out right its hard to explain maybe its not the photos maybe its the photographer shari teased maybe ill take a photo of you getting a knuckle sandwich greg threatened he raised the camera to his eye and pointed it at her snap that and ill take a picture of you eating the camera shari threatened playfully she reached up quickly and pulled the camera from his hand what do you want it for anyway greg asked making a halfhearted attempt to grab it back shari held it away from his outstretched hand i want to take birds picture when he comes to bat he looks just like an ostrich at the plate i heard that bird appeared beside them pretending to be insulted he looked ridiculous in his starched white uniform the shirt was too big and the pants were too short the cap was the only thing that fit it was blue with a silver dolphin over the bill and the words pitts landing dolphins what kind of name is dolphins for a baseball team greg asked grabbing the bill and turning the cap backwards on birds head all the other caps were taken bird answered we had a choice between the zephyrs and the dolphins none of us knew what zephyrs were so we picked dolphins shari eyed him up and down maybe you guys should play in your street clothes thanks for the encouragement bird replied he spotted the camera and took it from her hey you brought the camera does it have film yeah i think so greg told him let me see he reached for the camera but bird swung it out of his grasp hey are you going to share this thing greg he asked huh what do you mean greg reached again for the camera and again bird swung it away from him i mean we all risked our lives down in that basement getting it right bird said we should all share it well greg hadnt thought about it i guess youre right bird but im the one who found it so shari grabbed the camera out of birds hand i told greg to bring it so we could take your picture when youre up as an example of good form bird asked as a bad example shari said you guys are just jealous bird replied frowning because im a natural athlete and you cant cross the street without falling on your face he turned the cap back around to face the front hey bird get back here one of the coaches called from the playing field ive got to go bird said giving them a quick wave and starting to trot back to his teammates no wait let me take a fast picture now greg said bird stopped turned around and struck a pose no ill take it shari insisted she started to raise the camera to her eye pointing it toward bird and as she raised it greg grabbed for it let me take it and the camera went off clicked and then flashed an undeveloped photo slid out hey whyd you do that shari asked angrily sorry greg said i didnt mean to she pulled the photo out and held it in her hand greg and bird came close to watch it develop what the heck is that bird cried staring hard at the small square as the colors brightened and took shape oh wow greg cried the photo showed bird sprawled unconscious on his back on the ground his mouth twisted open his neck bent at a frightening angle his eyes shut tight hey whats with this stupid camera bird asked grabbing the snapshot out of snarls hand he tilted it from side to side squinting at it its out of focus or something weird greg said shaking his head hey bird get over here the dolphins coach called coming bird handed the picture back to shari and jogged over to his teammates whistles blew the two teams stopped their practicing and trotted to the benches along the third base line how did this happen shari asked greg shielding her eyes from the sun with one hand holding the photo close to her face with the other it really looks like bird is lying on the ground knocked out or something but he was standing right in front of us i dont get it i really dont greg replied thoughtfully the camera keeps doing that carrying the camera at his side swinging it by its slender strap he followed her to a shady spot beside the bleachers look how his neck is bent shari continued its so awful theres something definitely wrong with the camera greg said he started to tell her about the snapshot he took of the new station wagon and the snapshot of his brother terry but she interrupted him before he could get the words out and that picture of michael it showed him falling down the stairs before he even fell its just so strange i know greg agreed let me see that thing shari said and pulled the camera from his hand is there any film left i cant tell greg admitted i couldnt find a film counter or anything shari examined the camera closely rolling it over in her hands it doesnt say anywhere how can you tell if its loaded or not greg shrugged the baseball game got under way the dolphins were the visiting team the other team the cardinals jogged out to take their positions on the field a kid in the bleachers dropped his soda can it hit the ground and spilled and the kid started to cry an old station wagon filled with teenagers cruised by its radio blaring its horn honking where do you put the film in shari asked impatiently greg stepped closer to help her examine it here i think he said pointing doesnt the back come off shari fiddled with it no i dont think so most of these automaticdeveloping cameras load in the front she pulled at the back but the camera wouldnt open she tried pulling off the bottom no better luck turning the camera she tried pulling off the lens it wouldnt budge greg took the camera from her theres no slot or opening in the front well what kind of camera is it anyway shari demanded uh lets see greg studied the front examined the top of the lens then turned the camera over and studied the back he stared up at her with a surprised look on his face theres no brand name nothing how can a camera not have a name shari shouted in exasperation she snatched the camera away from him and examined it closely squinting her eyes against the bright afternoon sunshine finally she handed the camera back to him defeated youre right greg no name no words of any kind nothing what a stupid camera she added angrily whoa hold on greg told her its not my camera remember i didnt buy it i took it from the coffman house well lets at least figure out how to open it up and look inside shari said the first dolphin batter popped up to the second baseman the second batter struck out on three straight swings the dozen or so spectators shouted encouragement to their team the little kid who had dropped his soda continued to cry three kids rode by on bikes waving to friends on the teams but not stopping to watch ive tried and tried but i cant figure out how to open it greg admitted give me it shari said and grabbed the camera away from him there has to be a button or something there has to be some way of opening it this is ridiculous when she couldnt find a button or lever of any kind she tried pulling the back off once again prying it with her fingernails then she tried turning the lens but it wouldnt turn im not giving up she said gritting her teeth im not this camera has to open it has to give up youre going to wreck it greg warned reaching for it wreck it how could i wreck it shari demanded it has no moving parts nothing this is impossible greg said making a disgusted face she handed the camera to him okay i give up check it out yourself greg he took the camera started to raise it to his face then stopped uttering a low cry of surprise his mouth dropped open and his eyes gaped straight ahead startled shari turned to follow his shocked gaze oh no there on the ground a few yards outside the first base line lay bird he was sprawled on his back his neck bent at an odd and unnatural angle his eyes shut tight bird shari cried gregs breath caught in his throat he felt as if he were choking oh he finally managed to cry out in a shrill raspy voice bird didnt move shari and greg running side by side at full speed reached him together bird shari knelt down beside him bird bird opened one eye gotcha he said quietly the weird halfsmile formed on his face and he exploded in highpitched laughter it took shari and greg a while to react they both stood openmouthed gaping at their laughing friend then his heart beginning to slow to normal greg reached down grabbed bird with both hands and pulled him roughly to his feet ill hold him while you hit him greg offered holding bird from behind hey wait bird protested struggling to squirm out of gregs grasp good plan shari said grinning ow hey let go come on let go bird protested trying unsuccessfully to wrestle free come on whats your problem it was a joke guys very funny shari said giving bird a playful punch on the shoulder youre a riot bird bird finally freed himself with a hard tug and danced away from both of them i just wanted to show you how bogus it is to get all worked up about that dumb camera but bird greg started its just broken thats all bird said brushing blades of recently cut grass off his uniform pants you think because it showed michael falling down those stairs theres something strange with it but thats dumb real dumb i know it greg replied sharply but how do you explain it i told you man its wrecked broken thats it bird get over here a voice called and birds fielders glove came flying at his head he caught it waved with a grin to shari and greg and jogged to the outfield along with the other members of the dolphins carrying the camera tightly in one hand greg led the way to the bleachers he and shari sat down on the end of the bottom bench some of the spectators had lost interest in the game already and had left a few kids had taken a baseball off the field and were having their own game of catch behind the bleachers across the playground four or five kids were getting a game of kickball started bird is such a dork greg said his eyes on the game he scared me to death shari exclaimed i really thought he was hurt what a clown greg muttered they watched the game in silence for a while it wasnt terribly interesting the dolphins were losing going into the third inning none of the players were very good greg laughed as a cardinal batter a kid from their class named joe garden slugged a ball that sailed out to the field and right over birds head thats the third ball that flew over his head greg cried guess he lost it in the sun shari exclaimed joining in the laughter they both watched birds long legs storking after the ball by the time he managed to catch up with it and heave it towards the diamond joe garden had already rounded the bases and scored there were loud boos from the bleachers the next cardinal batter stepped to the plate a few more kids climbed down from the bleachers having seen enough its so hot here in the sun shari said shielding her eyes with one hand and ive got lots of homework want to leave i just want to see the next inning greg said watching the batter swing and miss bird is coming up next inning i want to stay and boo him what are friends for shari said sarcastically it took a long while for the dolphins to get the third out the cardinals batted around their entire order gregs tshirt was drenched with sweat by the time bird came to the plate in the top of the fourth despite the loud booing from shari and greg bird managed to punch the ball past the shortstop for a single lucky hit greg yelled cupping his hands into a megaphone bird pretended not to hear him he tossed away his batters helmet adjusted his cap and took a short lead off first base the next batter swung at the first pitch and fouled it off lets go shari urged pulling gregs arm its too hot im dying of thirst lets just see if bird greg didnt finish his sentence the batter hit the next ball hard it made a loud thunk as it left the bat a dozen people players and spectators cried out as the ball flew across the diamond a sharp line drive and slammed into the side of birds head with another thunk greg watched in horror as the ball bounced off bird and dribbled away onto the infield grass birds eyes went wide with disbelief confusion he stood frozen in place on the base path for a long moment then both of his hands shot up above his head and he uttered a shrill cry long and loud like the highpitched whinny of a horse his eyes rolled up in his head he sank to his knees uttered another cry softer this time then collapsed sprawling onto his back his neck at an unnatural angle his eyes closed he didnt move in seconds the two coaches and both teams were running out to the fallen player huddling over him forming a tight hushed circle around him crying bird bird shari leapt off the bleachers and began running to the circle of horrified onlookers greg started to follow but stopped when he saw a familiar figure crossing the street at a full run waving to him terry greg cried why was his brother coming to the playground why wasnt he at his afterschool job at the dairy freeze terry whats happening greg cried terry stopped gasping for breath sweat pouring down his bright red forehead i ran all the way he managed to utter terry whats wrong a sick feeling crept up from gregs stomach as terry approached his face held the same frightened expression as in the photograph greg had snapped of him the same frightened expression with the same house behind him across the street the snapshot had come true just as the snapshot of bird lying on the ground had come true gregs throat suddenly felt as dry as cotton he realized that his knees were trembling terry what is it he managed to cry its dad terry said putting a heavy hand on gregs shoulder huh dad youve got to come home greg dad hes been in a bad accident an accident gregs head spun terrys words werent making any sense to him in the new car terry explained again placing a heavy hand on gregs trembling shoulder the new car is totaled completely totaled oh greg gasped feeling weak terry squeezed his shoulder come on hurry holding the camera tightly in one hand greg began running after his brother reaching the street he turned back to the playground to see what was happening with bird a large crowd was still huddled around bird blocking him from sight but what was that dark shadow behind the bleachers greg wondered someone someone all in black was hiding back there watching greg come on terry urged greg stared hard at the bleachers the dark figure pulled back out of sight come on greg im coming greg shouted and followed his brother toward home the hospital walls were pale green the uniforms worn by the nurses scurrying through the brightly lit corridors were white the floor tiles beneath gregs feet as he hurried with his brother towards their fathers room were dark brown with orange specks colors all greg could see were blurs of colors indistinct shapes his sneakers thudded noisily against the hard tile floor he could barely hear them over the pounding of his heart totaled the car had been totaled just like in the snapshot greg and terry turned a corner the walls in this corridor were pale yellow terrys cheeks were red two doctors passed by wearing limegreen surgical gowns colors only colors greg blinked tried to see clearly but it was all passing by too fast all too unreal even the sharp hospital smell that unique aroma of rubbing alcohol stale food and disinfectant couldnt make it real for him then the two brothers entered their fathers room and it all became real the colors faded the images became sharp and clear their mother jumped up from the folding chair beside the bed hi boys she clenched a waddedup tissue in her hand it was obvious that she had been crying she forced a tight smile on her face but her eyes were redrimmed her cheeks pale and puffy stopping just inside the doorway of the small room greg returned his mothers greeting in a soft choked voice then his eyes focusing clearly now turned to his father mr banks had a mummylike bandage covering his hair one arm was in a cast the other lay at his side and had a tube attached just below the wrist dripping a dark liquid into the arm the bedsheet was pulled up to his chest hey hows it going guys their father asked his voice sounded fogged in as if coming from far away dad terry started hes going to be okay mrs banks interrupted seeing the frightened looks on her sons faces i feel great mr banks said groggily you dont look so great greg blurted out stepping up cautiously to the bed im okay really their father insisted a few broken bones thats it he sighed then winced from some pain i guess im lucky youre very lucky mrs banks agreed quickly whats the lucky part greg wondered silently to himself he couldnt take his eyes off the tube stuck into his fathers arm again he thought of the snapshot of the car it was up in his room at home tucked into the secret compartment in his headboard the snapshot showing the car totaled the drivers side caved in should he tell them about it he couldnt decide would they believe him if he did tell them whatd you break dad terry asked sitting down on the radiator in front of the windowsill shoving his hands into his jeans pockets your father broke his arm and a few ribs mrs banks answered quickly and he had a slight concussion the doctors are watching him for internal injuries but so far so good i was lucky mr banks repeated he smiled at greg dad i have to tell you about this photo i took greg said suddenly speaking rapidly his voice trembling with nervousness i took a picture of the new car and the car is completely wrecked mrs banks interrupted sitting on the edge of the folding chair she rubbed her fingers working her wedding ring round and around something she always did when she was nervous im glad you boys didnt see it her voice caught in her throat then she added its a miracle he wasnt hurt any worse this photo greg started again later his mother said brusquely okay she gave him a meaningful stare greg felt his face grow hot this is important he thought then he decided they probably wouldnt believe him anyway who would believe such a crazy story will we be able to get another new car terry asked mr banks nodded carefully i have to call the insurance company he said ill call them when i get home mrs banks said you dont exactly have a hand free everyone laughed at that nervous laughter i feel kind of sleepy mr banks said his eyes were halfway closed his voice muffled its the painkillers the doctors gave you mrs banks told him she leaned forward and patted his hand get some sleep ill come back in a few hours she stood up still fiddling with her wedding band and motioned with her head toward the door bye dad greg and terry said in unison their father muttered a reply they followed their mother out the door what happened terry asked as they made their way past a nurses station then down the long pale yellow corridor i mean the accident some guy ran right through a red light mrs banks said her redrimmed eyes straight ahead he plowed right into your fathers side of the car said his brakes werent working she shook her head tears forming in the corners of her eyes i dont know she said sighing i just dont know what to say thank goodness hes going to be okay they turned into the green corridor walking side by side several people were waiting patiently for the elevator at the far end of the hall once again greg found himself thinking of the snapshots he had taken with the weird camera first michael then terry then bird then his father all four photos had shown something terrible something terrible that hadnt happened yet and then all four photos had come true greg felt a chill as the elevator doors opened and the small crowd of people moved forward to squeeze inside what was the truth about the camera he wondered does the camera show the future or does it actually cause bad things to happen yeah i know birds okay greg said into the phone receiver i saw him yesterday remember he was lucky real lucky he didnt have a concussion or anything on the other end of the line in the house next door shari agreed then repeated her request no shari i really dont want to greg replied vehemently bring it shari demanded its my birthday i dont want to bring the camera its not a good idea really greg told her it was the next weekend saturday afternoon greg had been nearly out the door on his way next door to sharis birthday party when the phone rang hi greg why arent you on your way to my party shari had asked when hed run to pick up the receiver because im on the phone with you greg had replied dryly well bring the camera okay greg hadnt looked at the camera hadnt removed it from its hiding place since his fathers accident i dont want to bring it he insisted despite sharis highpitched demands dont you understand shari i dont want anyone else to get hurt oh greg she said talking to him as if he were a threeyearold you dont really believe that do you you dont really believe that camera can hurt people greg was silent for a moment i dont know what i believe he said finally i only know that first michael then bird greg swallowed hard and i had a dream shari last night huh what kind of dream shari asked impatiently it was about the camera i was taking everyones picture my whole family mom dad and terry they were barbecuing in the back yard i held up the camera i kept saying say cheese say cheese over and over and when i looked through the viewfinder they were smiling back at me but they were skeletons all of them their skin was gone and and gregs voice trailed off what a dumb dream shari said laughing but thats why i dont want to bring the camera greg insisted i think bring it greg she interrupted its not your camera you know all four of us were in the coffman house it belongs to all four of us bring it but why shari greg demanded itll be a goof thats all it takes such weird pictures thats for sure greg muttered we dont have anything else to do for my party shari told him i wanted to rent a video but my mom says we have to go outdoors she doesnt want her precious house messed up so i thought we could take everyones picture with the weird camera you know see what strange things come out shari i really dont bring it she ordered and hung up greg stood for a long time staring at the phone receiver thinking hard trying to decide what to do then he replaced the receiver and headed reluctantly up to his room with a loud sigh he pulled the camera from its hiding place in his headboard its sharis birthday after all he said aloud to himself his hands were trembling as he picked it up he realized he was afraid of it i shouldnt be doing this he thought feeling a heavy knot of dread in the pit of his stomach i know i shouldnt be doing this hows it going bird greg called making his way across the flagstone patio to sharis back yard im feeling okay bird said slapping his friend a high five the only problem is ever since that ball hit me bird continued frowning from time to time i start pluuccck cluuuck cluuuuck clucking like a chicken he flapped his arms and started strutting across the back yard clucking at the top of his voice hey bird go lay an egg someone yelled and everyone laughed birds at it again michael said shaking his head he gave greg a friendly punch on the shoulder michael his red hair unbrushed as usual was wearing faded jeans and a flowered hawaiian sports shirt about three sizes too big for him whered you get that shirt greg asked holding michael at arms length by the shoulders to admire it in a cereal box bird chimed in still flapping his arms my grandmother gave it to me michael said frowning he made it in home ec bird interrupted one joke was never enough but why did you wear it greg asked michael shrugged everything else was dirty bird bent down picked up a small clump of dirt from the lawn and rubbed it on the back of michaels shirt now this ones dirty too he declared hey you michael reacted with playful anger grabbing bird and shoving him into the hedge did you bring it hearing sharis voice greg turned towards the house and saw her jogging across the patio in his direction her black hair was pulled back in a single braid and she had on an oversized silky yellow top that came down over black spandex leggings did you bring it she repeated eagerly a charm bracelet filled with tiny silver charms a birthday present jangled at her wrist yeah greg reluctantly held up the camera excellent she declared i really dont want greg started you can take my picture first since its my birthday shari interrupted here hows this she struck a sophisticated pose leaning against a tree with her hand behind her head greg obediently raised the camera are you sure you want me to do this shari yeah come on i want to take everyones picture but itll probably come out weird greg protested i know shari replied impatiently holding her pose thats the fun of it but shari michael puked on his shirt he heard bird telling someone near the hedge i did not michael was screaming you mean it looks like that naturally bird asked greg could hear a lot of raucous laughing all of it at michaels expense will you take the picture shari cried holding on to the slender trunk of the tree greg pointed the lens at her and pressed the button the camera whirred and the undeveloped white square rolled out hey are we the only boys invited michael asked stepping up to shari yeah just you three shari said and nine girls oh wow michael made a face take michaels picture next shari told greg no way michael replied quickly raising his hands as if to shield himself and backing away the last time you took my picture with that thing i fell down the stairs trying to get away michael backed right into nina blake one of sharis friends she reacted with a squeal of surprise then gave him a playful shove and he kept right on backing away michael come on its my party shari called what are we going to do is this it nina demanded from halfway across the yard i thought wed take everyones picture and then play a game or something shari told her a game bird chimed in you mean like spin the bottle a few kids laughed truth or dare nina suggested yeah truth or dare a couple of other girls called in agreement oh no greg groaned quietly to himself truth or dare meant a lot of kissing and awkward embarrassing stunts nine girls and only three boys it was going to be really embarrassing how could shari do this to us he wondered well did it come out shari asked grabbing his arm let me see greg was so upset about having to play truth or dare he had forgotten about the snapshot developing in his hand he held it up and they both examined it where am i shari asked in surprise what were you aiming at you missed me huh greg stared at the snapshot there was the tree but no shari weird i pointed it right at you i lined it up carefully he protested well you missed me im not in the shot shari replied disgustedly but shari i mean come on im not invisible greg im not a vampire or something i can see my reflection in mirrors and i do usually show up in photos but look greg stared hard at the photograph theres the tree you were leaning against you can see the tree trunk clearly and theres the spot where you were standing but where am i shari demanded jangling her charm bracelet noisily never mind she grabbed the snapshot from him and tossed it on the grass take another one quick well okay but greg was still puzzling over the photo why hadnt shari shown up in it he bent down picked it up and shoved it into his pocket stand closer this time she instructed greg moved a few steps closer carefully centered shari in the viewfinder and snapped the picture a square of film zipped out the front shari walked over and pulled the picture from the camera this one better turn out she said staring hard at it as the colors began to darken and take form if you really want pictures of everyone we should get another camera greg said his eyes also locked on the snapshot hey i dont believe it shari cried again she was invisible the tree photographed clearly in perfect focus but shari was nowhere to be seen you were right the dumb camera is broken she said disgustedly handing the photo to greg forget it she turned away from him and called to the others hey guys truth or dare there were some cheers and some groans shari headed them back to the woods behind her back yard to play more privacy she explained there was a circular clearing just beyond the trees a perfect private place the game was just as embarrassing as greg had imagined among the boys only bird seemed to be enjoying it bird loves dumb stuff like this greg thought with some envy luckily after little more than half an hour he heard mrs walker sharis mom calling from the house summoning them back to cut the birthday cake aw too bad greg said sarcastically just when the game was getting good we have to get out of the woods anyway bird said grinning michaels shirt is scaring the squirrels laughing and talking about the game the kids made their way back to the patio where the pinkandwhite birthday cake candles all lit was waiting on the round umbrella table i must be a pretty bad mom mrs walker joked allowing you all to go off into the woods by yourselves some of the girls laughed cake knife in her hand mrs walker looked around wheres shari everyone turned their eyes to search the back yard she was with us in the woods nina told mrs walker just a minute ago hey shari bird called cupping his hands to his mouth as a megaphone earth calling shari its cake time no reply no sign of her did she go in the house greg asked mrs walker shook her head no she didnt come by the patio is she still in the woods ill go check bird told her calling sharis name he ran to the edge of the trees at the back of the yard then he disappeared into the trees still calling a few minutes later bird emerged signaling to the others with a shrug no sign of her they searched the house the front yard the woods again but shari had vanished greg sat in the shade with his back against the tree trunk the camera on the ground at his side and watched the blueuniformed policemen they covered the back yard and could be seen bending low as they climbed around in the woods he could hear their voices but couldnt make out what they were saying their faces were intent bewildered more policemen arrived grimfaced businesslike and then even more darkuniformed policemen mrs walker had called her husband home from a golf game they sat huddled together on canvas chairs in a corner of the patio they whispered to each other their eyes darting across the yard holding hands they looked pale and worried everyone else had left on the patio the table was still set the birthday candles had burned all the way down the blue and red wax melting in hard puddles on the pinkandwhite icing the cake untouched no sign of her a redcheeked policeman with a whiteblond mustache was telling the walkers he pulled off his cap and scratched his head revealing short blond hair did someone take her away mr walker asked still holding his wifes hand no sign of a struggle the policeman said no sign of anything really mrs walker sighed loudly and lowered her head i just dont understand it there was a long painful silence well keep looking the policeman said im sure well find something he turned and headed toward the woods oh hi he stopped in front of greg staring down at him as if seeing him for the first time you still here son all the other guests have gone home he pushed his hair back and replaced his cap yeah i know greg replied solemnly lifting the camera into his lap im officer riddick he said yeah i know greg repeated softly how come you didnt go home after we talked with you like the others riddick asked im just upset i guess greg told him i mean sharis a good friend you know he cleared his throat which felt dry and tight besides i live right over there he gestured with his head to his house next door well you might as well go home son riddick said turning his eyes to the woods with a frown this search could take a long time we havent found a thing back there yet i know greg replied rubbing his hand against the back of the camera and i know that this camera is the reason shari is missing he thought feeling miserable and frightened one minute she was there the next minute she was gone the policeman said studying gregs face as if looking for answers there yeah greg replied its so weird its weirder than anyone knows greg thought the camera made her invisible the camera did it first she vanished from the snapshot then she vanished in real life the camera did it to her i dont know how but it did do you have something more to tell me riddick asked hands resting on his hips his right hand just above the worn brown holster that carried his pistol did you see something something that might give us a clue help us out something you didnt remember to tell me before should i tell him greg wondered if i tell him about the camera hell ask where i got it and ill have to tell him that i got it in the coffman house and well all get in trouble for breaking in there but big deal shari is missing gone vanished thats a lot more important i should tell him greg decided but then he hesitated if i tell him he wont believe me if i tell him how will it help bring shari back you look very troubled riddick said squatting down next to greg in the shade whats your name again greg greg banks well you look very troubled greg the policeman repeated softly why dont you tell me whats bothering you why dont you tell me whats on your mind i think itll make you feel a lot better greg took a deep breath and glanced up to the patio mrs walker had covered her face with her hands her husband was leaning over her trying to comfort her well greg started go ahead son riddick urged softly do you know where shari is its this camera greg blurted out he could suddenly feel the blood throbbing against his temples he took a deep breath and then continued you see this camera is weird what do you mean riddick asked quietly greg took another deep breath i took sharis picture before when i first arrived i took two pictures and she was invisible in both of them see riddick closed his eyes then opened them no i dont understand shari was invisible in the picture everything else was there but she wasnt she had vanished see and then later she vanished for real the camera it predicts the future i guess or it makes bad things happen greg raised the camera attempting to hand it to the policeman riddick made no attempt to take it he just stared hard at greg his eyes narrowing his expression hardening greg felt a sudden stab of fear oh no he thought why is he looking at me like that what is he going to do greg continued to hold the camera out to the policeman but riddick quickly climbed to his feet the camera makes bad things happen his eyes burned into gregs yes greg told him it isnt my camera see and every time i take a picture son thats enough riddick said gently he reached down and rested a hand on gregs trembling shoulder i think youre very upset greg he said his voice almost a whisper i dont blame you this is very upsetting for everyone but its true greg started to insist im going to ask that officer over there riddick said pointing to take you home now and im going to have him tell your parents that youve been through a very frightening experience i knew he wouldnt believe me greg thought angrily how could i have been so stupid now he thinks im some kind of a nut case riddick called to a policeman at the side of the house near the hedge no thats okay greg said quickly pulling himself up cradling the camera in his hand i can make it home okay riddick eyed him suspiciously you sure yeah i can walk by myself if you have anything to tell me later riddick said lowering his gaze to the camera just call the station okay okay greg replied walking slowly towards the front of the house dont worry greg well do our best riddick called after him well find her put the camera away and try to get some rest okay okay greg muttered he hurried past the walkers who were still huddled together under the umbrella on the patio why was i so stupid he asked himself as he walked home why did i expect that policeman to believe such a weird story im not even sure i believe it myself a few minutes later he pulled open the back screen door and entered his kitchen anybody home no reply he headed through the back hall towards the living room anyone home no one terry was at work his mother must have been visiting his dad at the hospital greg felt bad he really didnt feel like being alone now he really wanted to tell them about what had happened to shari he really wanted to talk to them still cradling the camera he climbed the stairs to his room he stopped in the doorway blinked twice then uttered a cry of horror his books were scattered all over the floor the covers had been pulled off his bed his desk drawers were all open their contents strewn around the room the desk lamp was on its side on the floor all of his clothes had been pulled from the dresser and his closet and tossed everywhere someone had been in gregs room and had turned it upside down who would do this greg asked himself staring in horror at his ransacked room who would tear my room apart like this he realized that he knew the answer he knew who would do it who had done it someone looking for the camera someone desperate to get the camera back spidey the creepy guy who dressed all in black was living in the coffman house was he the owner of the camera yes greg knew spidey had done it spidey had been watching greg spying on greg from behind the bleachers at the little league game he knew that greg had his camera and he knew where greg lived that thought was the most chilling of all he knew where greg lived greg turned away from the chaos in his room leaned against the wall of the hallway and closed his eyes he pictured spidey the dark figure creeping along so evilly on his spindly legs he pictured him inside the house gregs house inside gregs room he was here thought greg he pawed through all my things he wrecked my room greg stepped back into his room he felt all mixed up he felt like shouting angrily and crying for help all at once but he was all alone no one to hear him no one to help him what now he wondered what now suddenly leaning against the doorframe staring at his ransacked room he knew what he had to do hey bird its me greg held the receiver in one hand and wiped the sweat off his forehead with the other hed never worked so hard or so fast in all his life did they find shari bird asked eagerly i havent heard i dont think so greg said his eyes surveying his room almost back to normal he had put everything back cleaned and straightened his parents would never guess listen bird im not calling about that greg said speaking rapidly into the phone call michael for me okay meet me at the playground by the baseball diamond when now bird asked sounding confused yeah greg told him we have to meet its important its almost dinnertime bird protested i dont know if my parents its important greg repeated impatiently ive got to see you guys okay well maybe i can sneak out for a few minutes bird said lowering his voice and then greg heard him shout to his mother its no one ma im talking to no one boy thats quick thinking greg thought sarcastically hes a worse liar than i am and then he heard bird call to his mom i know im on the phone but im not talking to anyone its only greg thanks a lot pal greg thought i gotta go bird said get michael okay greg urged yeah okay see you he hung up greg replaced the receiver then listened for his mother silence downstairs she still wasnt home she didnt know about shari greg realized he knew she and his dad were going to be very upset very upset almost as upset as he was thinking about his missing friend he went to his bedroom window and looked down on her yard next door it was deserted now the policemen had all left sharis shaken parents must have gone inside a squirrel sat under the wide shade of the big tree gnawing furiously at an acorn another acorn at his feet in the corner of the window greg could see the birthday cake still sitting forlornly on the deserted table the places all set the decorations still standing a birthday party for ghosts greg shuddered shari is alive he said aloud theyll find her shes alive he knew what he had to do now forcing himself away from the window he hurried to meet his two friends no way bird said heatedly leaning against the bleacher bench have you gone totally bananas swinging the camera by its cord greg turned hopefully to michael but michael avoided gregs stare im with bird he said his eyes on the camera since it was just about dinnertime the playground was nearly deserted a few little kids were on the swings at the other end two kids were riding their bikes round and around the soccer field i thought maybe you guys would come with me greg said disappointed he kicked up a clump of grass with his sneaker i have to return this thing he continued raising the camera i know its what i have to do i have to put it back where i found it no way bird repeated shaking his head im not going back to the coffman house once was enough chicken greg asked angrily yeah bird quickly admitted you dont have to take it back michael argued he pulled himself up the side of the bleachers climbed onto the third deck of seats then lowered himself to the ground what do you mean greg asked impatiently kicking at the grass just toss it greg michael urged making a throwing motion with one hand heave it throw it in the trash somewhere yeah or leave it right here bird suggested he reached for the camera give it to me ill hide it under the seats you dont understand greg said swinging the camera out of birds reach throwing it away wont do any good why not bird asked making another swipe for the camera spideyll just come back for it greg told him heatedly hell come back to my room looking for it hell come after me i know it but what if we get caught taking it back michael asked yeah what if spideys there in the coffman house and he catches us bird said you dont understand greg cried he knows where i live he was in my house he was in my room he wants his camera back and here give it to me bird said we dont have to go back to that house he can find it right here he grabbed again for the camera greg held tightly to the strap and tried to tug it away but bird grabbed the side of the camera no greg cried out as it flashed and whirred a square of film slid out no greg cried to bird horrified staring at the white square as it started to develop you took my picture his hand trembling he pulled the snapshot from the camera what would it show sorry bird said i didnt mean to before he could finish his sentence a voice interrupted from behind the bleachers hey whatve you got there greg looked up from the developing snapshot in surprise two toughlooking boys stepped out of the shadows their expressions hard their eyes on the camera he recognized them immediately joey ferris and mickey ward two ninthgraders who hung out together always swaggering around acting tough picking on kids younger than them their specialty was taking kids bikes riding off on them and dumping them somewhere there was a rumor around school that mickey had once beaten up a kid so badly that the kid was crippled for life but greg believed mickey made up that rumor and spread it himself both boys were big for their age neither of them did very well in school and even though they were always stealing bikes and skateboards and terrorizing little kids and getting into fights neither of them ever seemed to get into serious trouble joey had short blond hair slicked straight up and wore a diamondlike stud in one ear mickey had a round red face full of pimples stringy black hair down to his shoulders and was working a toothpick between his teeth both boys were wearing heavy metal tshirts and jeans hey ive gotta get home bird said quickly halfstepping halfdancing away from the bleachers me too michael said unable to keep the fear from showing on his face greg tucked the snapshot into his jeans pocket hey you found my camera joey said grabbing it out of gregs hand his small gray eyes burned into gregs as if searching for a reaction thanks man give it back joey greg said with a sigh yeah dont take that camera mickey told his friend a smile spreading over his round face its mine he wrestled the camera away from joey give it back greg insisted angrily reaching out his hand then he softened his tone come on guys it isnt mine i know it isnt yours mickey said grinning because its mine i have to give it back to the owner greg told him trying not to whine but hearing his voice edge up no you dont im the owner now mickey insisted havent you ever heard of finders keepers joey asked leaning over greg menacingly he was about six inches taller than greg and a lot more muscular hey let him have the thing michael whispered in gregs ear you wanted to get rid of it right no greg protested whats your problem freckle face joey asked michael eyeing michael up and down no problem michael said meekly hey say cheese mickey aimed the camera at joey dont do it bird interrupted waving his hands frantically why not joey demanded because your face will break the camera bird said laughing youre real funny joey said sarcastically narrowing his eyes threateningly hardening his features you want that stupid smile to be permanent he raised a big fist i know this kid mickey told joey pointing at bird thinks hes hot stuff both boys stared hard at bird trying to scare him bird swallowed hard he took a step back bumping into the bleachers no i dont he said softly i dont think im hot stuff he looks like something i stepped in yesterday joey said he and mickey cracked up laughing highpitched hyena laughs and slapping each other high fives listen guys i really need the camera back greg said reaching out a hand to take it it isnt any good anyway its broken and it doesnt belong to me yeah thats right its broken michael added nodding his head yeah right mickey said sarcastically lets just see he raised the camera again and pointed it at joey really guys i need it back greg said desperately if they took a picture with the camera greg realized they might discover its secret that its snapshots showed the future showed only bad things happening to people that the camera was evil maybe it even caused evil say cheese mickey instructed joey just snap the stupid thing joey replied impatiently no greg thought i cant let this happen ive got to return the camera to the coffman house to spidey impulsively greg leapt forward with a cry he snatched the camera away from mickeys face hey mickey reacted in surprise lets go greg shouted to bird and michael and without another word the three friends turned and began running across the deserted playground towards their homes his heart thudding in his chest greg gripped the camera tightly and ran as fast as he could his sneakers pounding over the dry grass theyre going to catch us greg thought panting loudly now as he raced toward the street theyre going to catch us and pound us theyre going to take back the camera were dead meat dead meat greg and his friends didnt turn around until they were across the street breathing noisily they looked back and cried out in relieved surprise joey and mickey hadnt budged from beside the bleachers they hadnt chased after them they were leaning against the bleachers laughing catch you later guys joey called after them yeah later mickey repeated they both burst out laughing again as if they had said something hilarious that was close michael said still breathing hard they mean it bird said looking very troubled theyll catch us later were history tough talk theyre just a lot of hot air greg insisted oh yeah michael cried then why did we run like that because were late for dinner bird joked see you guys im gonna catch it if i dont hurry but the camera greg protested still gripping it tightly in one hand its too late michael said nervously raking a hand back through his red hair yeah well have to do it tomorrow or something bird agreed then you guys will come with me greg asked eagerly uh ive gotta go bird said without answering me too michael said quickly avoiding gregs stare all three of them turned their eyes back to the playground joey and mickey had disappeared probably off to terrorize some other kids later bird said slapping greg on the shoulder as he headed away the three friends split up running in different directions across lawns and driveways heading home greg had run all the way to his front yard before he remembered the snapshot he had shoved into his jeans pocket he stopped in the driveway and pulled it out the sun was lowering behind the garage he held the snapshot up close to his face to see it clearly oh no he cried i dont believe it this is impossible greg cried aloud gaping at the snapshot in his trembling hand how had shari gotten into the photo it had been taken a few minutes before in front of the bleachers on the playground but there was shari standing close beside greg his hand trembling his mouth hanging open in disbelief greg goggled at the photo it was very clear very sharp there they were on the playground he could see the baseball diamond in the background and there they were greg and shari shari standing so clear so sharp right next to him and they were both staring straight ahead their eyes wide their mouths open their expressions frozen in horror as a large shadow covered them both shari greg cried lowering the snapshot and darting his eyes over the front yard are you here can you hear me he listened silence he tried again shari are you here greg a voice called uttering a startled cry greg spun around huh greg the voice repeated it took him a while to realize that it was his mother calling to him from the front door oh hi mom feeling dazed he slid the snapshot back into his jeans pocket whereve you been his mother asked as he made his way to the door i heard about shari ive been so upset i didnt know where you were sorry mom greg said kissing her on the cheek i i shouldve left a note he stepped into the house feeling strange and outofsorts sad and confused and frightened all at the same time two days later on a day of high gray clouds the air hot and smoggy greg paced back and forth in his room after school the house was empty except for him terry had gone off a few hours before to his afterschool job at the dairy freeze mrs banks had driven to the hospital to pick up gregs dad who was finally coming home greg knew he should be happy about his dads return but there were still too many things troubling him tugging at his mind frightening him for one thing shari still hadnt been found the police were completely baffled their new theory was that shed been kidnapped her frantic grieving parents waited home by the phone but no kidnappers called to demand a ransom there were no clues of any kind nothing to do but wait and hope as the days passed greg felt more and more guilty he was sure shari hadnt been kidnapped he knew that somehow the camera had made her disappear but he couldnt tell anyone else what he believed no one would believe him anyone he tried to tell the story to would think he was crazy cameras cant be evil after all cameras cant make people fall down stairs or crash their cars or vanish from sight cameras can only record what they see greg stared out of his window pressing his forehead against the glass looking down on sharis back yard shari where are you he asked aloud staring at the tree where she had posed the camera was still hidden in the secret compartment in his headboard neither bird nor michael would agree to help greg return it to the coffman house besides greg had decided to hold on to it a while longer in case he needed it as proof in case he decided to confide his fears about it to someone in case his other fear was that spidey would come back back to gregs room back for the camera so much to be frightened about he pushed himself away from the window he had spent so much time in the past couple of days staring down at sharis empty back yard thinking thinking with a sigh he reached into the headboard and pulled out two of the snapshots he had hidden in there along with the camera the two snapshots were the ones taken the past saturday at sharis birthday party holding one in each hand greg stared at them hoping he could see something new something he hadnt noticed before but the photos hadnt changed they still showed her tree her back yard green in the sunlight and no shari no one where shari had been standing as if the lens had penetrated right through her staring at the photos greg let out a cry of anguish if only he had never gone into the coffman house if only he had never stolen the camera if only he had never taken any photos with it if only if only if only before he realized what he was doing he was ripping the two snapshots into tiny pieces panting loudly his chest heaving he tore at the snapshots and let the pieces fall to the floor when he had ripped them both into tiny shards of paper he flung himself facedown on his bed and closed his eyes waiting for his heart to stop pounding waiting for the heavy feeling of guilt and horror to lift two hours later the phone by his bed rang it was shari shari is it really you greg shouted into the phone yeah its me she sounded as surprised as he did but how i mean his mind was racing he didnt know what to say your guess is as good as mine shari told him and then she said hold on a minute and he heard her step away from the phone to talk to her mother mom stop crying already mom its really me im home a few seconds later she came back on the line ive been home for two hours and moms still crying and carrying on i feel like crying too greg admitted i i just cant believe it shari where were you the line was silent for a long moment i dont know she answered finally huh i really dont it was just so weird greg one minute there i was at my birthday party the next minute i was standing in front of my house and it was two days later but i dont remember being away or being anywhere else i dont remember anything at all you dont remember going away or coming back greg asked no nothing shari said her voice trembling shari those pictures i took of you remember with the weird camera you were invisible in them and then i disappeared she said finishing his thought shari do you think i dont know she replied quickly i i have to get off now the police are here they want to question me what am i going to tell them theyre going to think i had amnesia or flipped out or something i i dont know greg said completely bewildered we have to talk the camera i cant now she told him maybe tomorrow okay she called to her mother that she was coming bye greg see you and then she hung up greg replaced the receiver but sat on the edge of his bed staring at the phone for a long time shari was back shed been back about two hours two hours two hours two hours he turned his eyes to the clock radio beside the phone just two hours before he had ripped up the two snapshots of an invisible shari his mind whirred with wild ideas insane ideas had he brought shari back by ripping up the photos did this mean that the camera caused her to disappear that the camera caused all of the terrible things that showed up in its snapshots greg stared at the phone for a long time thinking hard he knew what he had to do he had to talk to shari and he had to return the camera he met shari on the playground the next afternoon the sun floated high in a cloudless sky eight or nine kids were engaged in a noisy brawl of a soccer game running one way then the other across the outfield of the baseball diamond hey you look like you greg exclaimed as shari came jogging up to where he stood beside the bleachers he pinched her arm yeah its you okay she didnt smile i feel fine she told him rubbing her arm just confused and tired the police asked me questions for hours and when they finally went away my parents started in sorry greg said quietly staring down at his sneakers i think mom and dad believe somehow its my fault that i disappeared shari said resting her back against the side of the bleachers shaking her head its the cameras fault greg muttered he raised his eyes to hers the camera is evil shari shrugged maybe i dont know what to think i really dont he showed her the snapshot the one showing the two of them on the playground staring in horror as a shadow crept over them how weird shari exclaimed studying it hard i want to take the camera back to the coffman house greg said heatedly i can go home and get it now will you help me will you come with me shari started to reply but stopped they both saw the dark shadow move sliding toward them quickly silently over the grass and then they saw the man dressed all in black his spindly legs pumping hard as he came at them spidey greg grabbed sharis hand frozen in fear he and shari gaped in terror as spideys slithering shadow crept over them greg had a shudder of recognition he knew the snapshot had just come true as the dark figure of spidey moved toward them like a black tarantula greg pulled sharis hand run he cried in a shrill voice he didnt recognize he didnt have to say it they were both running now gasping as they ran across the grass toward the street their sneakers thudded loudly on the ground as they reached the sidewalk and kept running greg turned to see spidey closing the gap hes catching up he managed to cry to shari who was a few steps ahead of him spidey his face still hidden in the shadows of his black baseball cap moved with startling speed his long legs kicking high as he pursued them hes going to catch us greg cried feeling as if his chest were about to burst hes too fast spidey moved even closer his shadow scuttling over the grass closer when the car horn honked greg screamed he and shari stopped short the horn blasted out again greg turned to see a familiar young man inside a small hatchback it was jerry norman who lived across the street jerry lowered his car window is this man chasing you he asked excitedly without waiting for an answer he backed the car towards spidey im calling the cops mister spidey didnt reply instead he turned and darted across the street im warning you jerry called after him but spidey had disappeared behind a tall hedge are you kids okay gregs neighbor demanded yeah fine greg managed to reply still breathing hard his chest heaving were okay thanks jerry shari said ive seen that guy around the neighborhood the young man said staring through the windshield at the tall hedge never thought he was dangerous you kids want me to call the police no its okay greg replied as soon as i give him back his camera hell stop chasing us greg thought well be careful okay jerry said you need a lift home or anything he studied their faces as if trying to determine how frightened and upset they were greg and shari both shook their heads well be okay greg said thanks jerry warned them once again to be careful then drove off his tires squealing as he turned the corner that was close shari said her eyes on the hedge why was spidey chasing us he thought i had the camera he wants it back greg told her meet me tomorrow okay in front of the coffman house help me put it back shari stared at him without replying her expression thoughtful wary were going to be in danger all of us until we put that camera back greg insisted okay shari said quietly tomorrow something scurried through the tall weeds of the unmowed front lawn what was that shari cried whispering even though no one else was in sight it was too big to be a squirrel she lingered behind greg who stopped to look up at the coffman house maybe it was a racoon or something greg told her he gripped the camera tightly in both hands it was a little after three oclock the next afternoon a hazy overcast day mountains of dark clouds threatening rain were rolling across the sky stretching behind the house casting it in shadow its going to storm shari said staying close behind greg lets get this over with and go home good idea he said glancing up at the heavy sky thunder rumbled in the distance a low roar the old trees that dotted the front yard whispered and shook we cant just run inside greg told her watching the sky darken first we have to make sure spidey isnt there making their way quickly through the tall grass and weeds they stopped at the living room window and peered in thunder rumbled low and long in the distance greg thought he saw another creature scuttle through the weeds around the corner of the house its too dark in there i cant see a thing shari complained lets check out the basement greg suggested thats where spidey hangs out remember the sky darkened to an eerie graygreen as they made their way to the back of the house and dropped to their knees to peer down through the basement windows at ground level squinting through the dustcovered windowpanes they could see the makeshift plywood table spidey had made the wardrobe against the wall its doors still open the colorful old clothing spilling out the empty frozen food boxes scattered on the floor no sign of him greg whispered cradling the camera in his arm as if it might try to escape from him if he didnt hold it tightly lets get moving are are you sure shari stammered she wanted to be brave but the thought that she had disappeared for two days completely vanished most likely because of the camera that frightening thought lingered in her mind michael and bird were chicken she thought but maybe they were the smart ones she wished this were over all over a few seconds later greg and shari pushed open the front door they stepped into the darkness of the front hall and stopped and listened and then they both jumped at the sound of the loud sudden crash directly behind them shari was the first to regain her voice its just the door she cried the wind a gust of wind had made the front door slam lets get this over with greg whispered badly shaken we never shouldve broken into this house in the first place shari whispered as they made their way on tiptoe step by creaking step down the dark hallway toward the basement stairs its a little late for that greg replied sharply pulling open the door to the basement steps he stopped again whats that banging sound upstairs sharis features tightened in fear as she heard it too a repeated almost rhythmic banging shutters greg suggested yeah she quickly agreed breathing a sigh of relief a lot of the shutters are loose remember the entire house seemed to groan thunder rumbled outside closer now they stepped onto the landing then waited for their eyes to adjust to the darkness couldnt we just leave the camera up here and run shari asked more of a plea than a question no i want to put it back greg insisted but greg she tugged at his arm as he started down the stairs no he pulled out of her grasp he was in my room shari he tore everything apart looking for it i want him to find it where it belongs if he doesnt find it hell come back to my house i know he will okay okay lets just hurry it was brighter in the basement gray light seeping down from the four groundlevel windows outside the wind swirled and pushed against the windowpanes a pale flash of lightning made shadows flicker against the basement wall the old house groaned as if unhappy about the storm what was that footsteps shari stopped halfway across the basement and listened its just the house greg insisted but his quivering voice revealed that he was as frightened as his companion and he stopped to listen too bang bang bang the shutter high above them continued its rhythmic pounding where did you find the camera anyway shari whispered following greg to the far wall across from the enormous furnace with its cobwebbed ducts sprouting up like pale tree limbs over here greg told her he stepped up to the worktable and reached for the vise clamped on the edge when i turned the vise a door opened up some kind of hidden shelf thats where the camera he cranked the handle of the vise once again the door to the secret shelf popped open good he whispered excitedly he flashed shari a smile he shoved the camera onto the shelf tucking the carrying strap under it then he pushed the door closed were out of here he felt so much better so relieved so much lighter the house groaned and creaked greg didnt care another flash of lightning brighter this time like a camera flash sent shadows flickering on the wall come on he whispered but shari was already ahead of him making her way carefully over the food cartons strewn everywhere hurrying towards the steps they were halfway up the stairs greg one step behind shari when above them spidey stepped silently into view on the landing blocking their escape greg blinked and shook his head as if he could shake away the image of the figure that stared darkly down at him no shari cried out and fell back against greg he grabbed for the railing forgetting that it had fallen under michaels weight during their first unfortunate visit to the house luckily shari regained her balance before toppling them both down the stairs lightning flashed behind them sending a flash of white light across the stairway but the unmoving figure on the landing above them remained shrouded in darkness let us go greg finally managed to cry finding his voice yeah we returned your camera shari added sounding shrill and frightened spidey didnt reply instead he took a step towards them onto the first step and then he descended another step nearly stumbling again greg and shari backed down to the basement floor the wooden stairs squeaked in protest as the dark figure stepped slowly steadily down as he reached the basement floor a crackling bolt of lightning cast a blue light over him and greg and shari saw his face for the first time in the brief flash of color they saw that he was old older than they had imagined that his eyes were small and round like dark marbles that his mouth was small too pursed in a tight menacing grimace we returned the camera shari said staring in fear as spidey crept closer cant we go now please let me see spidey said his voice was younger than his face warmer than his eyes come they hesitated but he gave them no choice ushering them back across the cluttered floor to the worktable he wrapped his large spidery hand over the vise and turned the handle the door opened he pulled out the camera and held it close to his face to examine it you shouldnt have taken it he told them speaking softly turning the camera in his hands were sorry shari said quickly can we go now greg asked edging towards the stairs its not an ordinary camera spidey said raising his small eyes to them we know greg blurted out the pictures it took they spideys eyes grew wide his expression angry you took pictures with it just a few greg told him wishing he had kept his mouth shut they didnt come out really you know about the camera then spidey said moving quickly to the center of the floor was he trying to block their escape greg wondered its broken or something greg said uncertainly shoving his hands into his jeans pockets its not broken the tall dark figure said softly its evil he motioned toward the low plywood table sit there shari and greg exchanged glances then reluctantly they sat down on the edge of the board sitting stiffly nervously their eyes darting towards the stairway towards escape the camera is evil spidey repeated standing over them holding the camera in both hands i should know i helped to create it youre an inventor greg asked glancing at shari who was nervously tugging at a strand of her black hair im a scientist spidey replied or i should say i was a scientist my name is fredericks dr fritz fredericks he transferred the camera from one hand to the other my lab partner invented this camera it was his pride and joy more than that it would have made him a fortune would have i say he paused a thoughtful expression sinking over his face what happened to him did he die shari asked still fiddling with the strand of hair dr fredericks snickered no worse i stole the invention from him i stole the plans and the camera i was evil you see i was young and greedy so very greedy and i wasnt above stealing to make my fortune he paused eyeing them both as if waiting for them to say something to offer their disapproval of him perhaps but when greg and shari remained silent staring up at him from the low plywood table he continued his story when i stole the camera it caught my partner by surprise unfortunately from then on all of the surprises were mine a strange sad smile twisted across his aged face my partner you see was much more evil than i was dr fredericks coughed into his hand then began to pace in front of greg and shari as he talked speaking softly slowly as if remembering the story for the first time in a long while my partner was a true evil one he dabbled in the dark arts i should correct myself he didnt just dabble he was quite a master of it all he held up the camera waving it above his head then lowering it my partner put a curse on the camera if he couldnt profit from it he wanted to make sure that i never would either and so he put a curse on it he turned his gaze on greg leaning over him do you know about how some primitive peoples fear the camera they fear the camera because they believe that if it takes their picture it will steal their soul he patted the camera well this camera really does steal souls staring up at the camera greg shuddered the camera had stolen shari away would it have stolen all of their souls people have died because of this camera dr fredericks said uttering a slow sad sigh people close to me that is how i came to learn of the curse to learn of the cameras evil and then i learned something just as frightening the camera cannot be destroyed he coughed cleared his throat noisily and began to pace in front of them again and so i vowed to keep the camera a secret to keep it away from people so it cannot do its evil i lost my job my family i lost everything because of it but i am determined to keep the camera where it can do no harm he stopped pacing with his back towards them he stood silently shoulders hunched lost in thought greg quickly climbed to his feet and motioned for shari to do the same well uh i guess its good we returned it he said hesitantly sorry we caused so much trouble yeah were very sorry shari repeated sincerely guess its back in the right hands goodbye greg said starting towards the steps its getting late and we no dr fredericks shouted startling them both he moved quickly to block the way im afraid you cant go you know too much i can never let you leave dr fredericks said his face flickering in the blue glow of a lightning flash he crossed his bony arms in front of his black sweatshirt but we wont tell anyone greg said his voice rising until the words became a plea really your secret is good with us shari insisted her frightened eyes on greg dr fredericks stared at them menacingly but didnt reply you can trust us greg said his voice quivering he cast a frightened glance at shari besides shari said even if we did tell anyone who would believe us enough talk dr fredericks snapped it wont do you any good ive worked too long and too hard to keep the camera a secret a rush of wind pushed against the windows sending up a low howl the wind carried a drumroll of rain the sky through the basement windows was as black as night you cant keep us here forever shari cried unable to keep the growing terror from her voice the rain pounded against the windows now a steady downpour dr fredericks drew himself up straight seemed to grow taller his tiny eyes burned into sharis im so sorry he said his voice a whisper of regret so sorry but i have no choice he took another step towards them greg and shari exchanged frightened glances from where they stood in front of the low plywood table in the center of the basement the steps seemed a hundred miles away whwhat are you going to do greg cried shouting over a burst of thunder that rattled the basement windows please shari begged dont dr fredericks moved forward with surprising speed holding the camera in one hand he grabbed gregs shoulder with the other no greg screamed let go let go of him shari screamed she suddenly realized that both of dr fredericks hands were occupied this may be my only chance she thought she took a deep breath and lunged forward dr fredericks eyes bulged and he cried out in surprise as shari grabbed the camera with both hands and pulled it away from him he made a frantic grab for the camera and greg burst free before the desperate man could take another step shari raised the camera to her eye and pointed the lens at him please no dont push the button the old man cried he lurched forward his eyes wild and grabbed the camera with both hands greg stared in horror as shari and dr fredericks grappled both holding onto the camera each trying desperately to wrestle it away from the other flash the bright burst of light startled them all shari grabbed the camera run she screamed the basement became a whirring blur of grays and blacks as greg hurtled himself towards the stairs he and shari ran side by side slipping over the food cartons jumping over tin cans and empty bottles rain thundered against the windows the wind howled pushing against the glass they could hear dr fredericks anguished screams behind them did it take our picture or his shari asked i dont know just hurry greg screamed the old man was howling like a wounded animal his cries competing with the rain and wind pushing at the windows the stairs werent that far away but it seemed to take forever to reach them forever forever greg thought dr fredericks wanted to keep shari and him down there forever panting loudly they both reached the dark stairway a deafening clap of thunder made them stop and turn around huh greg cried aloud to his shock dr fredericks hadnt chased after them and his anguished cries had stopped the basement was silent whats going on shari cried breathlessly squinting back into the darkness it took greg a while to realize that the dark rumpled form lying on the floor in front of the worktable was dr fredericks what happened shari cried her chest heaving as she struggled to catch her breath still clinging to the camera strap she gaped in surprise at the old mans still body sprawled on its back on the floor i dont know greg replied in a breathless whisper reluctantly greg started back towards dr fredericks following close behind shari uttered a low cry of horror when she clearly saw the fallen mans face eyes bulged out the mouth open in a twisted o of terror the face stared up at them frozen dead dr fredericks was dead what happened shari finally managed to say swallowing hard forcing herself to turn away from the ghastly tortured face i think he died of fright greg replied squeezing her shoulder and not even realizing it huh fright he knew better than anyone what the camera could do greg said when you snapped his picture i think i think it scared him to death i only wanted to throw him offguard shari cried i only wanted to give us a chance to escape i didnt think the picture greg interrupted lets see the picture shari raised the camera the photo was still halfinside the camera greg pulled it out with a trembling hand he held it up so they could both see it wow he exclaimed quietly wow the photo showed dr fredericks lying on the floor his eyes bulging his mouth frozen open in horror dr fredericks fright greg realized the fright that had killed him was there frozen on film frozen on his face the camera had claimed another victim this time forever what do we do now shari asked staring down at the figure sprawled at their feet first im putting this camera back greg said taking it from her and shoving it back on its shelf he turned the vise handle and the door to the secret compartment closed greg breathed a sigh of relief hiding the dreadful camera away made him feel so much better now lets go home and call the police he said two days later a cool bright day with a gentle breeze rustling the trees the four friends stopped at the curb leaning on their bikes and stared up at the coffman house even in bright sunlight the old trees that surrounded the house covered it in shade so you didnt tell the police about the camera bird asked staring up at the dark empty front window no they wouldnt believe it greg told him besides the camera should stay locked up forever forever i hope no one ever finds out about it we told the police we ran into the house to get out of the rain shari added and we said we started to explore while we waited for the storm to blow over and we found the body in the basement what did spidey die of michael asked gazing up at the house the police said it was heart failure greg told him but we know the truth wow i cant believe one old camera could do so much evil bird said i believe it greg said quietly lets get out of here michael urged he raised his sneakers to the pedals and started to roll away this place really creeps me out the other three followed pedaling away in thoughtful silence they had turned the corner and were heading up the next block when two figures emerged from the back door of the coffman house joey ferris and mickey ward stepped over the weedchoked lawn onto the driveway those jerks arent too bright joey told his companion they never even saw us the other day never saw us watching them through the basement window mickey laughed yeah theyre jerks they couldnt hide this camera from us no way man joey said he raised the camera and examined it take my picture mickey demanded come on lets try it out yeah okay joey raised the viewfinder to his eye say cheese a click a flash a whirring sound joey pulled the snapshot from the camera and both boys eagerly huddled around it waiting to see what developed
