bibi by mike resnick and susan shwartz her childrens cries woke her from her safe nest she stretched easing the aches in her bones in the quiet dawn she ventured to the lake for water she saw less of her enemies spoor than ever before almost nothing was freshly dead though a few circling birds warned her soon not my children she wailed silently they were fevered and ill and even dying but where were they no one crouched beside the lake no one edged through the bush seeking her she had to find them soon before she was a mother without children the land was dry and brown as it had always been but there were differences the footpaths were missing the birds no longer fled in fear of her the few antelope she saw were smaller and quicker than any she could remember she felt uneasy walking in the open with no trees to climb should she come across those fearsome doglike creatures that could swallow her in three bites she gripped her club which was really nothing more than an old femur bone she had watched a great cat bring down an antelope and waited patiently for it to fill its belly then fought the birds for the spoils and came away with a weapon as well as a meal she looked up again the birds seemed smaller and they were the wrong colors they were still ominous and foreboding as they rode the thermals high above the savannah and sought the flesh of the newly dead as the sun rose higher she withdrew into the comforting shadows of the trees her stomach cried out and she turned over a dry log looking for termites but the log crumbled into dust and she realized even as she sifted through its remains finding a few laggard insects that the main army had moved on to choicer morsels how easy it used to be to find food in the kinder days of her youth she could have traveled fast grubbing food from the earth or from hanging branches now it took her hours to fill her belly so it did not cry like a baby and she barely heard the cries or coughs of beasts her feet bled tender after her long rest but she trudged on she had slept too long the camp lay kilometers due west of moroto in the blistering heat of the karamojo country even the flies had become lethargic dust devils swirled across the empty landscape red and angry reaching hundreds of feet into the startling blue sky two boreholes supplied water for all the tents one teased them with cool clear water for two or three minutes at a time then went dead for half an hour or more while the other offered a slow sluggish trickle of warm brown liquid wake up wake up a weight landed on jeremy harriss cot and a child shrilled in his ears translating the childs excited swahili automatically jeremy fixed his tormentor not four feet high with a bleary eye then glanced outside what the hell was the kid doing waking him up in practically the middle of the night dr umurungi told me to fetch you you remember old kabute he died around midnight jeremy remembered the man not forty yet impossibly aged almost mummified in the final emaciation of the aids that threatened to finish the job in uganda that idi amin began and milton obote had carried forward they died sooner or later everyone died the childs eyes reflected awareness and resignation hed already lost both parents to the disease and was hivpositive himself it would be a miracle if he reached puberty forget azt the relief workers were happy if they could provide three meals a day im sorry said jeremy do they want me to talk to the family he could think of several people better qualified by language or race to talk to the mans family an elderly mother two withered wives one bore the marks of kaposis sarcoma purple against black and coughed almost constantly there were several children jeremy would have bet good money that all of them were hivpositive jeremy was a volunteer not a physician if they needed him to drive he drove if they wanted him to perform medical tests they taught him and looked the other way if they wanted an english class he taught it when it came to bribing officials he was without peer best of all when they needed emergency funding his old wall street training could usually wring it from some unsuspecting philanthropical prey or allow the prey to donate it anonymously and still keep his tax break what they mostly needed these days however was a gravedigger in new york jeremy had worked out with a trainer who came to his private gym when he didnt go to his university club his companys fitness center or any of the places that took up a large part of his very private life but digging graves out here in the bush put more muscle on him than his trainer would have dreamed possible dr umurungi said they left the compound taking kabutes body with them the boy opened the tent flap wider jeremy winced at the sunrise and swore with the inventive profanity of the equity traders he used to match drink for drink at harrys not only would the women and children not get proper care so what if they die a month before their time the darkness in him muttered were all on death row here but carrying a corpse theyd be lucky if they didnt run afoul of hyenas on the plain or crocs crossing the rivers on their way back to their village and that was on the unlikely assumption that it hadnt been looted by somali or sudanese bandits he lowered his feet decisively and the child practically hugged himself with relief reaching for his boots and trousers jeremy shook them before he put them on he folded his bedding just so a place for everything or youd go crazy living in a cluttered tent in an aids relief camp everything in its place he unlocked the box where he kept his megavitamins and the other drugs downing a handful of pills without water before replacing the phials next to his portfolio statements medical records and a few letters the most recent was from his parents in vermont he knew it by heart it wasnt very long surprisingly it wasnt his mother who had written it but his father who had always been better with tools than words the fact that jeremy could continually force unnatural life into the camps ancient truck was a gift from his father that hed only now come to value as a boy he had lived in terror that those skills would chain him to grimy hands and greasestained clothes to life in a gas station a town a way of life he had fought to escape son you didnt want your mother and me to come to the airport and see you off so i didnt get a chance to see you i dont suppose id have been able to say what ive been thinking about there anyhow things move too fast for me in new york and you probably were all taken up with getting things arranged and saying goodbye to your friends and with your mother there trying not to cry i couldnt have said what i wanted to say weve never had all that much to say to each other that wasnt cars or hows your schoolwork going or thats really interesting and now im sorry i always though maybe i was the wrong father for you but thats water under the bridge i want you to know that you dont have to do this youre my son and im proud of you if youre sick come home and your mother and i will take care of you you always have a place here love your dad very gently jeremy replaced the letter in its sheltering plastic bag then he pulled out the small tattered box with the monogrammed cufflinks and the unopened letter jeremy remembered the man to whom hed given the cufflinks as always he was surprised that the box had reached him with the letter and the rejected gift inside it would have been a mercy if some official had heard the cufflinks rattling around and stolen the box before it reached him it was a mercy that raymond hadnt thrown the cufflinks at him along with his anger when he learned just how disastrously careless jeremy had been gifts always giving me things like i didnt know how to choose for myself well this last gift you gave me was really a killer wasnt it ray had walked out slamming the door on jeremy and any chance theyd had for a life together and all those gifts except for the deadly one he carried inside him jeremy left the box under the pillow on his cot and stuck the letter into his pocket maybe today hed find the time or the guts to open it or throw it away or maybe hed lose it he turned back to face the little boy i do have to be here he told the ghost of his father everything in its proper place just as he was automatically he scanned himself no lesions no fever no faint weariness no cough no trace of night sweats nothing to worry about yet like so many of the people in his world jeremy harris was hivpositive the verdict had surprised the hell out of him though he supposed it shouldnt have his life had been so precisely arranged the hour weeks where weekends blended into weekdays and when he sometimes lived on the phone so he could make his pile and pay for the place on fire island the weeks and weekends down in the keys where the beer was cold the seafood spicy and the company hed better not think of that or of how many of his old friends were still alive you had to walk a very fine line between indifference which could kill you and caring too much which would tear you apart the last time hed visited his old haunts the keys had been like a ghost town no one knew where raymond was that whole group of writers and artists and smart guys with money had turned into people like his father no good at words about the real things the survivors were either drinking themselves into oblivion or like jeremy working to the point of exhaustion while becoming health and diet fanatics and for what to watch their other friends die while waiting for a cure that of them could never afford even if it was discovered he subscribed to medical journals and followed the latest research on siv simian immunodeficiency virus and the vaccine harvard med school had developed one that protected monkeys for three years hed even allowed himself to hope when johns hopkins turned up a yearold woman whod had three healthy children after being diagnosed hivpositive and when try as they might they couldnt get infectious hiv from her blood maybe im a mutant just like her he thought desperately which of course made him feel even more like an outcast from the human race he went to montreal to visit biochem pharma where a new drug tc in combination with atz showed promising results he monitored the glaxowellcome plc merger with the attention the dying gave to the last rites because that had to affect the supply of the azt he expected to need one day what good did it do him all the biotechs had tanked azt was more a poison than a cure and with healthcare costs the way they were of course as long as he raked in the commissions he had key man insurance from his company he hardly thought theyd keep it up when he got really sick and if he changed companies and came down with arc or fullblown aids there he was with a preexisting condition when his money finally ran out his portfolio was only solid not huge hed be out on the street and that wasnt wall street and on whatever might be left of medicaid by that time so jeremy kept fit every day he scanned himself for deterioration as his friends and lovers sickened and died around him jeremy realized that he was what researchers called a nonprogressor he might have years yet one man infected years ago still had a normal cd white blood cell count maybe jeremy would get lucky too day after day he worked and worked out and waited either for the disease or a cure you cant call that living at all his psychiatrist said at an audrey hepburn revival at the thalia for gods sake a handout told him how shed starved as a child working for the resistance until cancer left her too weak to continue shed tried to feed kids in ethiopia the very next day the wall street journal had carried a story on the aids epidemic in zambia and uganda if that wasnt some sort of omen he didnt know a thing about market timing so hed liquidated his stock positions and parked the money in secure triplea bond funds said goodbye to his trainer sold his coop for a good price despite rotten interest rates and unloaded his beach house his friends thought hed gone crazy his psychiatrist thought hed gone sane and helped him negotiate the wilderness of regulations and his family simply cried and wanted him to come back home where everyone would whisper about jeff harriss boy what a shame so young to go money and some damn good networking had enabled him to hook up with a small relief organization and so here he was he finished his daily checklist nothing left out for kids or monkeys to steal everything in its proper place except for the finishing touch hed given up the hermes ties the customtailored suits the meticulous manhattan grooming for the cheapest toughest coolest clothes he could find but one grace note remained from his footlocker he pulled out a spool of red ribbon cut off a couple inches and pinned it to his shirt the boys eyes widened and he held out an eager hand so jeremy grinned and cut him an aids ribbon too and out they went he began walking through the camp which seemed like two separate worlds to him or actually three there was the world inhabited by the camps employees immaculate tents in a cluster a spotless mess area the infirmary it was too small and too easily victimized by the elements to call it a hospital even infirmary seemed to give it an unearned dignity then there was the world of the africans they had come by the dozens and finally the hundreds once word got out that another crazy european was passing out free food and medicine and a small city of mud and thatched huts now completely encircled the world of the camp attendants finally there was that tiny world inhabited only by himself and elizabeth a pair of people who didnt fit in either of the other worlds jeremy whose medical training was limited to a lifesaving badge he earned in swimming class when he was twelve and elizabeth who had been born in uganda and raised in europe and didnt quite belong to either society as he passed a huge pile of folded unused tents he saw a troop of vervet monkeys edging closer to an extended family of africans that were warming their banana mash breakfasts over a fire hunger had made the monkeys brave bravery had made them foolish and jeremy knew that at least one family was going to be having meat for lunch at last he reached the mess tent and came to a stop before elizabeth who was writing meticulous notes in a journal while her tea sat untouched and cooling right next to the coleman lamp on the breakfast table is that you jeremy she asked without looking up dr elizabeth umurungis enunciation always sounded like an upperclass englishwoman one who spoke perfect french rather than a conventeducated achole who had fled to britain with her parents when idi amin started decimating the countryside no its father damian he told her wrapping his sweater about his narrow shoulders it was strange every evening he went to sleep sweating and wondering if hed ever be cool again and every morning he woke up shivering and wondering if hed ever be warm again that was africa for you all things considered youd hardly qualify as a saint she retorted pity we could use a miracle or two shed been finishing up her residency about the time hed done his mba they had friends or at least contacts in common and in what felt like another life theyd skiied the same hills in switzerland one of the few people he had confided in she monitored his tcell status along with those of the ugandans whose long defeats she fought she poured him a battered mug of tea that he eyed suspiciously so its not that designer herbal muck you used to buy it wont kill you dehydration and hunger will sit he would have liked to eat by the fire preferring the chilly air and the smoke to the cramped dark interior and endless medical conversation of the mess hall but as much as he was bored by such talk he was even more bored with his own company so he decided to eat at elizabeths table his meal consisted not of the meticulously chosen weighed and cooked health foods that he had considered a matter of the merest survival but rather of posho and banana mash which even here wasnt much think i ought to make a supply run he asked she shrugged i got a dividend check he volunteered be nice to buy chickens we could use the carcasses for soup she finally looked up at him homesick for manhattan chicken soup isnt that magic as long as we can feed everyone in camp fine but i do need you to drive me somewhere he bowed elaborately with him she wouldnt have to worry about assault or about getting back to the compound safely you want to track down the villagers that left this morning jabito told me about them when he woke me up jabito gossips too much old head young shoulders what do you expect i expect people not to slip away from doctors who are trying to help them said elizabeth with the hauteur acquired in a childhood spent commuting between paris london and kampala elizabeth might have learned patience and compassion in her selfappointed mission to help rebuild the country that had exiled her family but the airs of the grande dame still clung to her though jeremy had to admit that on her even a tattered lab coat and old crew tshirt looked chic shed been a model in paris not the type hed pretended to drool over as a nervous teenager reading sports illustrateds swimsuit issue every year but the sort of model who turned up in vogue and had designers fighting each other over who would have the privilege this season of draping thousands of dollars of silk over her arrogant elegant bones once and future stars were always chucking careers and going back to school so the story on her in people supermodel abandons runways for med school produced a raised eyebrow or two before everyone in jeremys study group went back to being cool and working their asses off while that might impress the locals it also intimidated them and they kept her at a distance that saddened her for all the darkness of her skin she was as much a foreigner here as jeremy maybe even more of one ive got their medical records such as they are she added you got a land rover she smiled at him better than that ive got a flatbed truck with an almostnew spare tire whered you get it he asked excitedly i thought you told me you were just about out of money i am we got it from a donor she paused then amended her statement i got it from a donor youre not the only financial wizard around here if youre a financial wizard how did you manage to run through all those millions you made modeling he asked with a smile that was almost smug she sighed i bribed a lot of the wrong people when i decided to set up the camp then i had to go back and bribe the right ones our equipment cost a fortune to import were on our fifth land rover do you know how much they cost and how quickly they die out here she paused then added ruefully and then there were my little blunders like one hundred tents nobody wants to sleep in they were more than eight hundred dollars apiece and i cant get a single patient to spend a night in one he wanted to teasingly say well theyre your people but he bit the words off just in time they were no longer her people and in fact distrusted this westernized woman this black european even more than they distrusted jeremy who in their eyes was just another wellintentioned bumbling american a typical twoyear wonder who was working out his guilt at his parents expense of course they wont sleep in them said jeremy tents have corners and demons live in corners much better to live in nice round huts did they tell you that he nodded why didnt they tell me youre a ugandan he said they probably assumed you knew i left when i was a child she said irritably i cant remember every little superstition they we have she paused i wish i knew why they confide in you and not in me us subordinates know not to trust the big chief he said with a smile for a moment he thought she would explode with anger but finally she laughed anyway she added ive actually got two jerrycans of petrol and a radio well travel in style and with enough room to bring back the villagers whether they want to come or not assuming we dont find them dead by the side of the road or such parts of them as the hyenas leave what if they dont want to come what happens to the children countered elizabeth the old lady cant do it all its sad two daughtersinlaw both with children under normal circumstances shed have all the makings of an easy honored old age the daughtersinlaw would do all the work for her she sighed deeply but now shell be tending them and bringing up the children until they get sick too does she test positive shes negative but thats not surprising she lives a traditional lifestyle and in her culture women dont have sex once they reach menopause besides her husband died years ago the son must have picked it up from his circumcision group or maybe from some whore in kampala or entebbe she gestured to a beatup flatbed truck at the far side of the compound get your gear and lets get this show on the road ill wait for you at the truck he joined her a few minutes later climbed into the drivers seat put the vehicle in gear and they were on their way the road wound in and out of the bush passing through dozens of villages many of them totally deserted though it was impossible at first glance to determine whether they were empty due to war or aids god i hate these potholes muttered jeremy as the ride began doing painful things to his spine and kidneys the locals play games trying to figure out whose they are said elizabeth with a bitter smile whose what are repeated jeremy uncomprehendingly the potholes she explained they try to guess whether they were made by amins troops or nyereres or obotes or okellos or musavetis what a delightful way to spend your childhood said jeremy wryly trying to guess which homicidal monster destroyed the road through your village musavetis a good man said elizabeth adamantly and nyerere is a saint three out of five still isnt good odds replied jeremy especially when you have to live through it all elizabeth quickly grabbed her hat as another bump sent it flying toward her window we should reach the end of the tarmac pretty soon she said it gets better then its much better right after the long rains you cant repair tarmac out here but if its just holes in a dirt road the rains will have leveled it out nothing can level this road out said jeremy devoutly he looked out the side window just as the tarmac ended the thornbush which had been rapidly encroaching on both the savannah and the roadside shambas had triumphed totally the grass which was green and endless a few miles back now existed only in isolated pockets and was dotted by the bones of dead wildebeest and kob the red dust from the road obscured his vision but he could see troops of vervet monkeys plus an occasional red colobus scampering through the trees and observing the strangesounding foulsmelling vehicle from the safety of the branches as the truck slowed down to cross a lugga a dry riverbed jeremy saw a figure disappearing into the thornscrub some fifty yards off to his right what is it asked elizabeth as jeremy brought the truck to a halt theres something back there what he shook his head i dont know he paused and frowned i think it was a woman or a child it was too small to be a man she shrugged nothing unusual about that ugandas got a lot of people and a lot of bush you tend to find the one in the other stop patronizing me he said irritably then stop belaboring the obvious she replied you saw a woman in the bush there was something funny though funny haha or funny strange she asked funny strange what he paused uncomfortably i only caught a quick glimpse of her or him but but what she persisted she walked like her feet hurt and nobody in africa walks like that maybe she cut her foot the average african spends his whole life walking barefoot on rocks and in thornbush country i dont think you could cut his foot open with a knife nonsense she said i cut my own foot just two days ago youre not the average african he retorted you spent most your life in europe and america she ignored his comment picked up the binoculars and held them to her eyes theres nothing out there probably it was a heat mirage or maybe the glare on the windshield made you think you saw a woman instead of a tree he shrugged maybe or maybe his eyes could be starting to go except that it was way too early in the disease cycle for him to hallucinate and besides he didnt have the disease yet jeremy continued looking out the window as he started driving again he spotted a pair of silverbacked jackals and a few minutes later he had to swerve to avoid a family of hyenas that were fighting over the remains of a small duiker but there was no sign of the small figure he had seen or thought he had seen he noticed that sweat was starting to pour down his body and he transferred the letter to another pocket to keep it dry what is that she asked oh nothing he replied just a letter from an old friend you havent opened it yet ill get around to it would you like me to read it to you while youre driving she offered not necessary he said its no trouble no they came to another village there were sixteen hatched huts falling to ruin nearby was a large thorn boma for the cattle next to it were four deserted shambas the mango and banana trees fighting a losing battle for survival against the encroaching bush the village had a well so that the people would not have to drink contaminated water there was only one problem no people like so many other villages it was completely deserted i get so sick of seeing this remarked elizabeth gesturing toward the empty huts where to now asked jeremy staring ahead to where the road forked and went off in two directions im not quite sure but i seem to think we go to the northwest she saw a strange beast growling constantly and belching a foulsmelling smoke it was like nothing she had ever experienced strange and terrifying even for this strange and terrifying land she quickly hid behind a thornbush and waited for it to gallop off the beast had a most unusual means of enticing its victims instead of stealthily creeping up and then pouncing like the great cats and canines it showed her an image of a human very similar to herself doubtless she was expected to approach it out of curiosity and it would open its slavering jaws and swallow her whole she would have to be prepared for this beast in the future for she had much to do and would doubtless encounter it again they managed to get lost of course after three days of punctured tires false paths bug bites and fraying tempers the truck crashed out of the underbrush a scant twentysix miles from where it had entered and turned onto the narrow almost overgrown track that was the best road jeremy could find with sweat map frequently profane radio exchanges and the occasional shout to any people they passed on the road look up ahead said elizabeth pointing as they approached a village a thread of smoke curled upward and a flock of birds flew overhead jeremy was used to children spotting his land rover and running ahead or alongside with wild shouts but for some reason the inhabitants of this village even the children silently watched the truck and then went about their business what do you make of that asked jeremy frowning as the truck crunches over the rough road i dont know said elizabeth they know were bringing food and medicine they should be swarming out to greet us have you ever seen a reaction like this no she said frowning not even when i was a little girl they dont act afraid he noted just i dont know wary next to one of the huts was a mound of heaped dirt even though it had been encircled by a crude fence that must have caused someone a lot of trouble to construct and erect the ground was trampled the clods scattered in places as if something had tried to dig it up jeremy felt a muscle along his jaw jerk they wouldnt have had a whole lot of strength to spare to dig the mans grave deep enough and there was always the problem of how to get out of the pit once it had been dug two children squatted by the roadside waving at him when he waved back they rose slowly he thought he recognized them theyd been fed in the camp for almost a week but the long walk home had sweated the newlygained weight off of them already their ribs were showing above their bellies which thank god had at least not started to swell out in severe malnutritions dreadful parody of fat squatting outside the nearest hut the healthier or rather the least sick of the dead mans young wives tended a few scrawny chickens beyond the huts an emaciated ox raised its head at the newcomers then went back to the allimportant business of grazing the neargrassless land the oldest child pushed at the ox driving it toward two cows in equally poor condition still concluded jeremy these villagers were better off than a lot he had seen they had posho from the relief center they would have milk they might even have eggs and meat it was a wonder they had anything left at all for years this entire country had been little more than the scene of a crime that called itself a government and now hardly a step up it had become a plague site god help them all tall and thin her head high the mother of the dead man appeared in a doorway she had an infant in her arms two others clinging to her legs she walked over to the squatting woman and handed her the child the younger woman opened her dress and the child began to nurse or to try to thatll infect the baby jeremy muttered you want them to talk to us then be quiet elizabeth got out of the truck raised a hand in greeting and spoke in a formal swahili totally different from the kitchen swahili jeremy had learned jeremy killed the motor opened the door stepped down and joined elizabeth just as the woman raised a hand greetings should have gone on ceremoniously with an invitation to a meal to follow but there was little food and less time to spare as her apologetic gestures seemed to indicate abruptly she clapped her hands the children scattered disappearing into various huts to emerge wearing the ragged michael jordan tshirts they had received each decorated with a loop of red ribbon jeremy grinned he remembered giving out those ribbons and slipping a dime to one of the kids who had lost a front tooth the day before the tooth fairy comes to uganda right id grant you three wishes kid if i could we know you mean well memsaab the old woman was saying but we have no faith in your magic we prefer our own that is why we came home but who will help you asked elizabeth trying to ignore the word memsaab which was only offered to whites and outsiders never from one black ugandan to another your grandchildren are too young your son is dead and his wives are sick she paused it is not right that you live alone without family to share your burdens i wish you would let us bring you back jeremy blurted in english damn it jeremy hissed elizabeth i know you mean well but thats an insult the old woman turned to jeremy my father is dead she said my husband is dead my sons are dead my grandsons are too young to give me orders uganda has been independent for long rains i will not take orders from you or any other european i need no longer call you bwana when jeremy had finally stammered an apology elizabeth took pity on him why dont you unload the truck she suggested that won her a look of awe from the old woman for all her dedication her swahili her attempt to make herself seem like a good daughter of the tribe elizabeth was still a european to them she was all the more alien for being a black european and a woman who could give orders to men especially white men in this society where brides were still bought and sold if you will have us instant protest invitation and apology followed in order how could she doubt her welcome we shall stay for a few days and observe the children we can make ourselves useful to you the woman smiled surprisingly given her age and health she still possessed most of her teeth and they glinted in the sunlight but i have help memsaab elizabeth flinched that word again so much for sisterhood and fitting in my bibi has come to help me her baby asked jeremy trying to translate bibi is mother answered elizabeth youve seen those signs in the burntout stores and dukas along the road to kampala the ones that say babito thats a contraction or actually an acronym for baba bibi and toto father mother and baby in other words stores for the whole family she paused now please go unload the truck before you offend her again jeremy unloaded sack after sack of posho the cornmeal that the africans made into a porridge and finally a precious box of powdered milk that they could use for the babies when their mothers milk ran dry if he had anything to say about it theyd be drinking it now if a mother was hiv positive a baby could pick it up from breast milk if it hadnt already contracted it in the womb elizabeth umurungi disappeared into the dark interior of the hut with her medical bag leaving jeremy standing outside the children approached to watch him as he finished unloading the truck aware of their presence he pocketed the keys reached into the glove compartment and slipped the revolver into his pocket no sense putting temptation in their way when he walked to the door of the hut elizabeth and the old woman were kneeling beside a pallet that held the second wife jeremy remembered her from the relief center he was surprised she had made it back alive get me some water elizabeth ordered not even bothering to turn around rubbing alcohol too we have to bring this fever down one of the children immediately ran off to obey this notquitestranger with her shiny instruments and her way of commanding a man taller and stronger than their father had been when the child sloshed back with a tin pan filled with dubiously clean water jeremy carried it and the rubbing alcohol inside elizabeth sponged the woman on the pallet while the other woman hovered and tried to sooth the patient the sick womans face glowed the life flickering in it like embers in an ebony lantern building flaring up at any moment he thought it would surely burn out into darkness help hold her still elizabeth ordered when the patient began thrashing and jeremy who had always worn sweatbands and gloves when working out in his west side gym leapt to obey when they finished the old woman held her daughterinlaw against her shoulder while elizabeth brought out a syringe and administered it of the old womans bibi there was no sign at all probably she was too shy or too frightened to even look at the strangers jeremy didnt envy elizabeth the task of coaxing her out where she could be examined jeremy paused sleeping bag in hand and looked around the hut that had been allotted them he was used to sweat blotching his shirts the instant he put them on he was used to insects used to animals used to taking care of people in ways that would have made the men on the trading desk pass out but the dark claustrophobic hut with its longunswept floor its hovering whining flies his imagination conjured up sleeping sickness yellow fever and typhoid for starters and then began dwelling on more exotic diseases elizabeth simply shrugged and spread her sleeping bag out on the floor maybe it was only dried mud but it certainly smelled like cow dung dinner had come and gone a scrawny chicken they had protested that they had their own supplies they could perfectly well feed themselves and everyone else but the chicken had been killed and stewed and they had had to eat it with every evidence of appreciation for the sacrifice it represented despite reprimands from mother and grandmother to let their guests eat in peace jeremy managed to feed at least half his dinner to the kids he felt like a guilty child himself feeding the family dog beneath the table and then felt even guiltier for equating these starving children to household pets it was a feast to them and when their faces shone with the meager fat from the chicken skin they started to yawn and soon wandered off elizabeth and jeremy left the hut and sat outside it poking at a fire jeremy had insisted on building he promised himself that tomorrow hed show the children how to toast things on it wondering what he could substitute for marshmallows he pulled out rays letter studied it thoughtfully and then placed it back in his pocket unopened beyond the circle of the village and its tiny fields darker than the night sky lay uncleared land the forest was coming back after the devastation of the past decades and slowly the wild creatures were returning a hyena giggled maniacally a lion coughed and far off in the distance hippos grunted and bellowed elizabeth picked up a green branch and maneuvered a few smoldering logs they suddenly burst into flame and a shower of sparks rose into the dark african sky where did you learn to tend a fire asked jeremy whose camp duty it was to build fires for an instant her eyes lit with humor in girl guides she answered with a smile certainly not in the bush jeremy forced himself not to grimace he still held his rolledup sleeping bag are you going to hang onto that security blanket all night she asked why dont i sleep out in the truck he suggested more proper for the hired hand wouldnt you say whatever makes you happy said elizabeth those kids look like theyd love to spend the night talking with you it was obvious that she would much rather have been able to say us than you suddenly she swatted a tsetse fly with surgical efficiency it lay still for a minute then got to its feet and groggily walked off nobody ever told me they were armorplated until i got here said jeremy staring ruefully at the fly if they get any worse i may join you we can take turns standing guard she sighed deeply i wish we had some light she continued better than the firelight i mean id like to run some tests on that woman she ought to be dead from that fever she had a body temp of at least she was burning up jeremy agreed i thought id be digging a grave he had been so careful to restrain the sick womans flailing hands face it he had been afraid just as hed been every day since he came here with every patient he touched he faced the question are you the one wholl kick my tcells out of balance will your aids be the death of me too it was no different for him than for the other relief workers he knew that he was no one special but he was ashamed to ask if the others were afraid too did you see asked elizabeth at least she could escape into the discipline of her profession she could do something her lesions actually seem to be shrinking there was a drug on the market that reduced lesions chicken pox or kaposis sarcoma it made no difference but it was so expensive theyd need the treasure of king solomons mines to pay for it any chance of remission jeremy kept his face out of the firelight so she wouldnt see the wild hope that heated it at least he hoped it was hope and not the first episode of night sweats elizabeth put a hand out and gently touched his arm god only knows she said softly theres always a chance jeremy always and youre a nonprogressor every day every month that you hold out increases the chances of a cure and gives us more time to study you when we get back to the compound ill test your blood again she paused i wish we could bring her back and i wish the old ladys bibi would show up you know they tell me she cured one of the other villagers they say he was dying of aids that cant be true of course but id still love to learn her methods dont tell me you believe in witch doctors asked jeremy with a smile i dont believe in all the superstition that goes along with it but some of these folk healers have stumbled on medicines that are new to science there are plants that no one has classified yet and its a fair bet that some of them will be effective against certain diseases theres a nobel prize waiting for the scientist who brings back the right plants she stared at the fire yes i wish i could convince the old woman to introduce me to this bibi of hers who knows what we might learn from her maybe after a few days when they see we dont mean any harm began jeremy they already know that jeremy said elizabeth half of them have been to the camp at one time or another she poked at the fire with the stick silent for awhile a sudden chorus of warning screams and barks from a troop of baboons told them that a leopard was in the neighborhood the noise continued for a couple of minutes growing gradually softer as the troop retreated higher up their trees and the leopard decided to seek other prey jeremy fumbled again for the letter in his pocket brought it out stared at the oncefamiliar handwriting for perhaps the tenth time that day and began to tuck it back into the pocket youre driving me crazy with that letter snapped elizabeth either read the bloody thing or throw it into the fire i dont feel like reading it said jeremy then ill read it she said snatching it from him she bent over and began reading aloud by firelight dear jeremy after i stopped shaking and walked out on you and got back to the keys bud wanted to head north after you with his ak but steve said what the fuck bud tested clean no point throwing away his life along with yours and mine and steves hes real sick arc pneumonia he calls it arclight bombing when hes got enough breath to talk ive moved in with the two of them to try to help out money goes farther that way and i like to think im useful its hard to watch him come apart and know this is how im going to end up then i think its how youre going to end up too and its not so bad for once youre not going to be able to weasel your way out of something only you call it negotiating dont you its part of that important stuff like attention to detail and execution that makes you such a big success on the street wall that is not nd where they sell themselves another way not much difference is there when you come right down to it talk about execution youve sure executed the two of us like a pro we can fight this you said maybe you can turn whats left of your life into a holy crusade against this thing you gave me me i just want to live what years ive got left in a way i envy steve hes out of it now and hes got bud with him i dont know what budll do after he goes write maybe im using his computer dont mind the spelling mistakes buds trying to get some rest and if he knew i was writing to you hed probably pitch a fit why in hell are you bothering hed ask for one thing i want you to know what youve done and i wanted to return these cufflinks to you bud was all for pawning them sending you the ticket and throwing one hell of a party but that was always your job wasnt it with your platinum card easy come easy go right i dont want to drink your booze and i dont want my friends to either and i dont want to keep these things around i saw the catalog you ordered them from karat gold i know what you paid you must have been out of your mind you want to look right you said you belong here you belong with me dammit if i belonged with you why didnt you ever bring me home i saw that picture of your folks you hide in your desk they look nice your father hes a big guy maybe big enough to take in another son maybe he even valued the one he had you never mind the clone you stitched up out of bits of grad school f scott fitzgerald and the new yorker or whatever the hell instead tiffany cufflinks and the bloody hamptons and why dont i move up to the city from the keys fulltime and take the goddamned series and youd help me find a job then i could dress up and go to banquets for greg louganis or something with you and get my name on program committees and if you died first then id be the right kind of person to be written up as companion of in the new york times obituary section with all the other guys who are dying too damn young no thanks you said i was the best thing that ever happened to you but that wasnt good enough you had to play around and go test positive for hiv and give that to me too careless thats what you are stupidly killingly careless like the rules dont apply to you i saw how your friends act when youre not looking or maybe you dont care they stiff waiters they cut lines they shout at people on the phones people who cant shout back because they need their jobs you probably even barged into the doctors for your blood test ahead of six other people who had to wait even longer because you were there and you were important well its going to get you too jeremy harris just like its getting the guy with tb on the street corner wishing to hell he was dying down here where its warm besides i want to return the cufflinks because i dont want to get to the point where i have to pawn them and use the money i wasnt smart like you at making money never had all that much with luck when i go ill go quick if not i plan to be somewhere warm somewhere maybe people will take care of me thats why i left new york when steves gone ill probably head even farther south if i had folks i was alive to id go home to them maybe not hide their picture it doesnt matter a whole hell of a lot state of mind is important though thats what steves doctors said when they sent him home were not hoping for a miracle cure he hasnt got a whole lot of time left and no one knows that better than he does but hes happier with his partner around and his garden and his boat in sight we hauled it out in front of his window he can hear the ocean and sometimes when hes able to eat one of us goes and catches him a fish so heres the cufflinks keep em throw em away or pay tiffanys to change the monogram for the next sucker no use wasting good stuff steve just woke up got to go in a minute bud yelled in from his room if youre writing to jeremy tell the sonofabitch to get a life you had one you threw it away it couldnt happen to you you were important you were privileged well it did and now youve thrown away my life too get a life for as long as you can thats what i plan to do so im going to live as much as i can first im taking care of steve did you ever help anyone up close im not talking about writing checks and handing out cufflinks its kind of a mess only helping someone whos that sick makes you feel its like you respect yourself you know i didnt for awhile there you were paying the bills i had to go along i thought but i hated it dont try to get in touch this isnt something you can negotiate until you talk me around i know youre better at it than i am thing is as long as i dont see you i can remember the good things but if i see you i know ill get mad all over again and scared just like when i first heard and i prayed for a heart attack right then and there so i wouldnt have to go through what i know lies up ahead dont look for me dont even think about me you know the old line i could tell you but then id have to kill you right now i think that if i saw you id kill you or die trying and thered go the few years ive got left im not willing to throw them away too get a life jeremy if you know how raymond elizabeth stopped her eyes glittering in the firelight she was silent for a long time then she looked up i dont know what to say maybe now you understand why i didnt want to know what was in it he said bitterly its a terrible burden to carry she acknowledged but youre not the only one this has happened to thats a damned arrogant thing to say at least you were able to come back here she moved abruptly then stopped it was as if she wanted to take his letter and his idiotic defensive statement and toss the whole lot into the fire i didnt mean to come back alone i wasnt alone in paris ever i could have had anyone bankers oil men frenchmen whose blood was so blue it was a wonder they could still breathe she sighed what i chose was paul that was his western name the one he used in medical school he was an ibo jeremy shut his eyes as he considered this revelation achole and ibo elizabeth would have had about as much in common with paul as if shed been a nice jewish girl who fell in love with moammar quadafi sorry he muttered at this rate hed have to make a tape or something jeremy harris his greatest apologies and play it as needed a hippo grunted much closer than before and jeremy peered into the dark trying to spot it with no success they werent carnivores but they killed a lot of people who got in their way at nights elizabeth spat on the ground all the chic all the european gone from her for a moment we had such plans he was going to establish the best medical clinic in africa and i would be a highprofile spokeswoman or fundraiser probably both we were going to be a bridge between the nations paul and i and since he was the man and that counts for more than you can imagine on this continent we set up shop in his country she sighed and her shoulders looked bony not elegant not any more i tried i did my best i stuck it out long enough to be called a useless achole bitch by him by everyone including him jeremy wanted to reach for the letter but managed to control himself then what i applied to medical school myself my olevels were good id taken a first in university given harvards admission policies i knew i could get in as a special student then move on to med school when i was done i took my money and built the relief camp and cajoled a few doctors into coming back to uganda and sold space to a few people like you who were willing to pay to work here for whatever their personal reasons she paused it was important to me when the camp became a reality i collected all my clippings and sent them to paul where is he now nigeria or maybe hell for all i know theres not much difference between the two i read last month that theres yet another revolution there maybe theyll shoot him this time again she poked at the fire jeremy watched her face in the flickering firelight all i ever saw before tonight was the models looks and the cool competent exterior he mused i guess were all of us trapped inside our bodies even someone as beautiful and accomplished as elizabeth nigeria will do just fine without him she concluded after a long silence it doesnt need a savior she stared into the fire again i just wish i knew why uganda is cursed ugandas not unique replied jeremy all the african countries have aids were unique she said adamently first amin then the other butchers and now this you know kenya has a high hiv incidence almost as high as ours but their people arent dying like ours ive even heard former colonials in nairobi sitting at their lilywhite bars and restaurants complaining about it they thought aids would return kenya to them but hardly anyones dying and they feel cheated and here right next door in the most beautiful fertile land on the continent were lost entire villages a look of fury spread across her face its just not fair maybe we should learn from other countries instead of resenting them said jeremy while deep within him a tiny voice protested in outrage their time will come she replied what we need is more information sooner or later were going to find out what it is about nonprogressors that makes them fight the disease better sooner or later were going to find someone with natural immunity god help the poor sucker said jeremy youll make a lab rat out of him for sure a rich lab rat a celebrity lab rat thered be fortunes to be made from an aids vaccine if youd lost enough of your soul to charge what the market would bear the market of course being guys like him not women like the ones lying two huts over fighting off fever and the long defeat of their lives or her she replied who knows maybe this old womans mother is the one shes certainly lived long enough so where is she who knows elizabeth frowned ive been away a long time my clothings wrong my accents wrong even my magics wrong they dont trust me they sat in silence by the flickering firelight for a few more moments finally elizabeth yawned stretching like one of the children jeremy smiled at her im sorry that you hurt but i like you even better now that i know youre human maybe he and elizabeth could adopt each other or something he could be uncle jeremy to any children she would eventually have if he lived long enough to see her meet a man with more sense than paul not wisely but too well jeremy thought that went for both of them i really am going to bunk in the truck he said picking up his sleeping bag the huts too stuffy for me even if does get cold out here and this way i can keep an eye on things while youre sound asleep asked elizabeth hed rather hoped shed be too sleepy to be sarcastic good night he told her and trudged wearily toward the battered truck he spread out his bedding on the back of the truck if anything tried to get him hed at least hear it coming and he still had the pistol just in case jeremy jolted instantly awake his heart pounding his body drenched but this wasnt fever something was watching him he forced himself back into stillness keeping his eyes shut his hand hidden beneath his head gently released the safety on the pistol leopard or bandit or whatever whatever tried to attack him was going to be very very surprised and then very very dead steady there play possum he slowly opened his eyes when they adjusted to the darkness he glanced stealthily about a tiny blot of shadow detached itself from the doorway of the sick womans hut and paused staring at the truck dammit those kids had no business wandering around here at night hed seen the fence around the old mans grave maybe the local scavengers would like live meat for a change the children seemed eager to provide it you know perfectly well why their mothers cant watch the kids he told himself theyre sick or theyre dying probably both never mind what elizabeth had said about miracles the fact that her parents had survived the madness of idi amin had made her a cockeyed optimist hed give the kid five minutes jeremy decided five if it didnt do its business in the bush or wherever then go back into the hut he personally would escort it back to its mother wait dont move the shadow detached itself from the shelter of the hut and moved out into the clearing toward the fencedin grave it squatted there and jeremy could see the tremors that shook it no shook her had one of the little ones been a girl he couldnt remember thered been so many children each to be greeted with a grin and a loop of scarlet ribbon as long as supplies held out that sometimes he didnt look at them as the individuals they were or that they would grow into if they lucked out and lived this was a girl barely four feet tall much too small to be out alone he gathered himself to leap down from the truck and take the child in charge not yet the childs shoulders shook why shes crying for her father jeremys own eyes filled he blinked frantically and when his sight cleared he found that the child had turned around and it was no child it had the face of a withered old woman with eyes that seemed filled with love and compassion this is crazy africas finally got to me i must be hallucinating how can you look at a pair of eyes especially in that ancient face and read compassion or anything else into them a cough came from the darkness of the forest a cough and a rush of paws followed by a squall of pure rage as the child with the ancient face beat at the predator with a club finally jeremy could make out her attacker a small scrawny leopard made bold by its hunger no time for waiting now jeremy grabbed for the pistol aimed as best he could and fired the explosion woke up the village jeremy built a huge fire and reconnoitered pursued by elizabeths ironic comments about mighty hunters a trail of blood and pawprints led back to the bush and vanished there upon returning he insisted on seeing all the children and counting them and trying fruitlessly to determine which of them had been the one that had beaten off the leopard gradually the infants stopped screaming the sick woman in the hut stopped moaning for bibi she even consented to drink some broth and put on a tshirt that had been donated by elizabeth finally the village quieted down and went back to sleep after a long long while so did jeremy if anyone ventured outside he didnt hear it or anything else in the morning he found that the trucks radio and spark plugs were missing why would anyone take them he asked elizabeth its not as if this was telephone wire or something they could use for ornaments the radios no good to anyone without a power source and the plugs are totally useless unless someone thought theyd look cute stuck through his ears he paused if they dont turn up were in deep shit no transportation and no way of calling for help all we can do is ask replied elizabeth wearily she walked over to the old womans hut and entered it good morning she said with a smile as the old woman looked up from the daughterinlaw she had been tending jambo memsaab responded the woman that is a very formal greeting i would much rather you called me elizabeth but you are always formal and dont call me by my name the old woman pointed out i apologize maroka said elizabeth i did not mean to offend i am sure you did not maroka reached out and touched elizabeths arm gently you are a good person elizabeth elizabeth finally looked down at the younger woman and almost did a doubletake her eyes were alert and animated and she was no longer covered with sweat elizabeth reached out a hand feeling for signs of the fever and finding none has she eaten yes elizabeth answered maroka she has had posho and milk she asked for pombe but i decided she should not have any until tomorrow elizabeth examined the young woman for another few minutes then straightened up its amazing she said at last my medicine has never been able to do this before your medicine did not save her said maroka it was bibis magic bibi came here last night asked elizabeth yes where is she now hiding answered maroka she is shy of strangers she will be back after you have left elizabeth glanced out the door wondering where bibi might be then her eyes fell on the truck and she remembered the purpose of her visit there is a problem maroka she said this morning we have found that certain things are missing from the truck we must have them back or the truck will not run a monkey took them elizabeth suggested maroka or perhaps a baboon why do you say that because you have many other villages to visit and nobody in this village would want to keep you from your work we know it is important elizabeth frowned in a culture where no one ever spoke harshly or said anything unpleasant marokas answer was the closest she would come to because we dont want you here and would never do anything to keep you from leaving we still have food and medicine to give you said elizabeth we have food so it is best that your food go to a less fortunate village replied maroka and we have no need of your medicine bibis magic is much stronger i really want to meet her said elizabeth and learn about her magic i think she is afraid of you please help me said elizabeth earnestly she is an old woman who will probably never travel ten miles from here whatever magic she performs is needed all across uganda maroka paused and considered what she had heard that is true she said at last i will tell her what you said elizabeth thank you but i do not think she will come please ask her anyway said elizabeth she inspected the younger woman one more time and then left the hut she rejoined jeremy who was still rummaging under the hood of the truck searching for further damage well he asked does she know where our spark plugs and radio are i cant be sure but i dont think so said elizabeth it took you fifteen minutes to come to that conclusion he asked sardonically it took fifteen seconds she said the rest of the time we talked about medicine or magic i dont follow you that young woman the one i thought would be dead by today is one hundred percent better what did you give her asked jeremy nothing i havent given hundreds of other patients said elizabeth frowning im thrilled that shes recovering but everything i know about medicine says she shouldnt be and they think its magic asked jeremy even though they saw you administer the medications evidently bibi came by last night and laid a spell on her said elizabeth a spell elizabeth shrugged a leaf a plant some kind of flower i dont know what but marokas convinced that shes the one who saved the young woman elizabeth frowned hell for all i know marokas right thats why i want to find her even more than i want to find our spark plugs if this woman has stumbled on some kind of miracle cure i want to know about it maybe theyre right said jeremy maybe it is magic nonsense she snapped theres no such thing oh i dont know said jeremy to create penicillin out of bread mold seems like magic to me or to take a piece of silicon and make it think faster and more accurately than a man thats magic too youre too concerned with process elizabeth when its the result that counts if the old ladys mother can cure people by magic or any other means id bring her a batch of sick people instead of trying to steal her secrets i dont like what youre accusing me of jeremy said elizabeth sharply all i want to know is what shes doing to make them well if indeed shes doing anything at all and then i want to find out how to synthesize it bottle it and distribute it maybe it cant be done you give me the facts and ill do it to quote don quixote facts are the enemies of truth thats romantic drivel said elizabeth facts are all there is not around here he replied oh he smiled ask the villagers theres magic too are you trying to be argumentative she demanded some unseen old lady may be going around curing people of aids answered jeremy all youre concerned with is how she does it and all im concerned with is getting her to do it again now if thats argumentative no replied elizabeth thoughtfully no i suppose it isnt really youve got a vested interest in being cured ive got one in finding out how to cure people our approaches are bound to differ i grew up on peter pan and mother goose and mowgli and oz and you grew up with facts and figures and slaughtered villages replied jeremy of course our approaches are different you simply will not understand she said irritably no he admitted but show me a cure and i might believe she angrily turned away from him and strode off into the village where a clap of her hands summoned all the children from their huts those few who were wearing clothes twisted them as they stood in a ragged uneasy line expecting the worst from the two strangers one white and one black all right believer said elizabeth to jeremy you can tell them what we lost it would be a stretch in kitchen swahili but walking back to the relief camp was a far less attractive alternative a few adults gathered around to chuckle in amusement at jeremys awkward descriptions of the things that were missing the childrens eyes simply widened and they looked from one to another then elizabeth walked up and down the row of children studying each in turn finally she stopped before the tallest of the boys who had long since outgrown his michael jordan tshirt and was wearing a filthy tattered muhammed ali tshirt from another era you know dont you she said i can see it on your face you know who took those things the boys bare feet scuffed in the dust he muttered something i cant hear you said elizabeth bibi took them his mother interjected jeremy puzzled perhaps answered elizabeth in formal swahili bibi can also mean grandmother you mean maroka asked jeremy surprised there were indignant protests from the healthier of the two wives who had come out to watch from maroka there was only a haughty lift of the head elizabeth turned back to the child i want you to tell me where our things are we cant go home without them more sidelong wary glances child to child elizabeth left the boy and stopped in front of a girl who was no more than six or seven years old she didnt say a word just stared at her the girl kicked the red dirt nervously with her bare feet and refused to meet elizabeths gaze do you know elizabeth finally asked her she said not to tell who said not to tell and why the little girl looked up and then spoke in a rush bibi she says your hearts are good because you wish to help but she also says if we stayed in your village we would have all gotten sicker if we had left earlier my father would still be alive but thats not true protested elizabeth bibi says it is said the girl staring unblinking into elizabeths eyes elizabeth kept trying but after a few minutes it became obvious that the children would not disobey bibi and reveal where the missing parts were hidden elizabeth exchanged a quick frustrated glance with jeremy beautiful uganda land of my people where no good deed goes unpunished she murmured jeremy was almost as depressed as he had been when the results of his initial bloodwork had come back radios if mistreated could be cranky and there was a limit to the trucks ability to sit outside without maintenance let it be exceeded and even if they found their equipment theyd still be stranded in this tiny village well said elizabeth i may as well make my morning rounds she grimaced in jeremys direction are you ready for an un scientific opinion its my favorite kind personally i think this whole goddamned village needs to have its collective head examined the day passed uneventfully and as the huge sun went down jeremy summoned the energy from somewhere to gather wood for a fire the children were busy gathering firewood and water and putting the chickens in their coops which would be hung from nearby trees jeremy watched elizabeths friendly overtures met with polite coolness as the villagers decided that black skin and a knowledge of buganda did not make her one of them he considered the missing equipment for the hundredth time they couldnt count on anyone arriving here except by accident they had to persuade the thief to give back the radio and the spark plugs elizabeth emerged from a hut and walked over to join jeremy i must have misdiagnosed that woman she said puzzled she showed all the classic signs and i thought her fever would finish her off in a matter of hours but shes no more an aids victim than i am hell even that case of thrush she had is clearing up she shook her head maroka wants to make her sit up tomorrow i suppose shes right the sooner shes back on her feet the better who will watch her until she can go back out in the fields elizabeth shrugged we still havent seen bibi given her age thatd be a good job for her she paused you know thats another reason id like to get out of here the poor things so scared of us shes hiding out in the bush i didnt come here to turn some poor woman out of her house and put her at the mercy of the hyenas she seemed about to say something more then changed her mind and headed off to her sleeping hut darkness descended and jeremy soon fell asleep on the back of the truck when he woke in the morning the crimson ribbon was missing from his shirt interesting he climbed down swallowed his pills cut himself a fresh ribbon and put the muchdiminished spool into a hip pocket just in case and suddenly he knew that he was being watched he found himself glancing over his shoulder watching the long sharp shadows in case some tiny fragment broke off from one of them and headed for the truck or the fields or the deep bush when he paused to wipe his face after splashing it with some water the sense of being watched grew even stronger once or twice he caught a flicker of motion on the far side of a clearing at the edge of his vision marokas bibi he hadnt gotten a good look at her but he couldnt imagine who else it could be he set off across the clearing and soon spotted some footprints in the dust they were small enough to be the prints of a child but they were deep as if the person they belonged to was carrying something heavy they led him deeper and deeper into the bush soon the vegetation had closed around him he could hear the chirping of birds and the buzzing of insects but the only motion he could see was the slight swaying of leaves in the hot breeze he could almost imagine that he was some stoneage man pushing his way through the bush in pursuit of his dinner surely the terrain hadnt looked much different even a million years ago a hyena giggled in the distance in jeremys mind it became a pound hyenadon a vulture circled lazily overhead he pretended it was a pteradactyl he was still imagining a distant past and a more physically imposing version of himself when suddenly he came upon a clearing a huge dead tree had fallen down he imagined that a mastodon had pushed it over and a nearby termite mound towered some twenty feet above the ground then suddenly he became aware of a cluster of children and saw the baby in the arms of what looked like another child that is it looked like another child until he got a glimpse of its wizened face it was a female no question about it for she was nursing the infant her skin seemed incredibly ancient not so much lined as engraved with seams the sparse hair surrounding it growing far down on her low brow was white but the smile on her lips as she looked down at the baby was very beautiful and oddly familiar ive seen you before i know i have but where jeremy took a step toward her a dry twig snapped beneath his foot and a dozen birds burst from cover while overhead a family of colobus monkeys began shrieking the woman with the ancient face jumped startled then she laid the baby down on a piece of red cloth and fled into the bush the infant deprived of his milk promptly began howling come on bibi he wanted to yell after her can a sick skinny american be that frightening by the time jeremy had helped soothe the infant placing it in the eldest girls arms and coaxing all of them to believe he wasnt some sort of monster just because the old woman had fled he had gotten his thoughts and his memory in order one summer just for a change he had rented a place on nantucket not the hamptons a shabby ramshackle desirable home that had cost him a bundle it had been a good summer and he hadnt begrudged a cent of it despite about a week of rainy days along with the seafood the sailing and the whale watching hed had the whole old house to prowl through and in its attic hed found treasure indeed thirty years worth of national geographics hed loved that magazine ever since he was a child in fact hed dreamed of being an explorer maybe even a paleontologist or geochronologist until his uncle sid the executive vice president sat him down and explained the facts of life to him student loans grants bottom lines the best way probably the only way to participate in these expeditions was to fund them so hed packed the dream away but hed kept up his subscription to national geographic joined the nature conservancy and always made donations to the american museum of natural history they were good causes and taxdeductible but the real reason was that he loved them now those yellowed covers and fragile pages riffled in his imagination and he remembered dr donald johansons discovery of australopithecus afarensis some million years old she was mankinds ancestor a tiny female johanson had called lucy after the beatles record his staff had played incessantly during the dig and now he had seen her not as a mummified corpse or a pile of white bones either hed seen her as a living breathing being nursing her greattothenthpowergrandchild he even knew her name bibi while everyone else was celebrating the miraculouslyrecovered young womans emergence from the hut in which she was expected to die jeremy wandered over to the truck and picked up his bait a bowl of posho and some dried fruits there was no sense telling elizabeth what he had seen or what he planned to do about it she would give him so many rational explanations that he would have ended up believing her and not trying to entice the ancient woman back so while elizabeth lay deeply asleep within the hut jeremy laid out his traps on the back of the truck then stretched out right beside them he forced himself to close his eyes moonlight would reflect off them and it stood to reason that the superior senses of australopithecus pitheca would spot it he waited and then it was morning and the fruit was gone it was her said jeremy to elizabeth i know it was then what are you going to do sleep out in the truck again he shook his head thats my turf and it makes her too cautious surely youre not going out into the bush at night you want your spark plugs back dont you he retorted not at the cost of your life ill be fine sure you will she said caustically if you dont get totally lost youll probably run into that leopard you shot hes out of the area replied jeremy how do you know the baboons are quiet at night she stared at him this is really stupid jeremy probably he agreed but unless you have a better idea she walked through the bush eyes and ears alert to any danger the animals were different from those she was used to smaller but just as dangerous she came to a small stream checked carefully for predators then squatted down cupped a hand and brought some of the lifegiving liquid to her lips a marabou stork landed a few feet away and she jumped her first urge now that she had satisfied her thirst was to return to the cave she had found where she would be safe for the night but then the wind brought the scent of fruit to her nostrils and she decided to investigate the moon had long set and he was on the verge of drowsing off his back against the thick bole of an acacia tree when he finally saw that small familiar figure steal out from a nearby bush across the clearing it paused to stare at him and jeremy forced himself to remain motionless tiny shadows swung from her neck as she came closer jeremy saw what it was she or one of the children she tended had strung the spark plugs on a grass string and she was wearing them as a necklace come on sweetheart he thought as his heart pounded he had spread his treasures out on the ground the red cloth in which the infant had been wrapped some dried apricots a bowl of posho a long loop of scarlet ribbon come on but the tiny creature paused suddenly frightened please he thought again this time imploringly please bibi the figure turned toward him lifting her head and straightening up which set the sparkplug necklace to swaying once again then attracted by the prizes hed set out she drew closer she recognized the cloth and snatched it to her breast cradling it like an infant she caught up a dried apricot and chewed it quickly her eyes shining with pleasure then she reached for the strand of crimson ribbon jeremy laid his hand down on the other end of the ribbon bibi jumped back jeremy leaned forward carefully she had seen him with the women and children she had to know that he wasnt a threat still she watched him carefully never taking her eyes from his never loosing her grip upon the ribbon thats right think of the necklace you can make think of how itll delight the kids come on he whispered to her as he got slowly carefully to his feet would she understand any speech at all of course you want it its pretty ill trade you this for he waved at the spark plug necklace in a gesture of lets barter that might have been old when she was young the ancient woman backed away smart arent you why bargain if you can get it for free he tugged lightly on the length of ribbon trying to draw it toward him and her with it she let herself be drawn and looked up into his face he was struck by her eyes even under the low furrowed brow they glowed with intelligence this was not a primate this was a person he smiled at her and she smiled back youve seen me im your friend i shot the leopard i really need those spark plugs he said softly he leaned over cautiously maintaining the tension on the red ribbon he was six feet tall to her four a little further a little longer and his fingers closed on her arm he was strong especially compared to her but she was wily even as she squalled with anger she let him draw her closer and then with a smile of glee at her own cunning she buried her sturdy threemillionyearold teeth deep in his arm jeremy let out a yelp of surprise and pain human bites were as nasty as those of the big cats hed heard and even dirtier but this bite burned like molten iron goddammit i thought youd come to save your children not kill them are we that disappointing to you and then came a frightening thought god help me ive contaminated her he realized that he was bleeding like the proverbial stuck pig his arm was swelling and the moonlight shone off some nasty red streaks had started to travel from the wound up toward his lymph nodes he could hear his teeth chattering as he burned and shivered and tried to use his belt as a tourniquet why bibi you cant have come across the endless eons just to bite a man whos already dying it doesnt make any sense then he blacked out the sky glittered as if it were filled with diamonds more diamonds or maybe sapphires reflected off the brilliant surface of the lake or maybe it was an ocean a white wake bisected it and ripples shimmered then evened out as the water calmed jeremy thrashed he wanted to tell everyone that it was a good sign that the water was troubled it meant that spirits were abroad or afloat or something anyhow it meant that miracles could indeed happen even to him his arm burned he ached all over and his mouth tasted as if bats had roosted in it he thrashed and felt weights land on him forcing him back down he opened his eyes and saw bibi the infinitely loving mother of the race up in that glittering sky surrounded by a rainbow haze that turned into crystals even as he watched then dropped down in showers of gems lucy in the sky with diamonds and i thought it was just a song hed been young once without this treason in his blood and body and hed waterskiied in the keys with guys as carefree as he himself hed linked arms and chanted the whole worlds watching so it was and bibi was watching too her ugly beautiful infinitely loving face grave with concern if you get sick come home his parents had written and well take care of you thats just what ive done he wanted to say ive come home and the mother of us all is taking care of me then he fell into a restless sleep in which he was walking walking always walking he was walking not merely across the millennia but across goddamned millions of years toward someone who had cried out in pain toward a lot of someones and he thought his heart would break from the effort and the sorrow jeremy awoke shivering as three women sponged him down a childs voice piped up like rock music when the lead singer goes falsetto he heard a cuff and a cry and the child was out of there in the muted grey light of a dawn he had never expected to see he found elizabeth umurungis troubled eyes much reddened watching him if he doesnt come out of this now he expected her to say instead he could lipread the words of the rosary he cried at her sorrow he imagined that someone took his hand in a warm grip unlike any he had ever known it drew him back across the years across the gulf of sickness fear and death out of the place where the sky dropped diamonds and back into the familiar smells and sounds of the tiny village flies buzzed overhead butting up against the huts thatched ceiling jeremy wrinkled his nose at the reek of antiseptic so totally at odds with the homelier smells of animal dung human sweat and cooking fires not far away water trickled into a metal basin god he was so thirsty he tried to ask for water something between a croak and a whimper emerged from lips that cracked open with the effort another voice echoed his someone went to the door and called shouts that might have been cheers sounded from outside hes coming around good stay with him his eyes were so thoroughly gummed shut that it seemed to take an hour to open them he flexed his fingers still all there what about his other arm the one bibi had bitten experimentally he moved it and flinched i wouldnt try that said elizabeth youve been pretty sick bit of a reaction to the rabies vaccine or maybe the tetanus the what maybe you can help me out continued elizabeth i dont know what got you i just know i found you swelling up like a balloon blood oozing from your arm and nothing in sight it was bibi dont be ridiculous said elizabeth it was bibi and she didnt do it to hurt me whispered jeremy weakly rubbish youll see said jeremy ask her yourself why in the world would she come back here especially if she bit you because shes worried about her son youre not her son replied elizabeth patiently as if speaking to a child we are all her children rasped jeremy somehow she felt our pain knew we were in trouble and through means well never understand she did what any mother would do she came to help us jeremy youve been delerious youre still not thinking rationally said elizabeth shes an old woman thats all possibly a bit retarded and shes probably mute the children told me she used some form of sign language when she spoke to them she can speak said jeremy with absolute conviction its just that no one can understand her language oh said elizabeth sardonically just what language does she speak i dont know murmured jeremy it hasnt been heard in three million years youre sicker than i thought she said as he passed out again when he awoke he felt good more than good he felt better than hed felt in years for the first time since hed contracted the virus he felt ready to get up and seize the day and then suddenly the revelation hit him he tried to sit up but found he didnt have the strength a child looked in saw him struggling and called elizabeth what on earth is the matter with you jeremy she asked as she entered the hut nothing he said absolutely nothing she stared at him puzzled dont you understand he said excitedly theres nothing wrong with me what are you talking about as soon as we get back to camp i want you to run another blood test on me she looked at him as if she expected him to foam at the mouth momentarily you dont seriously believe that youre no longer hiv positive do you just test me his voice reflecting his absolute conviction theres never been a single recorded case of a spontaneous cure jeremy its not spontaneous jeremy said excitedly and no one records cures out here in the bush she cured me just like shes cured so many others thats what shes here for and just how do you think this old illiterate woman who is totally ignorant of all medicine and technology cured your incurable disease she bit me you mean all i had to do all these months was bite you and youd have become hiv negative said elizabeth sarcastially no she had to do it she undoubtedly bit you because you scared her a feeling of overwhelming fatigue swept over him and he lay back on his pillow i feel very sorry for you he said you feel sorry for me she repeated why because you know too many facts and too little truth he said as he struggled to remain awake youll test my blood and because you dont believe in bibi youll take two or three more samples before you acknowledge what your tests tell you he could almost feel a rough calloused hand run tenderly through his hair as he dropped off to sleep once more jeremy was outside chopping firewood working up a sweat and feeling great about it when elizabeth called him over to her hut what is it he asked when he arrived she held up the spark plugs strung together on a thread of scarlet ribbon what happened i left some costume jewelry outside the hut said elizabeth she came during the night and accepted the trade she grimaced they cost me a cultured pearl necklace and a silverplated bracelet i think both sides made a good trade said jeremy he looked across the village past all the huts toward the bush thank you bibi i will probably never see you again but i owe you my life and i will dedicate it to helping your other children they had been back in camp for a day jeremy had put in a long morning tending patients and passing out food and was sitting on a camp chair just outside his tent reading a monthold copy of the new yorker when elizabeth appeared i tested your blood she announced and i couldnt culture hiv from your blood if i had all the resources of the mayo clinic here she paused and stared at him you got your miracle jeremy youre clean hiv negative suddenly tears welled up and spilled down his cheeks for just an instant he thought he could feel bibis hand tighten around his a mother reassuring a child who has been desperately ill i told you he said at last i didnt believe you then and i dont believe you now answered elizabeth but whoever and whatever she is shes worth her weight in gold to us she paused thoughtfully shes why they said that kabute wouldnt have died if they could have gotten him back home because she was there waiting for him and shes probably why we saw that fatally ill womans lesions shrink and the thrush go away jeremy grinned probably hell of course it was her and now im going to live im going to live forever and ever the next morning was cool and clear and they decided to eat breakfast outside the crackling of the eggs and bacon frying attracted a small troop of vervet monkeys and a black african kite swooped down from a limb above the fire and swiped a piece of bread right out of jeremys hand theyre such rogues said elizabeth as the kite flew away with its prize well its nice to know that something on this continent isnt endangered remarked jeremy she watched the kite for another moment then turned to jeremy ive been giving bibi a lot of thought and asked jeremy weve got to go back and find her answered elizabeth id kill for the chance to have aids researchers examine her i still dont know that i buy your story about her curing you with a bite but whatever happened she obviously gave you some biochemical agent that kills the hiv virus she looked at jeremy wryly itll never replace the salk vaccine but theres simply no other explanation ive got to find her and bring her to the camp shes not a lab animal replied jeremy seriously shes got to remain free to do her job her job she has other children to cure youre not a child were all her children that again said elizabeth with a sigh you dont have to believe it said jeremy protecting his bacon as the kite swooped down toward his plate its enough that i do youre not being logical jeremy i was logical my whole life and what did it get me except some money i dont need and an incurable disease replied jeremy why dont you really look at uganda sometime this is a magical place for all its problems spit a mango pit out the window of your land rover and when you drive by six months later a mango tree has grown up amin and his successors virtually wiped out your wildlife yet all the animals are returning terminally ill people suddenly get cured so how can i not believe in magic theres nothing magical about bibi i think there is said jeremy leave her alone i cant protested elizabeth not until ive studied her and found out how she does it we may never find anything like her again think of her he said what kind of life do you think shed have shuttling from clinic to clinic facing all those vampires in white coats that not even a mother could love he paused let her stay in the bush these people wont tell besides you have me a certified hivnegative volunteer at your disposal he stared unblinking into her deep brown eyes let her go elizabeth you know i cant we could save millions of people she zeroed in for the kill or isnt that important to you now that youve been cured you know thats not true he snapped heatedly he was going to say more tell her how unfair that statement was how no true friend would ever even suggest it but a little voice in his head intervened could she be right am i just pretending to believe in bibis powers do i really feel now that im cured that no one else matters he searched his soul which he had not done for a long time because he hadnt especially liked what he had found there this time he couldnt find what he was afraid might be lurking in its darker recesses well i know its a lie he thought with satisfaction no sense trying to convince you too all i know is that were going to dig ten more graves tomorrow morning responded elizabeth and ten the day after that and ten the day after that and were going to keep digging them until weve either beaten this disease or every last victim has died now heres a woman who may just may have a cure for it do you really think i can let her go he stared at her for a very long moment no he said softly i know you cant then come with me while i search for her continued elizabeth she helped you maybe she wont be so frightened if she sees that youre with me he stared at his plate for a long moment considering his answer the kite hovered overhead and finally settled for a scrap of bacon that had fallen in the dirt by the fire all right ill come he said at last but we wont find her what makes you think so because youre antithetical to her shes magic brought forth from the spirit of this land and youre science and logic and doubt educated thousands of miles away science will save a lot more people than she can once i find out just what it is that she does said elizabeth he shook his head sadly you still dont see do you see what science needs her said jeremy she doesnt need science never has never will he sighed deeply you and she are oil and water and your worlds touch only briefly in passing thats why youll never find her well see said elizabeth grimly they spent the next three months following up every rumor every imagined sighting of an old woman who performed feats of medical magic they scoured the virunga volcanos and came away emptyhanded they thought they found her tracks in the foothills of the mountains of the moon but they never saw her they stopped back at camp only long enough to take on fresh supplies then went to the arid semidesert in the north of the karamojong country and west to the aptlynamed impenetrable forest they spent a week at murchisons falls only to discover that the old lady they were tracking was a buganda witch woman who was missing an eye and part of an ear everywhere they went they questioned the local people far from showing the symptoms of the thinning disease almost all of them glowed with health and fervently denied ever having seen anyone who remotely resembled bibi jeremy got the distinct impression that they were secretly laughing at the two relief workers finally elizabeth admitted defeat and returned to camp jeremy tended the sick and the dying for another week and then asked to see her privately well she said when the two of them were alone in her tent ive made up my mind he announced im leaving you mean youre going home he shook his head no im staying in uganda then i dont understand all were doing here is prolonging doomed lives said jeremy i came here to save some suddenly elizabeths eyes widened with comprehension youre going out after bibi thats right but weve just spent three months looking for her what makes you think you can find her he didnt want to answer that for fear of hurting her but finally he did ill be alone you think that makes a difference she said caustically yes i do okay so you cant be hurt if you dont believe youre a fool she snapped where will you go in what direction will you look how will you feed yourself ill get by he said and i wont have to find her shell find me youll starve to death or run into a leopard or a hyena or drink the wrong water or eat the wrong food said elizabeth you cant survive alone in the bush i didnt realize you thought so little of me he said wryly its because i think so much of you that i dont want you dead its my decision and if aids cant kill me neither will anything else this land has to offer he withdrew a handwritten document and placed it on her table this turns over all my investments to the camp suddenly he grinned the notary publics hut wasnt open for business today but i think itll stand up in court elizabeth walked to the door of the tent and looked out at the busy camp then turned back to jeremy youre giving everything up for a dream wont you reconsider he shook his head if i reconsidered i might agree that it was nothing but a dream and stay here and then id miss the chance to help her perform her magic we dont need magic she replied impatiently if this crisis is solved it will be solved by science to me its all magic and whos to say that yours is any more potent than theirs science couldnt cure me but bibi could damn it jeremy youre chasing a willothewisp shes just an old woman not some mythical creature with awesome powers of healing she cured me with a bite he said how can i not believe in that we dont know that thats what cured you insisted elizabeth she could have administered any number of medications while you were delerious she could have he agreed but she didnt elizabeth paused and look at him sadly isnt there anything i can say yes he replied say good luck she was still staring at him silently as he left her tent bibi walked through the bush senses alert to the hidden presence of predators there were so many children far more than she dreamed possible she could feel their cries their hunger their pain and she knew that she had much work to do before she could rest again suddenly she heard a twig break and she crouched ready to race to safety a man was approaching noisily making no attempt to hide his presence frightening birds and monkeys with every step her first inclination was to run but some secret instinct made her stay and then she saw a familiar face a face that reflected the unselfish love that was written across her own hi mom said the man holding a dried apricot out to her ive brought you a present
