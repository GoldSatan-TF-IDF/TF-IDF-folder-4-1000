rob roy advertisement to the first edition when the editor of the following volumes published about two years since the work called the antiquary he announced that he was for the last time intruding upon the public in his present capacity he might shelter himself under the plea that every anonymous writer is like the celebrated junius only a phantom and that therefore although an apparition of a more benign as well as much meaner description he cannot be bound to plead to a charge of inconsistency a better apology may be found in the imitating the confession of honest benedict that when he said he would die a bachelor he did not think he should live to be married the best of all would be if as has eminently happened in the case of some distinguished contemporaries the merit of the work should in the readers estimation form an excuse for the authors breach of promise without presuming to hope that this may prove the case it is only further necessary to mention that his resolution like that of benedict fell a sacrifice to temptation at least if not to stratagem it is now about six months since the author through the medium of his respectable publishers received a parcel of papers containing the outlines of this narrative with a permission or rather with a request couched in highly flattering terms that they might be given to the public with such alterations as should be found suitable as it maybe necessary in the present edition to speak upon the square the author thinks it proper to own that the communication alluded to is entirely imaginary these were of course so numerous that besides the suppression of names and of incidents approaching too much to reality the work may in a great measure be said to be new written several anachronisms have probably crept in during the course of these changes and the mottoes for the chapters have been selected without any reference to the supposed date of the incidents for these of course the editor is responsible some others occurred in the original materials but they are of little consequence in point of minute accuracy it may be stated that the bridge over the forth or rather the avondhu or black river near the hamlet of aberfoil had not an existence thirty years ago it does not however become the editor to be the first to point out these errors and he takes this public opportunity to thank the unknown and nameless correspondent to whom the reader will owe the principal share of any amusement which he may derive from the following pages st december introduction when the author projected this further encroachment on the patience of an indulgent public he was at some loss for a title a good name being very nearly of as much consequence in literature as in life the title of rob roy was suggested by the late mr constable whose sagacity and experience foresaw the germ of popularity which it included no introduction can be more appropriate to the work than some account of the singular character whose name is given to the titlepage and who through good report and bad report has maintained a wonderful degree of importance in popular recollection this cannot be ascribed to the distinction of his birth which though that of a gentleman had in it nothing of high destination and gave him little right to command in his clan neither though he lived a busy restless and enterprising life were his feats equal to those of other freebooters who have been less distinguished he owed his fame in a great measure to his residing on the very verge of the highlands and playing such pranks in the beginning of the th century as are usually ascribed to robin hood in the middle ages and that within forty miles of glasgow a great commercial city the seat of a learned university thus a character like his blending the wild virtues the subtle policy and unrestrained license of an american indian was flourishing in scotland during the augustan age of queen anne and george i addison it is probable or pope would have been considerably surprised if they had known that there existed in the same island with them a personage of rob roys peculiar habits and profession it is this strong contrast betwixt the civilised and cultivated mode of life on the one side of the highland line and the wild and lawless adventures which were habitually undertaken and achieved by one who dwelt on the opposite side of that ideal boundary which creates the interest attached to his name hence it is that even yet far and near through vale and hill are faces that attest the same and kindle like a fire new stirrd at sound of rob roys name there were several advantages which rob roy enjoyed for sustaining to advantage the character which he assumed the most prominent of these was his descent from and connection with the clan macgregor so famous for their misfortunes and the indomitable spirit with which they maintained themselves as a clan linked and banded together in spite of the most severe laws executed with unheardof rigour against those who bore this forbidden surname their history was that of several others of the original highland clans who were suppressed by more powerful neighbours and either extirpated or forced to secure themselves by renouncing their own family appellation and assuming that of the conquerors the peculiarity in the story of the macgregors is their retaining with such tenacity their separate existence and union as a clan under circumstances of the utmost urgency the history of the tribe is briefly as follows but we must premise that the tale depends in some degree on tradition therefore excepting when written documents are quoted it must be considered as in some degree dubious the sept of macgregor claimed a descent from gregor or gregorius third son it is said of alpin king of scots who flourished about hence their original patronymic is macalpine and they are usually termed the clan alpine an individual tribe of them retains the same name they are accounted one of the most ancient clans in the highlands and it is certain they were a people of original celtic descent and occupied at one period very extensive possessions in perthshire and argyleshire which they imprudently continued to hold by the coir a glaive that is the right of the sword their neighbours the earls of argyle and breadalbane in the meanwhile managed to leave the lands occupied by the macgregors engrossed in those charters which they easily obtained from the crown and thus constituted a legal right in their own favour without much regard to its justice as opportunity occurred of annoying or extirpating their neighbours they gradually extended their own domains by usurping under the pretext of such royal grants those of their more uncivilised neighbours a sir duncan campbell of lochow known in the highlands by the name of donacha dhu nan churraichd that is black duncan with the cowl it being his pleasure to wear such a headgear is said to have been peculiarly successful in those acts of spoliation upon the clan macgregor the devoted sept ever finding themselves iniquitously driven from their possessions defended themselves by force and occasionally gained advantages which they used cruelly enough this conduct though natural considering the country and time was studiously represented at the capital as arising from an untameable and innate ferocity which nothing it was said could remedy save cutting off the tribe of macgregor root and branch in an act of privy council at stirling d september in the reign of queen mary commission is granted to the most powerful nobles and chiefs of the clans to pursue the clan gregor with fire and sword a similar warrant in not only grants the like powers to sir john campbell of glenorchy the descendant of duncan with the cowl but discharges the lieges to receive or assist any of the clan gregor or afford them under any colour whatever meat drink or clothes an atrocity which the clan gregor committed in by the murder of john drummond of drummondernoch a forester of the royal forest of glenartney is elsewhere given with all its horrid circumstances the clan swore upon the severed head of the murdered man that they would make common cause in avowing the deed this led to an act of the privy council directing another crusade against the wicked clan gregor so long continuing in blood slaughter theft and robbery in which letters of fire and sword are denounced against them for the space of three years the reader will find this particular fact illustrated in the introduction to the legend of montrose in the present edition of these novels other occasions frequently occurred in which the macgregors testified contempt for the laws from which they had often experienced severity but never protection though they were gradually deprived of their possessions and of all ordinary means of procuring subsistence they could not nevertheless be supposed likely to starve for famine while they had the means of taking from strangers what they considered as rightfully their own hence they became versed in predatory forays and accustomed to bloodshed their passions were eager and with a little management on the part of some of their most powerful neighbours they could easily be hounded out to use an expressive scottish phrase to commit violence of which the wily instigators took the advantage and left the ignorant macgregors an undivided portion of blame and punishment this policy of pushing on the fierce clans of the highlands and borders to break the peace of the country is accounted by the historian one of the most dangerous practices of his own period in which the macgregors were considered as ready agents notwithstanding these severe denunciations which were acted upon in the same spirit in which they were conceived some of the clan still possessed property and the chief of the name in is designed allaster macgregor of glenstrae he is said to have been a brave and active man but from the tenor of his confession at his death appears to have been engaged in many and desperate feuds one of which finally proved fatal to himself and many of his followers this was the celebrated conflict at glenfruin near the southwestern extremity of loch lomond in the vicinity of which the macgregors continued to exercise much authority by the coir a glaive or right of the strongest which we have already mentioned there had been a long and bloody feud betwixt the macgregors and the laird of luss head of the family of colquhoun a powerful race on the lower part of loch lomond the macgregors tradition affirms that the quarrel began on a very trifling subject two of the macgregors being benighted asked shelter in a house belonging to a dependant of the colquhouns and were refused they then retreated to an outhouse took a wedder from the fold killed it and supped off the carcass for which it is said they offered payment to the proprietor the laird of luss seized on the offenders and by the summary process which feudal barons had at their command had them both condemned and executed the macgregors verify this account of the feud by appealing to a proverb current amongst them execrating the hour mult dhu an carbail ghil that the black wedder with the white tail was ever lambed to avenge this quarrel the laird of macgregor assembled his clan to the number of three or four hundred men and marched towards luss from the banks of loch long by a pass called raid na gael or the highlandmans pass sir humphrey colquhoun received early notice of this incursion and collected a strong force more than twice the number of that of the invaders he had with him the gentlemen of the name of buchanan with the grahams and other gentry of the lennox and a party of the citizens of dumbarton under command of tobias smollett a magistrate or bailie of that town and ancestor of the celebrated author the parties met in the valley of glenfruin which signifies the glen of sorrow a name that seemed to anticipate the event of the day which fatal to the conquered party was at least equally so to the victors the babe unborn of clan alpine having reason to repent it the macgregors somewhat discouraged by the appearance of a force much superior to their own were cheered on to the attack by a seer or secondsighted person who professed that he saw the shrouds of the dead wrapt around their principal opponents the clan charged with great fury on the front of the enemy while john macgregor with a strong party made an unexpected attack on the flank a great part of the colquhouns force consisted in cavalry which could not act in the boggy ground they were said to have disputed the field manfully but were at length completely routed and a merciless slaughter was exercised on the fugitives of whom betwixt two and three hundred fell on the field and in the pursuit if the macgregors lost as is averred only two men slain in the action they had slight provocation for an indiscriminate massacre it is said that their fury extended itself to a party of students for clerical orders who had imprudently come to see the battle some doubt is thrown on this fact from the indictment against the chief of the clan gregor being silent on the subject as is the historian johnston and a professor ross who wrote an account of the battle twentynine years after it was fought it is however constantly averred by the tradition of the country and a stone where the deed was done is called leckamhinisteir the minister or clerks flagstone the macgregors by a tradition which is now found to be inaccurate impute this cruel action to the ferocity of a single man of their tribe renowned for size and strength called dugald ciar mhor or the great mousecoloured man he was macgregors fosterbrother and the chief committed the youths to his charge with directions to keep them safely till the affray was over whether fearful of their escape or incensed by some sarcasms which they threw on his tribe or whether out of mere thirst of blood this savage while the other macgregors were engaged in the pursuit poniarded his helpless and defenceless prisoners when the chieftain on his return demanded where the youths were the ciar pronounced kiar mhor drew out his bloody dirk saying in gaelic ask that and god save me the latter words allude to the exclamation which his victims used when he was murdering them it would seem therefore that this horrible part of the story is founded on fact though the number of the youths so slain is probably exaggerated in the lowland accounts the common people say that the blood of the ciar mhors victims can never be washed off the stone when macgregor learnt their fate he expressed the utmost horror at the deed and upbraided his fosterbrother with having done that which would occasion the destruction of him and his clan this supposed homicide was the ancestor of rob roy and the tribe from which he was descended he lies buried at the church of fortingal where his sepulchre covered with a large stone is still shown and where his great strength and courage are the theme of many traditions note a the grey stone of macgregor note b dugald ciar mhor macgregors brother was one of the very few of the tribe who was slain he was buried near the field of battle and the place is marked by a rude stone called the grey stone of macgregor sir humphrey colquhoun being well mounted escaped for the time to the castle of banochar or benechra it proved no sure defence however for he was shortly after murdered in a vault of the castle the family annals say by the macgregors though other accounts charge the deed upon the macfarlanes this battle of glenfruin and the severity which the victors exercised in the pursuit was reported to king james vi in a manner the most unfavourable to the clan gregor whose general character being that of lawless though brave men could not much avail them in such a case that james might fully understand the extent of the slaughter the widows of the slain to the number of eleven score in deep mourning riding upon white palfreys and each bearing her husbands bloody shirt on a spear appeared at stirling in presence of a monarch peculiarly accessible to such sights of fear and sorrow to demand vengeance for the death of their husbands upon those by whom they had been made desolate the remedy resorted to was at least as severe as the cruelties which it was designed to punish by an act of the privy council dated d april the name of macgregor was expressly abolished and those who had hitherto borne it were commanded to change it for other surnames the pain of death being denounced against those who should call themselves gregor or macgregor the names of their fathers under the same penalty all who had been at the conflict of glenfruin or accessory to other marauding parties charged in the act were prohibited from carrying weapons except a pointless knife to eat their victuals by a subsequent act of council th june death was denounced against any persons of the tribe formerly called macgregor who should presume to assemble in greater numbers than four again by an act of parliament chap these laws were continued and extended to the rising generation in respect that great numbers of the children of those against whom the acts of privy council had been directed were stated to be then approaching to maturity who if permitted to resume the name of their parents would render the clan as strong as it was before the execution of those severe acts was chiefly intrusted in the west to the earl of argyle and the powerful clan of campbell and to the earl of athole and his followers in the more eastern highlands of perthshire the macgregors failed not to resist with the most determined courage and many a valley in the west and north highlands retains memory of the severe conflicts in which the proscribed clan sometimes obtained transient advantages and always sold their lives dearly at length the pride of allaster macgregor the chief of the clan was so much lowered by the sufferings of his people that he resolved to surrender himself to the earl of argyle with his principal followers on condition that they should be sent out of scotland if the unfortunate chiefs own account be true he had more reasons than one for expecting some favour from the earl who had in secret advised and encouraged him to many of the desperate actions for which he was now called to so severe a reckoning but argyle as old birrell expresses himself kept a highlandmans promise with them fulfilling it to the ear and breaking it to the sense macgregor was sent under a strong guard to the frontier of england and being thus in the literal sense sent out of scotland argyle was judged to have kept faith with him though the same party which took him there brought him back to edinburgh in custody macgregor of glenstrae was tried before the court of justiciary th january and found guilty he appears to have been instantly conveyed from the bar to the gallows for birrell of the same date reports that he was hanged at the cross and for distinction sake was suspended higher by his own height than two of his kindred and friends on the th of february following more men of the macgregors were executed after a long imprisonment and several others in the beginning of march the earl of argyles service in conducting to the surrender of the insolent and wicked race and name of macgregor notorious common malefactors and in the inbringing of macgregor with a great many of the leading men of the clan worthily executed to death for their offences is thankfully acknowledged by an act of parliament chap and rewarded with a grant of twenty chalders of victual out of the lands of kintire the macgregors notwithstanding the letters of fire and sword and orders for military execution repeatedly directed against them by the scottish legislature who apparently lost all the calmness of conscious dignity and security and could not even name the outlawed clan without vituperation showed no inclination to be blotted out of the roll of clanship they submitted to the law indeed so far as to take the names of the neighbouring families amongst whom they happened to live nominally becoming as the case might render it most convenient drummonds campbells grahams buchanans stewarts and the like but to all intents and purposes of combination and mutual attachment they remained the clan gregor united together for right or wrong and menacing with the general vengeance of their race all who committed aggressions against any individual of their number they continued to take and give offence with as little hesitation as before the legislative dispersion which had been attempted as appears from the preamble to statute chapter setting forth that the clan gregor which had been suppressed and reduced to quietness by the great care of the late king james of eternal memory had nevertheless broken out again in the counties of perth stirling clackmannan monteith lennox angus and mearns for which reason the statute reestablishes the disabilities attached to the clan and grants a new commission for enforcing the laws against that wicked and rebellious race notwithstanding the extreme severities of king james i and charles i against this unfortunate people who were rendered furious by proscription and then punished for yielding to the passions which had been wilfully irritated the macgregors to a man attached themselves during the civil war to the cause of the latter monarch their bards have ascribed this to the native respect of the macgregors for the crown of scotland which their ancestors once wore and have appealed to their armorial bearings which display a pinetree crossed saltire wise with a naked sword the point of which supports a royal crown but without denying that such motives may have had their weight we are disposed to think that a war which opened the low country to the raids of the clan gregor would have more charms for them than any inducement to espouse the cause of the covenanters which would have brought them into contact with highlanders as fierce as themselves and having as little to lose patrick macgregor their leader was the son of a distinguished chief named duncan abbarach to whom montrose wrote letters as to his trusty and special friend expressing his reliance on his devoted loyalty with an assurance that when once his majestys affairs were placed upon a permanent footing the grievances of the clan macgregor should be redressed at a subsequent period of these melancholy times we find the clan gregor claiming the immunities of other tribes when summoned by the scottish parliament to resist the invasion of the commonwealths army in on the last day of march in that year a supplication to the king and parliament from calum maccondachie vich euen and euen maccondachie euen in their own name and that of the whole name of macgregor set forth that while in obedience to the orders of parliament enjoining all clans to come out in the present service under their chieftains for the defence of religion king and kingdoms the petitioners were drawing their men to guard the passes at the head of the river forth they were interfered with by the earl of athole and the laird of buchanan who had required the attendance of many of the clan gregor upon their arrays this interference was doubtless owing to the change of name which seems to have given rise to the claim of the earl of athole and the laird of buchanan to muster the macgregors under their banners as murrays or buchanans it does not appear that the petition of the macgregors to be permitted to come out in a body as other clans received any answer but upon the restoration king charles in the first scottish parliament of his reign statute chap annulled the various acts against the clan gregor and restored them to the full use of their family name and the other privileges of liege subjects setting forth as a reason for this lenity that those who were formerly designed macgregors had during the late troubles conducted themselves with such loyalty and affection to his majesty as might justly wipe off all memory of former miscarriages and take away all marks of reproach for the same it is singular enough that it seems to have aggravated the feelings of the nonconforming presbyterians when the penalties which were most unjustly imposed upon themselves were relaxed towards the poor macgregors so little are the best men any more than the worst able to judge with impartiality of the same measures as applied to themselves or to others upon the restoration an influence inimical to this unfortunate clan said to be the same with that which afterwards dictated the massacre of glencoe occasioned the reenaction of the penal statutes against the macgregors there are no reasons given why these highly penal acts should have been renewed nor is it alleged that the clan had been guilty of late irregularities indeed there is some reason to think that the clause was formed of set purpose in a shape which should elude observation for though containing conclusions fatal to the rights of so many scottish subjects it is neither mentioned in the title nor the rubric of the act of parliament in which it occurs and is thrown briefly in at the close of the statute chap entitled an act for the justiciary in the highlands it does not however appear that after the revolution the acts against the clan were severely enforced and in the latter half of the eighteenth century they were not enforced at all commissioners of supply were named in parliament by the proscribed title of macgregor and decrees of courts of justice were pronounced and legal deeds entered into under the same appellative the macgregors however while the laws continued in the statutebook still suffered under the deprivation of the name which was their birthright and some attempts were made for the purpose of adopting another macalpine or grant being proposed as the title of the whole clan in future no agreement however could be entered into and the evil was submitted to as a matter of necessity until full redress was obtained from the british parliament by an act abolishing for ever the penal statutes which had been so long imposed upon this ancient race this statute well merited by the services of many a gentleman of the clan in behalf of their king and country was passed and the clan proceeded to act upon it with the same spirit of ancient times which had made them suffer severely under a deprivation that would have been deemed of little consequence by a great part of their fellowsubjects they entered into a deed recognising john murray of lanrick esq afterwards sir john macgregor baronet representative of the family of glencarnock as lawfully descended from the ancient stock and blood of the lairds and lords of macgregor and therefore acknowledged him as their chief on all lawful occasions and causes whatsoever the deed was subscribed by eight hundred and twentysix persons of the name of macgregor capable of bearing arms a great many of the clan during the last war formed themselves into what was called the clan alpine regiment raised in under the command of their chief and his brother colonel macgregor having briefly noticed the history of this clan which presents a rare and interesting example of the indelible character of the patriarchal system the author must now offer some notices of the individual who gives name to these volumes in giving an account of a highlander his pedigree is first to be considered that of rob roy was deduced from ciar mhor the great mousecoloured man who is accused by tradition of having slain the young students at the battle of glenfruin without puzzling ourselves and our readers with the intricacies of highland genealogy it is enough to say that after the death of allaster macgregor of glenstrae the clan discouraged by the unremitting persecution of their enemies seem not to have had the means of placing themselves under the command of a single chief according to their places of residence and immediate descent the several families were led and directed by chieftains which in the highland acceptation signifies the head of a particular branch of a tribe in opposition to chief who is the leader and commander of the whole name the family and descendants of dugald ciar mhor lived chiefly in the mountains between loch lomond and loch katrine and occupied a good deal of property there whether by sufferance by the right of the sword which it was never safe to dispute with them or by legal titles of various kinds it would be useless to inquire and unnecessary to detail enough there they certainly were a people whom their most powerful neighbours were desirous to conciliate their friendship in peace being very necessary to the quiet of the vicinage and their assistance in war equally prompt and effectual rob roy macgregor campbell which last name he bore in consequence of the acts of parliament abolishing his own was the younger son of donald macgregor of glengyle said to have been a lieutenantcolonel probably in the service of james ii by his wife a daughter of campbell of glenfalloch robs own designation was of inversnaid but he appears to have acquired a right of some kind or other to the property or possession of craig royston a domain of rock and forest lying on the east side of loch lomond where that beautiful lake stretches into the dusky mountains of glenfalloch the time of his birth is uncertain but he is said to have been active in the scenes of war and plunder which succeeded the revolution and tradition affirms him to have been the leader in a predatory incursion into the parish of kippen in the lennox which took place in the year it was of almost a bloodless character only one person losing his life but from the extent of the depredation it was long distinguished by the name of the hership or devastation of kippen the time of his death is also uncertain but as he is said to have survived the year and died an aged man it is probable he may have been twentyfive about the time of the hership of kippen which would assign his birth to the middle of the th century see statistcal account of scotland st edition vol xviii p parish of kippen in the more quiet times which succeeded the revolution rob roy or red robert seems to have exerted his active talents which were of no mean order as a drover or trader in cattle to a great extent it may well be supposed that in those days no lowland much less english drovers ventured to enter the highlands the cattle which were the staple commodity of the mountains were escorted down to fairs on the borders of the lowlands by a party of highlanders with their arms rattling around them and who dealt however in all honour and good faith with their southern customers a fray indeed would sometimes arise when the lowlandmen chiefly borderers who had to supply the english market used to dip their bonnets in the next brook and wrapping them round their hands oppose their cudgels to the naked broadswords which had not always the superiority i have heard from aged persons who had been engaged in such affrays that the highlanders used remarkably fair play never using the point of the sword far less their pistols or daggers so that with many a stiff thwack and many a bang hard crabtree and cold iron rang a slash or two or a broken head was easily accommodated and as the trade was of benefit to both parties trifling skirmishes were not allowed to interrupt its harmony indeed it was of vital interest to the highlanders whose income so far as derived from their estates depended entirely on the sale of black cattle and a sagacious and experienced dealer benefited not only himself but his friends and neighbours by his speculations those of rob roy were for several years so successful as to inspire general confidence and raise him in the estimation of the country in which he resided his importance was increased by the death of his father in consequence of which he succeeded to the management of his nephew gregor macgregor of glengyles property and as his tutor to such influence with the clan and following as was due to the representative of dugald ciar such influence was the more uncontrolled that this family of the macgregors seemed to have refused adherence to macgregor of glencarnock the ancestor of the present sir ewan macgregor and asserted a kind of independence it was at this time that rob roy acquired an interest by purchase wadset or otherwise to the property of craig royston already mentioned he was in particular favour during this prosperous period of his life with his nearest and most powerful neighbour james first duke of montrose from whom he received many marks of regard his grace consented to give his nephew and himself a right of property on the estates of glengyle and inversnaid which they had till then only held as kindly tenants the duke also with a view to the interest of the country and his own estate supported our adventurer by loans of money to a considerable amount to enable him to carry on his speculations in the cattle trade unfortunately that species of commerce was and is liable to sudden fluctuations and rob roy was by a sudden depression of markets and as a friendly tradition adds by the bad faith of a partner named macdonald whom he had imprudently received into his confidence and intrusted with a considerable sum of money rendered totally insolvent he absconded of course not emptyhanded if it be true as stated in an advertisement for his apprehension that he had in his possession sums to the amount of l sterling obtained from several noblemen and gentlemen under pretence of purchasing cows for them in the highlands this advertisement appeared in june and was several times repeated it fixes the period when rob roy exchanged his commercial adventures for speculations of a very different complexion see appendix no i he appears at this period first to have removed from his ordinary dwelling at inversnaid ten or twelve scots miles which is double the number of english farther into the highlands and commenced the lawless sort of life which he afterwards followed the duke of montrose who conceived himself deceived and cheated by macgregors conduct employed legal means to recover the money lent to him rob roys landed property was attached by the regular form of legal procedure and his stock and furniture made the subject of arrest and sale it is said that this diligence of the law as it is called in scotland which the english more bluntly term distress was used in this case with uncommon severity and that the legal satellites not usually the gentlest persons in the world had insulted macgregors wife in a manner which would have aroused a milder man than he to thoughts of unbounded vengeance she was a woman of fierce and haughty temper and is not unlikely to have disturbed the officers in the execution of their duty and thus to have incurred ill treatment though for the sake of humanity it is to be hoped that the story sometimes told is a popular exaggeration it is certain that she felt extreme anguish at being expelled from the banks of loch lomond and gave vent to her feelings in a fine piece of pipemusic still well known to amateurs by the name of rob roys lament the fugitive is thought to have found his first place of refuge in glen dochart under the earl of breadalbanes protection for though that family had been active agents in the destruction of the macgregors in former times they had of late years sheltered a great many of the name in their old possessions the duke of argyle was also one of rob roys protectors so far as to afford him according to the highland phrase wood and water the shelter namely that is afforded by the forests and lakes of an inaccessible country the great men of the highlands in that time besides being anxiously ambitious to keep up what was called their following or military retainers were also desirous to have at their disposal men of resolute character to whom the world and the worlds law were no friends and who might at times ravage the lands or destroy the tenants of a feudal enemy without bringing responsibility on their patrons the strife between the names of campbell and graham during the civil wars of the seventeenth century had been stamped with mutual loss and inveterate enmity the death of the great marquis of montrose on the one side the defeat at inverlochy and cruel plundering of lorn on the other were reciprocal injuries not likely to be forgotten rob roy was therefore sure of refuge in the country of the campbells both as having assumed their name as connected by his mother with the family of glenfalloch and as an enemy to the rival house of montrose the extent of argyles possessions and the power of retreating thither in any emergency gave great encouragement to the bold schemes of revenge which he had adopted this was nothing short of the maintenance of a predatory war against the duke of montrose whom he considered as the author of his exclusion from civil society and of the outlawry to which he had been sentenced by letters of horning and caption legal writs so called as well as the seizure of his goods and adjudication of his landed property against his grace therefore his tenants friends allies and relatives he disposed himself to employ every means of annoyance in his power and though this was a circle sufficiently extensive for active depredation rob who professed himself a jacobite took the liberty of extending his sphere of operations against all whom he chose to consider as friendly to the revolutionary government or to that most obnoxious of measures the union of the kingdoms under one or other of these pretexts all his neighbours of the lowlands who had anything to lose or were unwilling to compound for security by paying him an annual sum for protection or forbearance were exposed to his ravages the country in which this private warfare or system of depredation was to be carried on was until opened up by roads in the highest degree favourable for his purpose it was broken up into narrow valleys the habitable part of which bore no proportion to the huge wildernesses of forest rocks and precipices by which they were encircled and which was moreover full of inextricable passes morasses and natural strengths unknown to any but the inhabitants themselves where a few men acquainted with the ground were capable with ordinary address of baffling the pursuit of numbers the opinions and habits of the nearest neighbours to the highland line were also highly favourable to rob roys purpose a large proportion of them were of his own clan of macgregor who claimed the property of balquhidder and other highland districts as having been part of the ancient possessions of their tribe though the harsh laws under the severity of which they had suffered so deeply had assigned the ownership to other families the civil wars of the seventeenth century had accustomed these men to the use of arms and they were peculiarly brave and fierce from remembrance of their sufferings the vicinity of a comparatively rich lowland district gave also great temptations to incursion many belonging to other clans habituated to contempt of industry and to the use of arms drew towards an unprotected frontier which promised facility of plunder and the state of the country now so peaceable and quiet verified at that time the opinion which dr johnson heard with doubt and suspicion that the most disorderly and lawless districts of the highlands were those which lay nearest to the lowland line there was therefore no difficulty in rob roy descended of a tribe which was widely dispersed in the country we have described collecting any number of followers whom he might be able to keep in action and to maintain by his proposed operations he himself appears to have been singularly adapted for the profession which he proposed to exercise his stature was not of the tallest but his person was uncommonly strong and compact the greatest peculiarities of his frame were the breadth of his shoulders and the great and almost disproportionate length of his arms so remarkable indeed that it was said he could without stooping tie the garters of his highland hose which are placed two inches below the knee his countenance was open manly stern at periods of danger but frank and cheerful in his hours of festivity his hair was dark red thick and frizzled and curled short around the face his fashion of dress showed of course the knees and upper part of the leg which was described to me as resembling that of a highland bull hirsute with red hair and evincing muscular strength similar to that animal to these personal qualifications must be added a masterly use of the highland sword in which his length of arm gave him great advantage and a perfect and intimate knowledge of all the recesses of the wild country in which he harboured and the character of the various individuals whether friendly or hostile with whom he might come in contact his mental qualities seem to have been no less adapted to the circumstances in which he was placed though the descendant of the bloodthirsty ciar mhor he inherited none of his ancestors ferocity on the contrary rob roy avoided every appearance of cruelty and it is not averred that he was ever the means of unnecessary bloodshed or the actor in any deed which could lead the way to it his schemes of plunder were contrived and executed with equal boldness and sagacity and were almost universally successful from the skill with which they were laid and the secrecy and rapidity with which they were executed like robin hood of england he was a kind and gentle robber and while he took from the rich was liberal in relieving the poor this might in part be policy but the universal tradition of the country speaks it to have arisen from a better motive all whom i have conversed with and i have in my youth seen some who knew rob roy personally give him the character of a benevolent and humane man in his way his ideas of morality were those of an arab chief being such as naturally arose out of his wild education supposing rob roy to have argued on the tendency of the life which he pursued whether from choice or from necessity he would doubtless have assumed to himself the character of a brave man who deprived of his natural rights by the partiality of laws endeavoured to assert them by the strong hand of natural power and he is most felicitously described as reasoning thus in the hightoned poetry of my gifted friend wordsworth say then that he was wise as brave as wise in thought as bold in deed for in the principles of things he sought his moral creed said generous rob what need of books burn all the statutes and their shelves they stir us up against our kind and worse against ourselves we have a passion make a law too false to guide us or control and for the law itself we fight in bitterness of soul and puzzled blinded then we lose distinctions that are plain and few these find i graven on my heart that tells me what to do the creatures see of flood and field and those that travel on the wind with them no strife can last they live in peace and peace of mind for why because the good old rule sufficeth them the simple plan that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can a lesson which is quickly learnd a signal through which all can see thus nothing here provokes the strong to wanton cruelty and freakishness of mind is checkd he tamed who foolishly aspires while to the measure of his might each fashions his desires all kinds and creatures stand and fall by strength of prowess or of wit tis gods appointment who must sway and who is to submit since then said robin right is plain and longest life is but a day to have my ends maintain my rights ill take the shortest way and thus among these rocks he lived through summers heat and winters snow the eagle he was lord above and rob was lord below we are not however to suppose the character of this distinguished outlaw to be that of an actual hero acting uniformly and consistently on such moral principles as the illustrious bard who standing by his grave has vindicated his fame on the contrary as is common with barbarous chiefs rob roy appears to have mixed his professions of principle with a large alloy of craft and dissimulation of which his conduct during the civil war is sufficient proof it is also said and truly that although his courtesy was one of his strongest characteristics yet sometimes he assumed an arrogance of manner which was not easily endured by the highspirited men to whom it was addressed and drew the daring outlaw into frequent disputes from which he did not always come off with credit from this it has been inferred that rob roy w as more of a bully than a hero or at least that he had according to the common phrase his fighting days some aged men who knew him well have described him also as better at a taichtulzie or scuffle within doors than in mortal combat the tenor of his life may be quoted to repel this charge while at the same time it must be allowed that the situation in which he was placed rendered him prudently averse to maintaining quarrels where nothing was to be had save blows and where success would have raised up against him new and powerful enemies in a country where revenge was still considered as a duty rather than a crime the power of commanding his passions on such occasions far from being inconsistent with the part which macgregor had to perform was essentially necessary at the period when he lived to prevent his career from being cut short i may here mention one or two occasions on which rob roy appears to have given way in the manner alluded to my late venerable friend john ramsay of ochtertyre alike eminent as a classical scholar and as an authentic register of the ancient history and manners of scotland informed me that on occasion of a public meeting at a bonfire in the town of doune rob roy gave some offence to james edmondstone of newton the same gentleman who was unfortunately concerned in the slaughter of lord rollo see maclaurins criminal trials no ix when edmondstone compelled macgregor to quit the town on pain of being thrown by him into the bonfire i broke one off your ribs on a former occasion said he and now rob if you provoke me farther i will break your neck but it must be remembered that edmondstone was a man of consequence in the jacobite party as he carried the royal standard of james vii at the battle of sheriffmuir and also that he was near the door of his own mansionhouse and probably surrounded by his friends and adherents rob roy however suffered in reputation for retiring under such a threat another wellvouched case is that of cunningham of boquhan henry cunningham esq of boquhan was a gentleman of stirlingshire who like many exquisites of our own time united a natural high spirit and daring character with an affectation of delicacy of address and manners amounting to foppery his courage and affectation of foppery were united which is less frequently the case with a spirit of innate modesty he is thus described in lord binnings satirical verses entitled argyles levee six times had harry bowed unseen before he dared advance the duke then turning round well pleased said sure youve been in france a more polite and jaunty man i never saw before then harry bowed and blushed and bowed and strutted to the door see a collection of original poems by scotch gentlemen vol ii p he chanced to be in company with rob roy who either in contempt of boquhans supposed effeminacy or because he thought him a safe person to fix a quarrel on a point which robs enemies alleged he was wont to consider insulted him so grossly that a challenge passed between them the goodwife of the clachan had hidden cunninghams sword and while he rummaged the house in quest of his own or some other rob roy went to the shieling hill the appointed place of combat and paraded there with great majesty waiting for his antagonist in the meantime cunningham had rummaged out an old sword and entering the ground of contest in all haste rushed on the outlaw with such unexpected fury that he fairly drove him off the field nor did he show himself in the village again for some time mr macgregor stirling has a softened account of this anecdote in his new edition of nimmos stirlingshire still he records rob roys discomfiture occasionally rob roy suffered disasters and incurred great personal danger on one remarkable occasion he was saved by the coolness of his lieutenant macanaleister or fletcher the little john of his band a fine active fellow of course and celebrated as a marksman it happened that macgregor and his party had been surprised and dispersed by a superior force of horse and foot and the word was given to split and squander each shifted for himself but a bold dragoon attached himself to pursuit of rob and overtaking him struck at him with his broadsword a plate of iron in his bonnet saved the macgregor from being cut down to the teeth but the blow was heavy enough to bear him to the ground crying as he fell oh macanaleister is there naething in her ie in the gun the trooper at the same time exclaiming d n ye your mother never wrought your nightcap had his arm raised for a second blow when macanaleister fired and the ball pierced the dragoons heart such as he was rob roys progress in his occupation is thus described by a gentleman of sense and talent who resided within the circle of his predatory wars had probably felt their effects and speaks of them as might be expected with little of the forbearance with which from their peculiar and romantic character they are now regarded this man rob roy macgregor was a person of sagacity and neither wanted stratagem nor address and having abandoned himself to all licentiousness set himself at the head of all the loose vagrant and desperate people of that clan in the west end of perth and stirling shires and infested those whole countries with thefts robberies and depredations very few who lived within his reach that is within the distance of a nocturnal expedition could promise to themselves security either for their persons or effects without subjecting themselves to pay him a heavy and shameful tax of blackmail he at last proceeded to such a degree of audaciousness that he committed robberies raised contributions and resented quarrels at the head of a very considerable body of armed men in open day and in the face of the government mr grahame of gartmores causes of the disturbances in the highlands see jamiesons edition of burts letters from the north of scotland appendix vol ii p the extent and success of these depredations cannot be surprising when we consider that the scene of them was laid in a country where the general law was neither enforced nor respected having recorded that the general habit of cattlestealing had blinded even those of the better classes to the infamy of the practice and that as mens property consisted entirely in herds it was rendered in the highest degree precarious mr grahame adds on these accounts there is no culture of ground no improvement of pastures and from the same reasons no manufactures no trade in short no industry the people are extremely prolific and therefore so numerous that there is not business in that country according to its present order and economy for the onehalf of them every place is full of idle people accustomed to arms and lazy in everything but rapines and depredations as buddel or aquavitae houses are to be found everywhere through the country so in these they saunter away their time and frequently consume there the returns of their illegal purchases here the laws have never been executed nor the authority of the magistrate ever established here the officer of the law neither dare nor can execute his duty and several places are about thirty miles from lawful persons in short here is no order no authority no government the period of the rebellion approached soon after rob roy had attained celebrity his jacobite partialities were now placed in opposition to his sense of the obligations which he owed to the indirect protection of the duke of argyle but the desire of drowning his sounding steps amid the din of general war induced him to join the forces of the earl of mar although his patron the duke of argyle was at the head of the army opposed to the highland insurgents the macgregors a large sept of them at least that of ciar mhor on this occasion were not commanded by rob roy but by his nephew already mentioned gregor macgregor otherwise called james grahame of glengyle and still better remembered by the gaelic epithet of ghlune dhu ie black knee from a black spot on one of his knees which his highland garb rendered visible there can be no question however that being then very young glengyle must have acted on most occasions by the advice and direction of so experienced a leader as his uncle the macgregors assembled in numbers at that period and began even to threaten the lowlands towards the lower extremity of loch lomond they suddenly seized all the boats which were upon the lake and probably with a view to some enterprise of their own drew them overland to inversnaid in order to intercept the progress of a large body of westcountry whigs who were in arms for the government and moving in that direction the whigs made an excursion for the recovery of the boats their forces consisted of volunteers from paisley kilpatrick and elsewhere who with the assistance of a body of seamen were towed up the river leven in longboats belonging to the ships of war then lying in the clyde at luss they were joined by the forces of sir humphrey colquhoun and james grant his soninlaw with their followers attired in the highland dress of the period which is picturesquely described the whole party crossed to craigroyston but the macgregors did not offer combat at night they arrived at luss where they were joined by sir humphrey colquhoun of luss and james grant of plascander his soninlaw followed by forty or fifty stately fellows in their short hose and belted plaids armed each of them with a wellfixed gun on his shoulder a strong handsome target with a sharppointed steel of above half an ell in length screwed into the navel of it on his left arm a sturdy claymore by his side and a pistol or two with a dirk and knife in his belt raes history of the rebellion to p if we are to believe the account of the expedition given by the historian rae they leapt on shore at craigroyston with the utmost intrepidity no enemy appearing to oppose them and by the noise of their drums which they beat incessantly and the discharge of their artillery and small arms terrified the macgregors whom they appear never to have seen out of their fastnesses and caused them to fly in a panic to the general camp of the highlanders at strathfillan the lowcountry men succeeded in getting possession of the boats at a great expenditure of noise and courage and little risk of danger note c the loch lomond expedition after this temporary removal from his old haunts rob roy was sent by the earl of mar to aberdeen to raise it is believed a part of the clan gregor which is settled in that country these men were of his own family the race of the ciar mhor they were the descendants of about three hundred macgregors whom the earl of murray about the year transported from his estates in menteith to oppose against his enemies the macintoshes a race as hardy and restless as they were themselves but while in the city of aberdeen rob roy met a relation of a very different class and character from those whom he was sent to summon to arms this was dr james gregory by descent a macgregor the patriarch of a dynasty of professors distinguished for literary and scientific talent and the grandfather of the late eminent physician and accomplished scholar professor gregory of edinburgh this gentleman was at the time professor of medicine in kings college aberdeen and son of dr james gregory distinguished in science as the inventor of the reflecting telescope with such a family it may seem our friend rob could have had little communion but civil war is a species of misery which introduces men to strange bedfellows dr gregory thought it a point of prudence to claim kindred at so critical a period with a man so formidable and influential he invited rob roy to his house and treated him with so much kindness that he produced in his generous bosom a degree of gratitude which seemed likely to occasion very inconvenient effects the professor had a son about eight or nine years old a lively stout boy of his age with whose appearance our highland robin hood was much taken on the day before his departure from the house of his learned relative rob roy who had pondered deeply how he might requite his cousins kindness took dr gregory aside and addressed him to this purport my dear kinsman i have been thinking what i could do to show my sense of your hospitality now here you have a fine spirited boy of a son whom you are ruining by cramming him with your useless booklearning and i am determined by way of manifesting my great goodwill to you and yours to take him with me and make a man of him the learned professor was utterly overwhelmed when his warlike kinsman announced his kind purpose in language which implied no doubt of its being a proposal which would be and ought to be accepted with the utmost gratitude the task of apology or explanation was of a most delicate description and there might have been considerable danger in suffering rob roy to perceive that the promotion with which he threatened the son was in the fathers eyes the ready road to the gallows indeed every excuse which he could at first think of such as regret for putting his friend to trouble with a youth who had been educated in the lowlands and so on only strengthened the chieftains inclination to patronise his young kinsman as he supposed they arose entirely from the modesty of the father he would for a long time take no apology and even spoke of carrying off the youth by a certain degree of kindly violence whether his father consented or not at length the perplexed professor pleaded that his son was very young and in an infirm state of health and not yet able to endure the hardships of a mountain life but that in another year or two he hoped his health would be firmly established and he would be in a fitting condition to attend on his brave kinsman and follow out the splendid destinies to which he opened the way this agreement being made the cousins parted rob roy pledging his honour to carry his young relation to the hills with him on his next return to aberdeenshire and dr gregory doubtless praying in his secret soul that he might never see robs highland face again james gregory who thus escaped being his kinsmans recruit and in all probability his henchman was afterwards professor of medicine in the college and like most of his family distinguished by his scientific acquirements he was rather of an irritable and pertinacious disposition and his friends were wont to remark when he showed any symptom of these foibles ah this comes of not having been educated by rob roy the connection between rob roy and his classical kinsman did not end with the period of robs transient power at a period considerably subsequent to the year he was walking in the castle street of aberdeen arm in arm with his host dr james gregory when the drums in the barracks suddenly beat to arms and soldiers were seen issuing from the barracks if these lads are turning out said rob taking leave of his cousin with great composure it is time for me to look after my safety so saying he dived down a close and as john bunyan says went upon his way and was seen no more the first of these anecdotes which brings the highest pitch of civilisation so closely in contact with the halfsavage state of society i have heard told by the late distinguished dr gregory and the members of his family have had the kindness to collate the story with their recollections and family documents and furnish the authentic particulars the second rests on the recollection of an old man who was present when rob took french leave of his literary cousin on hearing the drums beat and communicated the circumstance to mr alexander forbes a connection of dr gregory by marriage who is still alive we have already stated that rob roys conduct during the insurrection of was very equivocal his person and followers were in the highland army but his heart seems to have been with the duke of argyles yet the insurgents were constrained to trust to him as their only guide when they marched from perth towards dunblane with the view of crossing the forth at what are called the fords of frew and when they themselves said he could not be relied upon this movement to the westward on the part of the insurgents brought on the battle of sheriffmuir indecisive indeed in its immediate results but of which the duke of argyle reaped the whole advantage in this action it will be recollected that the right wing of the highlanders broke and cut to pieces argyles left wing while the clans on the left of mars army though consisting of stewarts mackenzies and camerons were completely routed during this medley of flight and pursuit rob roy retained his station on a hill in the centre of the highland position and though it is said his attack might have decided the day he could not be prevailed upon to charge this was the more unfortunate for the insurgents as the leading of a party of the macphersons had been committed to macgregor this it is said was owing to the age and infirmity of the chief of that name who unable to lead his clan in person objected to his heirapparent macpherson of nord discharging his duty on that occasion so that the tribe or a part of them were brigaded with their allies the macgregors while the favourable moment for action was gliding away unemployed mars positive orders reached rob roy that he should presently attack to which he coolly replied no no if they cannot do it without me they cannot do it with me one of the macphersons named alexander one of robs original profession videlicet a drover but a man of great strength and spirit was so incensed at the inactivity of this temporary leader that he threw off his plaid drew his sword and called out to his clansmen let us endure this no longer if he will not lead you i will rob roy replied with great coolness were the question about driving highland stots or kyloes sandie i would yield to your superior skill but as it respects the leading of men i must be allowed to be the better judge did the matter respect driving gleneigas stots answered the macpherson the question with rob would not be which was to be last but which was to be foremost incensed at this sarcasm macgregor drew his sword and they would have fought upon the spot if their friends on both sides had not interfered but the moment of attack was completely lost rob did not however neglect his own private interest on the occasion in the confusion of an undecided field of battle he enriched his followers by plundering the baggage and the dead on both sides the fine old satirical ballad on the battle of sheriffmuir does not forget to stigmatise our heros conduct on this memorable occasion rob roy he stood watch on a hill for to catch the booty for aught that i saw man for he neer advanced from the place where he stanced till nae mair was to do there at a man notwithstanding the sort of neutrality which rob roy had continued to observe during the progress of the rebellion he did not escape some of its penalties he was included in the act of attainder and the house in breadalbane which was his place of retreat was burned by general lord cadogan when after the conclusion of the insurrection he marched through the highlands to disarm and punish the offending clans but upon going to inverary with about forty or fifty of his followers rob obtained favour by an apparent surrender of their arms to colonel patrick campbell of finnah who furnished them and their leader with protections under his hand being thus in a great measure secured from the resentment of government rob roy established his residence at craigroyston near loch lomond in the midst of his own kinsmen and lost no time in resuming his private quarrel with the duke of montrose for this purpose he soon got on foot as many men and well armed too as he had yet commanded he never stirred without a bodyguard of ten or twelve picked followers and without much effort could increase them to fifty or sixty the duke was not wanting in efforts to destroy this troublesome adversary his grace applied to general carpenter commanding the forces in scotland and by his orders three parties of soldiers were directed from the three different points of glasgow stirling and finlarig near killin mr graham of killearn the duke of montroses relation and factor sheriffdepute also of dumbartonshire accompanied the troops that they might act under the civil authority and have the assistance of a trusty guide well acquainted with the hills it was the object of these several columns to arrive about the same time in the neighbourhood of rob roys residence and surprise him and his followers but heavy rains the difficulties of the country and the good intelligence which the outlaw was always supplied with disappointed their wellconcerted combination the troops finding the birds were flown avenged themselves by destroying the nest they burned rob roys house though not with impunity for the macgregors concealed among the thickets and cliffs fired on them and killed a grenadier rob roy avenged himself for the loss which he sustained on this occasion by an act of singular audacity about the middle of november john graham of killearn already mentioned as factor of the montrose family went to a place called chapel errock where the tenants of the duke were summoned to appear with their termly rents they appeared accordingly and the factor had received ready money to the amount of about l when rob roy entered the room at the head of an armed party the steward endeavoured to protect the dukes property by throwing the books of accounts and money into a garret trusting they might escape notice but the experienced freebooter was not to be baffled where such a prize was at stake he recovered the books and cash placed himself calmly in the receipt of custom examined the accounts pocketed the money and gave receipts on the dukes part saying he would hold reckoning with the duke of montrose out of the damages which he had sustained by his graces means in which he included the losses he had suffered as well by the burning of his house by general cadogan as by the later expedition against craigroyston he then requested mr graham to attend him nor does it appear that he treated him with any personal violence or even rudeness although he informed him he regarded him as a hostage and menaced rough usage in case he should be pursued or in danger of being overtaken few more audacious feats have been performed after some rapid changes of place the fatigue attending which was the only annoyance that mr graham seems to have complained of he carried his prisoner to an island on loch katrine and caused him to write to the duke to state that his ransom was fixed at l merks being the balance which macgregor pretended remained due to him after deducting all that he owed to the duke of montrose however after detaining mr graham five or six days in custody on the island which is still called rob roys prison and could be no comfortable dwelling for november nights the outlaw seems to have despaired of attaining further advantage from his bold attempt and suffered his prisoner to depart uninjured with the accountbooks and bills granted by the tenants taking especial care to retain the cash the reader will find two original letters of the duke of montrose with that which mr graham of killearn despatched from his prisonhouse by the outlaws command in the appendix no ii about our chieftain had the dangerous adventure of falling into the hands of the duke of athole almost as much his enemy as the duke of montrose himself but his cunning and dexterity again freed him from certain death see a contemporary account of this curious affair in the appendix no v other pranks are told of rob which argue the same boldness and sagacity as the seizure of killearn the duke of montrose weary of his insolence procured a quantity of arms and distributed them among his tenantry in order that they might defend themselves against future violences but they fell into different hands from those they were intended for the macgregors made separate attacks on the houses of the tenants and disarmed them all one after another not as was supposed without the consent of many of the persons so disarmed as a great part of the dukes rents were payable in kind there were girnels granaries established for storing up the corn at moulin and elsewhere on the buchanan estate to these storehouses rob roy used to repair with a sufficient force and of course when he was least expected and insist upon the delivery of quantities of grain sometimes for his own use and sometimes for the assistance of the country people always giving regular receipts in his own name and pretending to reckon with the duke for what sums he received in the meanwhile a garrison was established by government the ruins of which may be still seen about halfway betwixt loch lomond and loch katrine upon rob roys original property of inversnaid even this military establishment could not bridle the restless macgregor he contrived to surprise the little fort disarm the soldiers and destroy the fortification it was afterwards reestablished and again taken by the macgregors under rob roys nephew ghlune dhu previous to the insurrection of finally the fort of inversnaid was a third time repaired after the extinction of civil discord and when we find the celebrated general wolfe commanding in it the imagination is strongly affected by the variety of time and events which the circumstance brings simultaneously to recollection it is now totally dismantled about when the author chanced to pass that way while on a tour through the highlands a garrison consisting of a single veteran was still maintained at inversnaid the venerable warder was reaping his barley croft in all peace and tranquillity and when we asked admittance to repose ourselves he told us we would find the key of the fort under the door it was not strictly speaking as a professed depredator that rob roy now conducted his operations but as a sort of contractor for the police in scottish phrase a lifter of blackmail the nature of this contract has been described in the novel of waverley and in the notes on that work mr grahame of gartmores description of the character may be here transcribed the confusion and disorders of the country were so great and the government go absolutely neglected it that the sober people were obliged to purchase some security to their effects by shameful and ignominious contracts of blackmail a person who had the greatest correspondence with the thieves was agreed with to preserve the lands contracted for from thefts for certain sums to be paid yearly upon this fund he employed one half of the thieves to recover stolen cattle and the other half of them to steal in order to make this agreement and blackmail contract necessary the estates of those gentlemen who refused to contract or give countenance to that pernicious practice are plundered by the thieving part of the watch in order to force them to purchase their protection their leader calls himself the captain of the watch and his banditti go by that name and as this gives them a kind of authority to traverse the country so it makes them capable of doing any mischief these corps through the highlands make altogether a very considerable body of men inured from their infancy to the greatest fatigues and very capable to act in a military way when occasion offers people who are ignorant and enthusiastic who are in absolute dependence upon their chief or landlord who are directed in their consciences by roman catholic priests or nonjuring clergymen and who are not masters of any property may easily be formed into any mould they fear no dangers as they have nothing to lose and so can with ease be induced to attempt anything nothing can make their condition worse confusions and troubles do commonly indulge them in such licentiousness that by these they better it letters from the north of scotland vol ii pp as the practice of contracting for blackmail was an obvious encouragement to rapine and a great obstacle to the course of justice it was by the statute chap declared a capital crime both on the part of him who levied and him who paid this sort of tax but the necessity of the case prevented the execution of this severe law i believe in any one instance and men went on submitting to a certain unlawful imposition rather than run the risk of utter ruin just as it is now found difficult or impossible to prevent those who have lost a very large sum of money by robbery from compounding with the felons for restoration of a part of their booty at what rate rob roy levied blackmail i never heard stated but there is a formal contract by which his nephew in agreed with various landholders of estates in the counties of perth stirling and dumbarton to recover cattle stolen from them or to pay the value within six months of the loss being intimated if such intimation were made to him with sufficient despatch in consideration of a payment of l on each l of valued rent which was not a very heavy insurance petty thefts were not included in the contract but the theft of one horse or one head of black cattle or of sheep exceeding the number of six fell under the agreement rob roys profits upon such contracts brought him in a considerable revenue in money or cattle of which he made a popular use for he was publicly liberal as well as privately beneficent the minister of the parish of balquhidder whose name was robertson was at one time threatening to pursue the parish for an augmentation of his stipend rob roy took an opportunity to assure him that he would do well to abstain from this new exaction a hint which the minister did not fail to understand but to make him some indemnification macgregor presented him every year with a cow and a fat sheep and no scruples as to the mode in which the donor came by them are said to have affected the reverend gentlemans conscience the following amount of the proceedings of rob roy on an application to him from one of his contractors had in it something very interesting to me as told by an old countryman in the lennox who was present on the expedition but as there is no point or marked incident in the story and as it must necessarily be without the halffrightened halfbewildered look with which the narrator accompanied his recollections it may possibly lose its effect when transferred to paper my informant stated himself to have been a lad of fifteen living with his father on the estate of a gentleman in the lennox whose name i have forgotten in the capacity of herd on a fine morning in the end of october the period when such calamities were almost always to be apprehended they found the highland thieves had been down upon them and swept away ten or twelve head of cattle rob roy was sent for and came with a party of seven or eight armed men he heard with great gravity all that could be told him of the circumstances of the creagh and expressed his confidence that the herdwiddiefows could not have carried their booty far and that he should be able to recover them mad herdsmen a name given to cattlestealers properly one who deserves to fill a widdie or halter he desired that two lowlanders should be sent on the party as it was not to be expected that any of his gentlemen would take the trouble of driving the cattle when he should recover possession of them my informant and his father were despatched on the expedition they had no good will to the journey nevertheless provided with a little food and with a dog to help them to manage the cattle they set off with macgregor they travelled a long days journey in the direction of the mountain benvoirlich and slept for the night in a ruinous hut or bothy the next morning they resumed their journey among the hills rob roy directing their course by signs and marks on the heath which my informant did not understand about noon rob commanded the armed party to halt and to lie couched in the heather where it was thickest do you and your son he said to the oldest lowlander go boldly over the hill you will see beneath you in a glen on the other side your masters cattle feeding it may be with others gather your own together taking care to disturb no one else and drive them to this place if any one speak to or threaten you tell them that i am here at the head of twenty men but what if they abuse us or kill us said the lowland peasant by no means delighted at finding the embassy imposed on him and his son if they do you any wrong said rob i will never forgive them as long as i live the lowlander was by no means content with this security but did not think it safe to dispute robs injunctions illustration cattle lifting he and his son climbed the hill therefore found a deep valley where there grazed as rob had predicted a large herd of cattle they cautiously selected those which their master had lost and took measures to drive them over the hill as soon as they began to remove them they were surprised by hearing cries and screams and looking around in fear and trembling they saw a woman seeming to have started out of the earth who flyted at them that is scolded them in gaelic when they contrived however in the best gaelic they could muster to deliver the message rob roy told them she became silent and disappeared without offering them any further annoyance the chief heard their story on their return and spoke with great complacency of the art which he possessed of putting such things to rights without any unpleasant bustle the party were now on their road home and the danger though not the fatigue of the expedition was at an end they drove on the cattle with little repose until it was nearly dark when rob proposed to halt for the night upon a wide moor across which a cold northeast wind with frost on its wing was whistling to the tune of the pipers of strathdearn the winds which sweep a wild glen in badenoch are so called the highlanders sheltered by their plaids lay down on the heath comfortably enough but the lowlanders had no protection whatever rob roy observing this directed one of his followers to afford the old man a portion of his plaid for the callant boy he may said the freebooter keep himself warm by walking about and watching the cattle my informant heard this sentence with no small distress and as the frost wind grew more and more cutting it seemed to freeze the very blood in his young veins he had been exposed to weather all his life he said but never could forget the cold of that night insomuch that in the bitterness of his heart he cursed the bright moon for giving no heat with so much light at length the sense of cold and weariness became so intolerable that he resolved to desert his watch to seek some repose and shelter with that purpose he couched himself down behind one of the most bulky of the highlanders who acted as lieutenant to the party not satisfied with having secured the shelter of the mans large person he coveted a share of his plaid and by imperceptible degrees drew a corner of it round him he was now comparatively in paradise and slept sound till daybreak when he awoke and was terribly afraid on observing that his nocturnal operations had altogether uncovered the dhuiniewassells neck and shoulders which lacking the plaid which should have protected them were covered with cranreuch ie hoar frost the lad rose in great dread of a beating at least when it should be found how luxuriously he had been accommodated at the expense of a principal person of the party good mr lieutenant however got up and shook himself rubbing off the hoar frost with his plaid and muttering something of a cauld neight they then drove on the cattle which were restored to their owner without farther adventure the above can hardly be termed a tale but yet it contains materials both for the poet and artist it was perhaps about the same time that by a rapid march into the balquhidder hills at the head of a body of his own tenantry the duke of montrose actually surprised rob roy and made him prisoner he was mounted behind one of the dukes followers named james stewart and made fast to him by a horsegirth the person who had him thus in charge was grandfather of the intelligent man of the same name now deceased who lately kept the inn in the vicinity of loch katrine and acted as a guide to visitors through that beautiful scenery from him i learned the story many years before he was either a publican or a guide except to moorfowl shooters it was evening to resume the story and the duke was pressing on to lodge his prisoner so long sought after in vain in some place of security when in crossing the teith or forth i forget which macgregor took an opportunity to conjure stewart by all the ties of old acquaintance and good neighbourhood to give him some chance of an escape from an assured doom stewart was moved with compassion perhaps with fear he slipt the girthbuckle and rob dropping down from behind the horses croupe dived swam and escaped pretty much as described in the novel when james stewart came on shore the duke hastily demanded where his prisoner was and as no distinct answer was returned instantly suspected stewarts connivance at the escape of the outlaw and drawing a steel pistol from his belt struck him down with a blow on the head from the effects of which his descendant said he never completely recovered in the success of his repeated escapes from the pursuit of his powerful enemy rob roy at length became wanton and facetious he wrote a mock challenge to the duke which he circulated among his friends to amuse them over a bottle the reader will find this document in the appendix it is written in a good hand and not particularly deficient in grammar or spelling appendix no iii our southern readers must be given to understand that it was a piece of humour a quiz in short on the part of the outlaw who was too sagacious to propose such a rencontre in reality this letter was written in the year in the following year rob roy composed another epistle very little to his own reputation as he therein confesses having played booty during the civil war of it is addressed to general wade at that time engaged in disarming the highland clans and making military roads through the country the letter is a singular composition it sets out the writers real and unfeigned desire to have offered his service to king george but for his liability to be thrown into jail for a civil debt at the instance of the duke of montrose being thus debarred from taking the right side he acknowledged he embraced the wrong one upon falstaffs principle that since the king wanted men and the rebels soldiers it were worse shame to be idle in such a stirring world than to embrace the worst side were it as black as rebellion could make it the impossibility of his being neutral in such a debate rob seems to lay down as an undeniable proposition at the same time while he acknowledges having been forced into an unnatural rebellion against king george he pleads that he not only avoided acting offensively against his majestys forces on all occasions but on the contrary sent to them what intelligence he could collect from time to time for the truth of which he refers to his grace the duke of argyle what influence this plea had on general wade we have no means of knowing rob roy appears to have continued to live very much as usual his fame in the meanwhile passed beyond the narrow limits of the country in which he resided a pretended history of him appeared in london during his lifetime under the title of the highland rogue it is a catchpenny publication bearing in front the effigy of a species of ogre with a beard of a foot in length and his actions are as much exaggerated as his personal appearance some few of the best known adventures of the hero are told though with little accuracy but the greater part of the pamphlet is entirely fictitious it is great pity so excellent a theme for a narrative of the kind had not fallen into the hands of de foe who was engaged at the time on subjects somewhat similar though inferior in dignity and interest as rob roy advanced in years he became more peaceable in his habits and his nephew ghlune dhu with most of his tribe renounced those peculiar quarrels with the duke of montrose by which his uncle had been distinguished the policy of that great family had latterly been rather to attach this wild tribe by kindness than to follow the mode of violence which had been hitherto ineffectually resorted to leases at a low rent were granted to many of the macgregors who had heretofore held possessions in the dukes highland property merely by occupancy and glengyle or blackknee who continued to act as collector of blackmail managed his police as a commander of the highland watch arrayed at the charge of government he is said to have strictly abstained from the open and lawless depredations which his kinsman had practised it was probably after this state of temporary quiet had been obtained that rob roy began to think of the concerns of his future state he had been bred and long professed himself a protestant but in his later years he embraced the roman catholic faith perhaps on mrs coles principle that it was a comfortable religion for one of his calling he is said to have alleged as the cause of his conversion a desire to gratify the noble family of perth who were then strict catholics having as he observed assumed the name of the duke of argyle his first protector he could pay no compliment worth the earl of perths acceptance save complying with his mode of religion rob did not pretend when pressed closely on the subject to justify all the tenets of catholicism and acknowledged that extreme unction always appeared to him a great waste of ulzie or oil such an admission is ascribed to the robber donald bean lean in waverley chap lxii in the last years of rob roys life his clan was involved in a dispute with one more powerful than themselves stewart of appin a chief of the tribe so named was proprietor of a hillfarm in the braes of balquhidder called invernenty the macgregors of rob roys tribe claimed a right to it by ancient occupancy and declared they would oppose to the uttermost the settlement of any person upon the farm not being of their own name the stewarts came down with two hundred men well armed to do themselves justice by main force the macgregors took the field but were unable to muster an equal strength rob roy fending himself the weaker party asked a parley in which he represented that both clans were friends to the king and that he was unwilling they should be weakened by mutual conflict and thus made a merit of surrendering to appin the disputed territory of invernenty appin accordingly settled as tenants there at an easy quitrent the maclarens a family dependent on the stewarts and from whose character for strength and bravery it was expected that they would make their right good if annoyed by the macgregors when all this had been amicably adjusted in presence of the two clans drawn up in arms near the kirk of balquhidder rob roy apparently fearing his tribe might be thought to have conceded too much upon the occasion stepped forward and said that where so many gallant men were met in arms it would be shameful to part without it trial of skill and therefore he took the freedom to invite any gentleman of the stewarts present to exchange a few blows with him for the honour of their respective clans the brotherinlaw of appin and second chieftain of the clan alaster stewart of invernahyle accepted the challenge and they encountered with broadsword and target before their respective kinsmen some accounts state that appin himself was rob roys antagonist on this occasion my recollection from the account of invernahyle himself was as stated in the text but the period when i received the information is now so distant that it is possible i may be mistaken invernahyle was rather of low stature but very well made athletic and an excellent swordsman the combat lasted till rob received a slight wound in the arm which was the usual termination of such a combat when fought for honour only and not with a mortal purpose rob roy dropped his point and congratulated his adversary on having been the first man who ever drew blood from him the victor generously acknowledged that without the advantage of youth and the agility accompanying it he probably could not have come off with advantage this was probably one of rob roys last exploits in arms the time of his death is not known with certainty but he is generally said to have survived and to have died an aged man when he found himself approaching his final change he expressed some contrition for particular parts of his life his wife laughed at these scruples of conscience and exhorted him to die like a man as he had lived in reply he rebuked her for her violent passions and the counsels she had given him you have put strife he said betwixt me and the best men of the country and now you would place enmity between me and my god there is a tradition no way inconsistent with the former if the character of rob roy be justly considered that while on his deathbed he learned that a person with whom he was at enmity proposed to visit him raise me from my bed said the invalid throw my plaid around me and bring me my claymore dirk and pistols it shall never be said that a foeman saw rob roy macgregor defenceless and unarmed his foeman conjectured to be one of the maclarens before and after mentioned entered and paid his compliments inquiring after the health of his formidable neighbour rob roy maintained a cold haughty civility during their short conference and so soon as he had left the house now he said all is over let the piper play ha til mi tulidh we return no more and he is said to have expired before the dirge was finished this singular man died in bed in his own house in the parish of balquhidder he was buried in the churchyard of the same parish where his tombstone is only distinguished by a rude attempt at the figure of a broadsword the character of rob roy is of course a mixed one his sagacity boldness and prudence qualities so highly necessary to success in war became in some degree vices from the manner in which they were employed the circumstances of his education however must be admitted as some extenuation of his habitual transgressions against the law and for his political tergiversations he might in that distracted period plead the example of men far more powerful and less excusable in becoming the sport of circumstances than the poor and desperate outlaw on the other hand he was in the constant exercise of virtues the more meritorious as they seem inconsistent with his general character pursuing the occupation of a predatory chieftain in modern phrase a captain of banditti rob roy was moderate in his revenge and humane in his successes no charge of cruelty or bloodshed unless in battle is brought against his memory in like manner the formidable outlaw was the friend of the poor and to the utmost of his ability the support of the widow and the orphan kept his word when pledged and died lamented in his own wild country where there were hearts grateful for his beneficence though their minds were not sufficiently instructed to appreciate his errors the author perhaps ought to stop here but the fate of a part of rob roys family was so extraordinary as to call for a continuation of this somewhat prolix account as affording an interesting chapter not on highland manners alone but on every stage of society in which the people of a primitive and halfcivilised tribe are brought into close contact with a nation in which civilisation and polity have attained a complete superiority rob had five sons coll ronald james duncan and robert nothing occurs worth notice concerning three of them but james who was a very handsome man seems to have had a good deal of his fathers spirit and the mantle of dougal ciar mhor had apparently descended on the shoulders of robin oig that is young robin shortly after rob roys death the illwill which the macgregors entertained against the maclarens again broke out at the instigation it was said of robs widow who seems thus far to have deserved the character given to her by her husband as an ate stirring up to blood and strife robin oig under her instigation swore that as soon as he could get back a certain gun which had belonged to his father and had been lately at doune to be repaired he would shoot maclaren for having presumed to settle on his mothers land this fatal piece was taken from robin oig when he was seized many years afterwards it remained in possession of the magistrates before whom he was brought for examination and now makes part of a small collection of arms belonging to the author it is a spanishbarrelled gun marked with the letters r m c for robert macgregor campbell he was as good as his word and shot maclaren when between the stilts of his plough wounding him mortally the aid of a highland leech was procured who probed the wound with a probe made out of a castock ie the stalk of a colewort or cabbage this learned gentleman declared he would not venture to prescribe not knowing with what shot the patient had been wounded maclaren died and about the same time his cattle were houghed and his live stock destroyed in a barbarous manner robin oig after this feat which one of his biographers represents as the unhappy discharge of a gun retired to his mothers house to boast that he had drawn the first blood in the quarrel aforesaid on the approach of troops and a body of the stewarts who were bound to take up the cause of their tenant robin oig absconded and escaped all search the doctor already mentioned by name callam macinleister with james and ronald brothers to the actual perpetrator of the murder were brought to trial but as they contrived to represent the action as a rash deed committed by the daft callant rob to which they were not accessory the jury found their accession to the crime was not proven the alleged acts of spoil and violence on the maclarens cattle were also found to be unsupported by evidence as it was proved however that the two brothers ronald and james were held and reputed thieves they were appointed to find caution to the extent of l for their good behaviour for seven years note d authors expedition against the maclarens the spirit of clanship was at that time so strong to which must be added the wish to secure the adherence of stout ablebodied and as the scotch phrase then went pretty men that the representative of the noble family of perth condescended to act openly as patron of the macgregors and appeared as such upon their trial so at least the author was informed by the late robert macintosh esq advocate the circumstance may however have occurred later than the year in which this first trial took place robin oig served for a time in the d regiment and was present at the battle of fontenoy where he was made prisoner and wounded he was exchanged returned to scotland and obtained his discharge he afterwards appeared openly in the macgregors country and notwithstanding his outlawry married a daughter of graham of drunkie a gentleman of some property his wife died a few years afterwards the insurrection of soon afterwards called the macgregors to arms robert macgregor of glencarnoch generally regarded as the chief of the whole name and grandfather of sir john whom the clan received in that character raised a macgregor regiment with which he joined the standard of the chevalier the race of ciar mhor however affecting independence and commanded by glengyle and his cousin james roy macgregor did not join this kindred corps but united themselves to the levies of the titular duke of perth until william macgregor drummond of bolhaldie whom they regarded as head of their branch of clan alpine should come over from france to cement the union after the highland fashion james laid down the name of campbell and assumed that of drummond in compliment to lord perth he was also called james roy after his father and james mhor or big james from his height his corps the relics of his father robs band behaved with great activity with only twelve men he succeeded in surprising and burning for the second time the fort at inversnaid constructed for the express purpose of bridling the country of the macgregors what rank or command james macgregor had is uncertain he calls himself major and chevalier johnstone calls him captain he must have held rank under ghlune dhu his kinsman but his active and audacious character placed him above the rest of his brethren many of his followers were unarmed he supplied the want of guns and swords with scytheblades set straight upon their handles at the battle of prestonpans james roy distinguished himself his company says chevalier johnstone did great execution with their scythes they cut the legs of the horses in two the riders through the middle of their bodies macgregor was brave and intrepid but at the same time somewhat whimsical and singular when advancing to the charge with his company he received five wounds two of them from balls that pierced his body through and through stretched on the ground with his head resting on his hand he called out loudly to the highlanders of his company my lads i am not dead by g i shall see if any of you does not do his duty the victory as is well known was instantly obtained in some curious letters of james roy it appears that his thighbone was broken on this occasion and that he nevertheless rejoined the army with six companies and was present at the battle of culloden published in blackwoods magazine vol ii p after that defeat the clan macgregor kept together in a body and did not disperse till they had returned into their own country they brought james roy with them in a litter and without being particularly molested he was permitted to reside in the macgregors country along with his brothers james macgregor drummond was attainted for high treason with persons of more importance but it appears he had entered into some communication with government as in the letters quoted he mentions having obtained a pass from the lord justiceclerk in which was a sufficient protection to him from the military the circumstance is obscurely stated in one of the letters already quoted but may perhaps joined to subsequent incidents authorise the suspicion that james like his father could look at both sides of the cards as the confusion of the country subsided the macgregors like foxes which had baffled the hounds drew back to their old haunts and lived unmolested but an atrocious outrage in which the sons of rob roy were concerned brought at length on the family the full vengeance of the law james roy was a married man and had fourteen children but his brother robin oig was now a widower and it was resolved if possible that he should make his fortune by carrying off and marrying by force if necessary some woman of fortune from the lowlands the imagination of the halfcivilised highlanders was less shocked at the idea of this particular species of violence than might be expected from their general kindness to the weaker sex when they make part of their own families but all their views were tinged with the idea that they lived in a state of war and in such a state from the time of the siege of troy to the moment when previsa fell the female captives are to uncivilised victors the most valuable part of the booty childe harolds pilgrimage canto ii the wealthy are slaughtered the lovely are spared we need not refer to the rape of the sabines or to a similar instance in the book of judges for evidence that such deeds of violence have been committed upon a large scale indeed this sort of enterprise was so common along the highland line as to give rise to a variety of songs and ballads see appendix no vi the annals of ireland as well as those of scotland prove the crime to have been common in the more lawless parts of both countries and any woman who happened to please a man of spirit who came of a good house and possessed a few chosen friends and a retreat in the mountains was not permitted the alternative of saying him nay what is more it would seem that the women themselves most interested in the immunities of their sex were among the lower classes accustomed to regard such marriages as that which is presently to be detailed as pretty fannys way or rather the way of donald with pretty fanny it is not a great many years since a respectable woman above the lower rank of life expressed herself very warmly to the author on his taking the freedom to censure the behaviour of the macgregors on the occasion in question she said that there was no use in giving a bride too much choice upon such occasions that the marriages were the happiest long syne which had been done offhand finally she averred that her own mother had never seen her father till the night he brought her up from the lennox with ten head of black cattle and there had not been a happier couple in the country james drummond and his brethren having similar opinions with the authors old acquaintance and debating how they might raise the fallen fortunes of their clan formed a resolution to settle their brothers fortune by striking up an advantageous marriage betwixt robin oig and one jean key or wright a young woman scarce twenty years old and who had been left about two months a widow by the death of her husband her property was estimated at only from to merks but it seems to have been sufficient temptation to these men to join in the commission of a great crime this poor young victim lived with her mother in her own house at edinbilly in the parish of balfron and shire of stirling at this place in the night of d december the sons of rob roy and particularly james mhor and robin oig rushed into the house where the object of their attack was resident presented guns swords and pistols to the males of the family and terrified the women by threatening to break open the doors if jean key was not surrendered as said james roy his brother was a young fellow determined to make his fortune having at length dragged the object of their lawless purpose from her place of concealment they tore her from her mothers arms mounted her on a horse before one of the gang and carried her off in spite of her screams and cries which were long heard after the terrified spectators of the outrage could no longer see the party retreat through the darkness in her attempts to escape the poor young woman threw herself from the horse on which they had placed her and in so doing wrenched her side they then laid her double over the pummel of the saddle and transported her through the mosses and moors till the pain of the injury she had suffered in her side augmented by the uneasiness of her posture made her consent to sit upright in the execution of this crime they stopped at more houses than one but none of the inhabitants dared interrupt their proceedings amongst others who saw them was that classical and accomplished scholar the late professor william richardson of glasgow who used to describe as a terrible dream their violent and noisy entrance into the house where he was then residing the highlanders filled the little kitchen brandishing their arms demanding what they pleased and receiving whatever they demanded james mhor he said was a tall stern and soldierlike man robin oig looked more gentle dark but yet ruddy in complexion a goodlooking young savage their victim was so dishevelled in her dress and forlorn in her appearance and demeanour that he could hardly tell whether she was alive or dead the gang carried the unfortunate woman to rowardennan where they had a priest unscrupulous enough to read the marriage service while james mhor forcibly held the bride up before him and the priest declared the couple man and wife even while she protested against the infamy of his conduct under the same threats of violence which had been all along used to enforce their scheme the poor victim was compelled to reside with the pretended husband who was thus forced upon her they even dared to carry her to the public church of balquhidder where the officiating clergyman the same who had been rob roys pensioner only asked them if they were married persons robert macgregor answered in the affirmative the terrified female was silent the country was now too effectually subjected to the law for this vile outrage to be followed by the advantages proposed by the actors military parties were sent out in every direction to seize the macgregors who were for two or three weeks compelled to shift from one place to another in the mountains bearing the unfortunate jean key along with them in the meanwhile the supreme civil court issued a warrant sequestrating the property of jean key or wright which removed out of the reach of the actors in the violence the prize which they expected they had however adopted a belief of the poor womans spirit being so far broken that she would prefer submitting to her condition and adhering to robin oig as her husband rather than incur the disgrace of appearing in such a cause in an open court it was indeed a delicate experiment but their kinsman glengyle chief of their immediate family was of a temper averse to lawless proceedings and the captives friends having had recourse to his advice they feared that he would withdraw his protection if they refused to place the prisoner at liberty such at least was his general character for when james mhor while perpetrating the violence at edinbilly called out in order to overawe opposition that glengyle was lying in the moor with a hundred men to patronise his enterprise jean key told him he lied since she was confident glengyle would never countenance so scoundrelly a business the brethren resolved therefore to liberate the unhappy woman but previously had recourse to every measure which should oblige her either from fear or otherwise to own her marriage with robin oig the cailliachs old highland hags administered drugs which were designed to have the effect of philtres but were probably deleterious james mhor at one time threatened that if she did not acquiesce in the match she would find that there were enough of men in the highlands to bring the heads of two of her uncles who were pursuing the civil lawsuit at another time he fell down on his knees and confessed he had been accessory to wronging her but begged she would not ruin his innocent wife and large family she was made to swear she would not prosecute the brethren for the offence they had committed and she was obliged by threats to subscribe papers which were tendered to her intimating that she was carried off in consequence of her own previous request james mhor drummond accordingly brought his pretended sisterinlaw to edinburgh where for some little time she was carried about from one house to another watched by those with whom she was lodged and never permitted to go out alone or even to approach the window the court of session considering the peculiarity of the case and regarding jean key as being still under some forcible restraint took her person under their own special charge and appointed her to reside in the family of mr wightman of mauldsley a gentleman of respectability who was married to one of her near relatives two sentinels kept guard on the house day and night a precaution not deemed superfluous when the macgregors were in question she was allowed to go out whenever she chose and to see whomsoever she had a mind as well as the men of law employed in the civil suit on either side when she first came to mr wightmans house she seemed broken down with affright and suffering so changed in features that her mother hardly knew her and so shaken in mind that she scarce could recognise her parent it was long before she could be assured that she was in perfect safely but when she at length received confidence in her situation she made a judicial declaration or affidavit telling the full history of her wrongs imputing to fear her former silence on the subject and expressing her resolution not to prosecute those who had injured her in respect of the oath she had been compelled to take from the possible breach of such an oath though a compulsory one she was relieved by the forms of scottish jurisprudence in that respect more equitable than those of england prosecutions for crimes being always conducted at the expense and charge of the king without inconvenience or cost to the private party who has sustained the wrong but the unhappy sufferer did not live to be either accuser or witness against those who had so deeply injured her james mhor drummond had left edinburgh so soon as his halfdead prey had been taken from his clutches mrs key or wright was released from her species of confinement there and removed to glasgow under the escort of mr wightman as they passed the hill of shotts her escort chanced to say this is a very wild spot what if the macgregors should come upon us god forbid was her immediate answer the very sight of them would kill me she continued to reside at glasgow without venturing to return to her own house at edinbilly her pretended husband made some attempts to obtain an interview with her which she steadily rejected she died on the th october the information for the crown hints that her decease might be the consequence of the usage she received but there is a general report that she died of the smallpox in the meantime james mhor or drummond fell into the hands of justice he was considered as the instigator of the whole affair nay the deceased had informed her friends that on the night of her being carried off robin oig moved by her cries and tears had partly consented to let her return when james came up with a pistol in his hand and asking whether he was such a coward as to relinquish an enterprise in which he had risked everything to procure him a fortune in a manner compelled his brother to persevere jamess trial took place on th july and was conducted with the utmost fairness and impartiality several witnesses all of the macgregor family swore that the marriage was performed with every appearance of acquiescence on the womans part and three or four witnesses one of them sheriffsubstitute of the county swore she might have made her escape if she wished and the magistrate stated that he offered her assistance if she felt desirous to do so but when asked why he in his official capacity did not arrest the macgregors he could only answer that he had not force sufficient to make the attempt the judicial declarations of jean key or wright stated the violent manner in which she had been carried off and they were confirmed by many of her friends from her private communications with them which the event of her death rendered good evidence indeed the fact of her abduction to use a scottish law term was completely proved by impartial witnesses the unhappy woman admitted that she had pretended acquiescence in her fate on several occasions because she dared not trust such as offered to assist her to escape not even the sheriffsubstitute the jury brought in a special verdict finding that jean key or wright had been forcibly carried off from her house as charged in the indictment and that the accused had failed to show that she was herself privy and consenting to this act of outrage but they found the forcible marriage and subsequent violence was not proved and also found in alleviation of the panels guilt in the premises that jean key did afterwards acquiesce in her condition eleven of the jury using the names of other four who were absent subscribed a letter to the court stating it was their purpose and desire by such special verdict to take the panels case out of the class of capital crimes learned informations written arguments on the import of the verdict which must be allowed a very mild one in the circumstances were laid before the high court of justiciary this point is very learnedly debated in these pleadings by mr grant solicitor for the crown and the celebrated mr lockhart on the part of the prisoner but james mhor did not wait the event of the courts decision he had been committed to the castle of edinburgh on some reports that an escape would be attempted yet he contrived to achieve his liberty even from that fortress his daughter had the address to enter the prison disguised as a cobbler bringing home work as she pretended in this cobblers dress her father quickly arrayed himself the wife and daughter of the prisoner were heard by the sentinels scolding the supposed cobbler for having done his work ill and the man came out with his hat slouched over his eyes and grumbling as if at the manner in which they had treated him in this way the prisoner passed all the guards without suspicion and made his escape to france he was afterwards outlawed by the court of justiciary which proceeded to the trial of duncan macgregor or drummond his brother th january the accused had unquestionably been with the party which carried off jean key but no evidence being brought which applied to him individually and directly the jury found him not guilty and nothing more is known of his fate that of james macgregor who from talent and activity if not by seniority may be considered as head of the family has been long misrepresented as it has been generally averred in law reports as well as elsewhere that his outlawry was reversed and that he returned and died in scotland but the curious letters published in blackwoods magazine for december show this to be an error the first of these documents is a petition to charles edward it is dated th september and pleads his service to the cause of the stuarts ascribing his exile to the persecution of the hanoverian government without any allusion to the affair of jean key or the court of justiciary it is stated to be forwarded by macgregor drummond of bohaldie whom as before mentioned james mhor acknowledged as his chief the effect which this petition produced does not appear some temporary relief was perhaps obtained but soon after this daring adventurer was engaged in a very dark intrigue against an exile of his own country and placed pretty nearly in his own circumstances a remarkable highland story must be here briefly alluded to mr campbell of glenure who had been named factor for government on the forfeited estates of stewart of ardshiel was shot dead by an assassin as he passed through the wood of lettermore after crossing the ferry of ballachulish a gentleman named james stewart a natural brother of ardshiel the forfeited person was tried as being accessory to the murder and condemned and executed upon very doubtful evidence the heaviest part of which only amounted to the accused person having assisted a nephew of his own called allan breck stewart with money to escape after the deed was done not satisfied with this vengeance which was obtained in a manner little to the honour of the dispensation of justice at the time the friends of the deceased glenure were equally desirous to obtain possession of the person of allan breck stewart supposed to be the actual homicide james mhor drummond was secretly applied to to trepan stewart to the seacoast and bring him over to britain to almost certain death drummond macgregor had kindred connections with the slain glenure and besides the macgregors and campbells had been friends of late while the former clan and the stewarts had as we have seen been recently at feud lastly robert oig was now in custody at edinburgh and james was desirous to do some service by which his brother might be saved the joint force of these motives may in jamess estimation of right and wrong have been some vindication for engaging in such an enterprise although as must be necessarily supposed it could only be executed by treachery of a gross description macgregor stipulated for a license to return to england promising to bring allan breck thither along with him but the intended victim was put upon his guard by two countrymen who suspected jamess intentions towards him he escaped from his kidnapper after as macgregor alleged robbing his portmanteau of some clothes and four snuffboxes such a charge it may be observed could scarce have been made unless the parties had been living on a footing of intimacy and had access to each others baggage although james drummond had thus missed his blow in the matter of allan breck stewart he used his license to make a journey to london and had an interview as he avers with lord holdernesse his lordship and the undersecretary put many puzzling questions to him and as he says offered him a situation which would bring him bread in the governments service this office was advantageous as to emolument but in the opinion of james drummond his acceptance of it would have been a disgrace to his birth and have rendered him a scourge to his country if such a tempting offer and sturdy rejection had any foundation in fact it probably relates to some plan of espionage on the jacobites which the government might hope to carry on by means of a man who in the matter of allan breck stewart had shown no great nicety of feeling drummond macgregor was so far accommodating as to intimate his willingness to act in any station in which other gentlemen of honour served but not otherwise an answer which compared with some passages of his past life may remind the reader of ancient pistol standing upon his reputation having thus proved intractable as he tells the story to the proposals of lord holdernesse james drummond was ordered instantly to quit england on his return to france his condition seems to have been utterly disastrous he was seized with fever and gravel ill consequently in body and weakened and dispirited in mind allan breck stewart threatened to put him to death in revenge of the designs he had harboured against him note e allan breck stewart the stewart clan were in the highest degree unfriendly to him and his late expedition to london had been attended with many suspicious circumstances amongst which it was not the slightest that he had kept his purpose secret from his chief bohaldie his intercourse with lord holdernesse was suspicious the jacobites were probably like don bernard de castel blaze in gil blas little disposed to like those who kept company with alguazils macdonnell of lochgarry a man of unquestioned honour lodged an information against james drummond before the high bailie of dunkirk accusing him of being a spy so that he found himself obliged to leave that town and come to paris with only the sum of thirteen livres for his immediate subsistence and with absolute beggary staring him in the face we do not offer the convicted common thief the accomplice in maclarens assassination or the manager of the outrage against jean key as an object of sympathy but it is melancholy to look on the dying struggles even of a wolf or a tiger creatures of a species directly hostile to our own and in like manner the utter distress of this man whose faults may have sprung from a wild system of education working on a haughty temper will not be perused without some pity in his last letter to bohaldie dated paris th september he describes his state of destitution as absolute and expresses himself willing to exercise his talents in breaking or breeding horses or as a hunter or fowler if he could only procure employment in such an inferior capacity till something better should occur an englishman may smile but a scotchman will sigh at the postscript in which the poor starving exile asks the loan of his patrons bagpipes that he might play over some of the melancholy tunes of his own land but the effect of music arises in a great degree from association and sounds which might jar the nerves of a londoner or parisian bring back to the highlander his lofty mountain wild lake and the deeds of his fathers of the glen to prove macgregors claim to our readers compassion we here insert the last part of the letter alluded to by all appearance i am born to suffer crosses and it seems theyre not at an end for such is my wretched case at present that i do not know earthly where to go or what to do as i have no subsistence to keep body and soul together all that i have carried here is about livres and have taken a room at my old quarters in hotel st pierre rue de cordier i send you the bearer begging of you to let me know if you are to be in town soon that i may have the pleasure of seeing you for i have none to make application to but you alone and all i want is if it was possible you could contrive where i could be employed without going to entire beggary this probably is a difficult point yet unless its attended with some difficulty you might think nothing of it as your long head can bring about matters of much more difficulty and consequence than this if youd disclose this matter to your friend mr butler its possible he might have some employ wherein i could be of use as i pretend to know as much of breeding and riding of horse as any in france besides that i am a good hunter either on horseback or by footing you may judge my reduction as i propose the meanest things to lend a turn till better cast up i am sorry that i am obliged to give you so much trouble but i hope you are very well assured that i am grateful for what you have done for me and i leave you to judge of my present wretched case i am and shall for ever continue dear chief your own to command jas macgregor p s if youd send your pipes by the bearer and all the other little trinkims belonging to it i would put them in order and play some melancholy tunes which i may now with safety and in real truth forgive my not going directly to you for if i could have borne the seeing of yourself i could not choose to be seen by my friends in my wretchedness nor by any of my acquaintance while macgregor wrote in this disconsolate manner death the sad but sure remedy for mortal evils and decider of all doubts and uncertainties was hovering near him a memorandum on the back of the letter says the writer died about a week after in october it now remains to mention the fate of robin oig for the other sons of rob roy seem to have been no way distinguished robin was apprehended by a party of military from the fort of inversnaid at the foot of gartmore and was conveyed to edinburgh th may after a delay which may have been protracted by the negotiations of james for delivering up allan breck stewart upon promise of his brothers life robin oig on the th of december was brought to the bar of the high court of justiciary and indicted by the name of robert macgregor alias campbell alias drummond alias robert oig and the evidence led against him resembled exactly that which was brought by the crown on the former trial roberts case was in some degree more favourable than his brothers for though the principal in the forcible marriage he had yet to plead that he had shown symptoms of relenting while they were carrying jean key off which were silenced by the remonstrances and threats of his harder natured brother james a considerable space of time had also elapsed since the poor woman died which is always a strong circumstance in favour of the accused for there is a sort of perspective in guilt and crimes of an old date seem less odious than those of recent occurrence but notwithstanding these considerations the jury in roberts case did not express any solicitude to save his life as they had done that of james they found him guilty of being art and part in the forcible abduction of jean key from her own dwelling the trials of the sons of rob roy with anecdotes of himself and his family were published at edinburgh in mo robin oig was condemned to death and executed on the th february at the place of execution he behaved with great decency and professing himself a catholic imputed all his misfortunes to his swerving from the true church two or three years before he confessed the violent methods he had used to gain mrs key or wright and hoped his fate would stop further proceedings against his brother james james died near three months before but his family might easily remain a long time without the news of that event the newspapers observed that his body after hanging the usual time was delivered to his friends to be carried to the highlands to this the recollection of a venerable friend recently taken from us in the fulness of years then a schoolboy at linlithgow enables the author to add that a much larger body of macgregors than had cared to advance to edinburgh received the corpse at that place with the coronach and other wild emblems of highland mourning and so escorted it to balquhidder thus we may conclude this long account of rob roy and his family with the classic phrase ite conclamatum est i have only to add that i have selected the above from many anecdotes of rob roy which were and may still be current among the mountains where he flourished but i am far from warranting their exact authenticity clannish partialities were very apt to guide the tongue and pen as well as the pistol and claymore and the features of an anecdote are wonderfully softened or exaggerated as the story is told by a macgregor or a campbell appendix to introduction no i advertisement for the apprehension of rob roy from the edinburgh evening courant june to june ad no that robert campbell commonly known by the name of rob roy macgregor being lately intrusted by several noblemen and gentlemen with considerable sums for buying cows for them in the highlands has treacherously gone off with the money to the value of l sterling which he carries along with him all magistrates and officers of his majestys forces are intreated to seize upon the said rob roy and the money which he carries with him until the persons concerned in the money be heard against him and that notice be given when he is apprehended to the keepers of the exchange coffeehouse at edinburgh and the keeper of the coffeehouse at glasgow where the parties concerned will be advertised and the seizers shall be very reasonably rewarded for their pains it is unfortunate that this hue and cry which is afterwards repeated in the same paper contains no description of rob roys person which of course we must suppose to have been pretty generally known as it is directed against rob roy personally it would seem to exclude the idea of the cattle being carried off by his partner macdonald who would certainly have been mentioned in the advertisement if the creditors concerned had supposed him to be in possession of the money no ii letters from and to the duke of montrose respecting rob roys arrest of mr grahame of killearn the duke of montrose to it does not appear to whom this letter was addressed certainly from its style and tenor it was designed for some person high in rank and office perhaps the kings advocate for the time glasgow the st november my lord i was surprised last night with the account of a very remarkable instance of the insolence of that very notorious rogue rob roy whom your lordship has often heard named the honour of his majestys government being concerned in it i thought it my duty to acquaint your lordship of the particulars by an express mr grahame of killearn whom i have had occasion to mention frequently to you for the good service he did last winter during the rebellion having the charge of my highland estate went to monteath which is a part of it on monday last to bring in my rents it being usual for him to be there for two or three nights together at this time of the year in a country house for the conveniency of meeting the tenants upon that account the same night about of the clock rob roy with a party of those ruffians whom he has still kept about him since the late rebellion surrounded the house where mr grahame was with some of my tenants doing his business ordered his men to present their guns in att the windows of the room where he was sitting while he himself at the same time with others entered at the door with cocked pistols and made mr grahame prisoner carrying him away to the hills with the money he had got his books and papers and my tenants bonds for their fines amounting to above a thousand pounds sterling whereof the onehalf had been paid last year and the other was to have been paid now and att the same time had the insolence to cause him to write a letter to me the copy of which is enclosed offering me terms of a treaty that your lordship may have the better view of this matter it will be necessary that i should inform you that this fellow has now of a long time put himself at the head of the clan mgregor a race of people who in all ages have distinguished themselves beyond others by robberies depredations and murders and have been the constant harbourers and entertainers of vagabonds and loose people from the time of the revolution he has taken every opportunity to appear against the government acting rather as a robber than doing any real service to those whom he pretended to appear for and has really done more mischief to the countrie than all the other highlanders have done some three or four years before the last rebellion broke out being overburdened with debts he quitted his ordinary residence and removed some twelve or sixteen miles farther into the highlands putting himself under the protection of the earl of bredalbin when my lord cadogan was in the highlands he ordered his house att this place to be burnt which your lordship sees he now places to my account this obliges him to return to the same countrie he went from being a most rugged inaccessible place where he took up his residence anew amongst his own friends and relations but well judging that it was possible to surprise him he with about fortyfive of his followers went to inverary and made a sham surrender of their arms to coll campbell of finab commander of one of the independent companies and returned home with his men each of them having the colls protection this happened in the beginning of summer last yet not long after he appeared with his men twice in arms in opposition to the kings troops and one of those times attackt them rescued a prisoner from them and all this while sent abroad his party through the countrie plundering the countrie people and amongst the rest some of my tenants being informed of these disorders after i came to scotland i applied to lieutgenll carpenter who ordered three parties from glasgow stirling and finlarig to march in the night by different routes in order to surprise him and his men in their houses which would have its effect certainly if the great rains that happened to fall that verie night had not retarded the march of the troops so as some of the parties came too late to the stations that they were ordered for all that could be done upon the occasion was to burn a countrie house where rob roy then resided after some of his clan had from the rocks fired upon the kings troops by which a grenadier was killed mr grahame of killearn being my deputysheriff in that countrie went along with the party that marched from stirling and doubtless will now meet with the worse treatment from that barbarous people on that account besides that he is my relation and that they know how active he has been in the service of the government all which your lordship may believe puts me under very great concern for the gentleman while at the same time i can foresee no manner of way how to relieve him other than to leave him to chance and his own management i had my thoughts before of proposing to government the building of some barracks as the only expedient for suppressing these rebels and securing the peace of the countrie and in that view i spoke to genll carpenter who has now a scheme of it in his hands and i am persuaded that will be the true method for restraining them effectually but in the meantime it will be necessary to lodge some of the troops in those places upon which i intend to write to the generall i am sensible i have troubled your lordship with a very long letter which i should be ashamed of were i myself singly concerned but where the honour of the kings government is touched i need make no apologie and i shall only beg leave to add that i am with great respect and truth my lord yr lords most humble and obedient servant montrose copy of grahame of killearns letter enclosed in the preceding chappellarroch nov th may it please your grace i am obliged to give your grace the trouble of this by robert

that your grace shall discharge him of all soumes he owes your grace and give him the soume of merks for his loss and damages sustained by him both at craigrostown and at his house auchinchisallen and that your grace shall give your word not to trouble or prosecute him afterwards till which time he carries me all the money i received this day my books and bonds for entress not yet paid along with

nov sir having acquainted you by my last of the st instant of what had happened to my friend mr grahame of killearn im very glad now to tell you that last night i was very agreeably surprised with mr grahames coming here himself and giving me the first account i had had of him from the time of his being carried away it seems rob roy when he came to consider a little better of it found that he could not mend his matters by retaining killearn his prisoner which could only expose him still the more to the justice of the government and therefore thought fit to dismiss him on sunday evening last having kept him from the monday night before under a very uneasy kind of restraint being obliged to change continually from place to place he gave him back the books papers and bonds but kept the money i am with great truth sir your most humble servant montrose some papers connected with rob roy macgregor signed ro campbell in were lately presented to the society of antiquaries one of these is a kind of contract between the duke of montrose and rob roy by which the latter undertakes to deliver within a given time sixtie good and sufficient kintaill highland cowes betwixt the age of five and

challenge by rob roy rob roy to ain hie and mighty prince james duke of montrose in charity to your graces couradge and conduct please know the only way to retrive both is to treat rob roy like himself in appointing tyme place and choice of arms that at once you may extirpate your inveterate enemy or put a period to your punny puny life in falling gloriously by his hands that impertinent criticks or flatterers may not brand me for challenging a man thats repute of a poor dastardly soul let such know that i admit of the two great supporters of his character and the captain of his bands to joyne with him in the combat then sure your grace wont have the impudence to clamour att court for multitudes to hunt me like a fox under pretence that i am not to be found above ground this saves your grace and the troops any further trouble of searching that is if your ambition of glory press you to embrace this unequald venture offerd of robs head but if your graces piety prudence and cowardice forbids hazarding this gentlemanly expedient then let your desire of peace restore what you have robed from me by the tyranny of your present cituation otherwise your overthrow as a man is determined and advertise your friends never more to look for the frequent civility payed them of sending them home without their arms only even their former cravings wont purchase that favour so your

the envelope that rob roy still continued to act as intelligencer to the duke of argyle and his agents the war he alludes to is probably some vague report of invasion from spain such rumours were likely enough to be afloat in consequence of the disembarkation of the troops who were taken at glensheal in the preceding year no iv letter from robert campbell alias mgregor commonly called rob roy to fieldmarshal wade then receiving the submission of disaffected chieftains and clans this curious epistle is copied from an authentic narrative of marshal wades proceedings in the highlands communicated by the late eminent antiquary george chalmers esq to mr robert jamieson of the register house edinburgh and published in the appendix to an edition of burts letters from the north of scotland vols vo edinburgh sir the great humanity with which you have constantly acted in the discharge of the trust reposed in you and your ever having made use of the great powers with which you were vested as the means of doing good and charitable offices to such as ye found proper objects of compassion will i hope excuse my importunity in endeavouring to approve myself not absolutely unworthy of that mercy and favour which your excellency has so generously procured from his majesty for others in my unfortunate circumstances i am very sensible nothing can be alledged sufficient to excuse so great a crime as i have been guilty of it that of rebellion but i humbly beg leave to lay before your excellency some particulars in the circumstance of my guilt which i hope will extenuate it in some measure it was my misfortune at the time the rebellion broke out to be liable to legal diligence and caption at the duke of montroses instance for debt alledged due to him to avoid being flung into prison as i must certainly have been had i followed my real inclinations in joining the kings troops at stirling i was forced to take party with the adherents of the pretender for the country being all in arms it was neither safe nor indeed possible for me to stand neuter i should not however plead my being forced into that unnatural rebellion against his majesty king george if i could not at the same time assure your excellency that i not only avoided acting offensively against his majestys forces upon all occasions but on the contrary sent his grace the duke of argyle all the intelligence i could from time to time of the strength and situation of the rebels which i hope his grace will do me the justice to acknowledge as to the debt to the duke of montrose i have discharged it to the utmost farthing i beg your excellency would be persuaded that had it been in my power as it was in my inclination i should always have acted for the service of his majesty king george and that one reason of my begging the favour of your intercession with his majesty for the pardon of my life is the earnest desire i have to employ it in his service whose goodness justice and humanity are so conspicuous to all mankind i am with all duty and respect your excellencys most c robert campbell no iva letter escape of rob roy from the duke of athole the following copy of a letter

wooing there are many productions of the scottish ballad poets upon the lionlike mode of wooing practised by the ancient highlanders when they had a fancy for the person or property of a lowland damsel one example is found in mr robert jamiesons popular scottish songs bonny babby livingstone gaed out to see the kye and she has met with glenlyon who has stolen her away he took free her her sattin coat but an her silken gown syne roud her in his tartan plaid and happd her round and roun in another ballad we are told how fourandtwenty hieland men came doun by fiddoch bide and they have sworn a deadly aith jean muir suld be a bride and they have sworn a deadly aith ilke man upon his durke that she should wed with duncan ger or theyd make bloody works this last we have from tradition but there are many others in the collections of scottish ballads to the same purpose the achievement of robert oig or young rob roy as the lowlanders called him was celebrated in a ballad of which there are twenty different and various editions the tune is lively and wild and we select the following words from memory rob roy is frae the hielands come down to the lowland border and he has stolen that lady away to haud his house in order he set her on a milkwhite steed of none he stood in awe untill they reached the hieland hills aboon the balmaha a pass on the eastern margin of loch lomond and an entrance to the highlands saying be content be content be content with me lady where will ye find in lennox land sae braw a man as me lady rob roy he was my father called macgregor was his name lady a the country far and near have heard macgregors fame lady he was a hedge about his friends a heckle to his foes lady if any man did him gainsay he felt his deadly blows lady i am as bold i am as bold i am as bold and more lady any man that doubts my word may try my gude claymore lady then be content be content be content with me lady for now you are my wedded wife until the day you die lady no vi ghlune dhu the following notices concerning this chief fell under the authors eye while the sheets were in the act of going through the press they occur in manuscript memoirs written by a person intimately acquainted with the incidents of this chief had the important task intrusted to him of defending the castle of doune in which the chevalier placed a garrison to protect his communication with the highlands and to repel any sallies which might be made from stirling castle ghlune dhu distinguished himself by his good conduct in this charge ghlune dhu is thus described glengyle is in person a tall handsome man and has more of the mien of the ancient heroes than our modern fine gentlemen are possessed of he is honest and disinterested to a proverb extremely modest brave and intrepid and born one of the best partisans in europe in short the whole people of that country declared that never did men live under so mild a government as glengyles not a man having so much as lost a chicken while he continued there it would appear from this curious passage that glengyle not stewart of balloch as averred in a note on waverley commanded the garrison of doune balloch might no doubt succeed macgregor in the situation editors introduction to rob roy in the magnum opus the authors final edition of the waverley novels rob roy appears out of its chronological order and comes next after the antiquary in this as in other matters the present edition follows that of the antiquary as we said contained in its preface the authors farewell to his art this valediction was meant as prelude to a fresh appearance in a new disguise constable who had brought out the earlier works did not publish the tales of my landlord the black dwarf and old mortality which scott had nearly finished by november the four volumes appeared from the houses of mr murray and mr blackwood on december within less than a month came out harold the dauntless by the author of the bridal of triermain scotts work on the historical part of the annual register had also been unusually arduous at abbotsford or at ashiestiel his mode of life was particularly healthy in edinburgh between the claims of the courts of literature and of society he was scarcely ever in the open air thus hard sedentary work caused between the publication of old mortality and that of rob roy the first of those alarming illnesses which overshadowed the last fifteen years of his life the earliest attack of cramp in the stomach occurred on march when he retired from the room with a scream of agony which electrified his guests living on parritch as he tells miss baillie for his national spirit rejected arrowroot scott had yet energy enough to plan a dramatic piece for terry the doom of devorgoil but in april he announced to john ballantyne a good subject for a novel and on may john after a visit to abbotsford with constable proclaimed to james ballantyne the advent of rob roy the anecdote about the title is well known constable suggested it and scott was at first wisely reluctant to write up to a title names like rob roy queen mary queen elizabeth cleopatra and so forth tell the reader too much and scott imagined often excite hopes which cannot be fulfilled however in the geniality of an afterdinner hour in the gardens of abbotsford scott allowed constable to be sponsor many things had lately brought rob into his mind in scott had acquired rob roys gun a long spanishbarrelled piece with his initials r m c c standing for campbell a name assumed in compliment to the argyll family robs spleuchan had also been presented by mr train to sir walter in and may have directed his thoughts to this popular freebooter though rob flourished in the he was really a character very near scott whose friend invernahyle had fought rob with broadsword and target a courteous combat like that between ajax and hector at tullibody scott had met in a gentleman who once visited rob and arranged to pay him blackmail mr william adam had mentioned to scott in the use of the word curliewurlies for highly decorated architecture and recognised the phrase next year in the mouth of andrew fairservice in the meeting at abbotsford may scott was very communicative sketched bailie nicol jarvie and improvised a dialogue between rob and the magistrate a week later he quoted to southey swifts lines too bad for a blessing too good for a curse which probably suggested andrew fairservices final estimate of scotts hero over bad for blessing and ower gude for banning these are the trifles which show the bent of scotts mind at this period the summer of he spent in working at the annual register and at the border antiquities when the courts rose he visited robs cave at the head of loch lomond and this visit seems to have been gossiped about as literary people hearing of the new novel expected the cave to be a very prominent feature he also went to glasgow and refreshed his memory of the cathedral nor did he neglect old books such as a tour through great britain by a gentleman th edition this yielded him the bailies account of glasgow commerce in musselburgh stuffs and edinburgh shalloons and the phrase sortable cargoes hence too scott took the description of the rise of glasgow thus scott was taking pains with his preparations the book was not written in posthaste announced to constable early in may the last sheet was not corrected till about december when scott wrote to ballantyne dear james with great joy i send you roy t was a tough job but were done with rob rob roy was published on the last day of the toughness of the job was caused by constant pain and by struggles with the lassitude of opium so seldom sentimental so rarely given to expressing his melancholy moods in verse scott while composing rob roy wrote the beautiful poem the sun upon the weirdlaw hill in which for this once pity of self through all makes broken moan some stress may be laid on the state of sir walters health at this moment because a living critic has tried to show that in his case every pang of the stomach paralyses the brain that he never had a fit of the cramp without spoiling a chapter mr ruskins fiction fair and foul nineteenth century p rob roy is a sufficient answer to these theories the mind of scott was no slave to his body the success of the story is pleasantly proved by a sentence in a review of the day it is an event unprecedented in the annals either of literature or of the customhouse that the entire cargo of a packet or smack bound from leith to london should be the impression of a novel for which the public curiosity was so much upon the alert as to require this immense importation to satisfy ten thousand copies of a threevolume novel are certainly a ponderous cargo and constable printed no fewer in his first edition scott was assured of his own triumph in february when a dramatised version of his novel was acted in edinburgh by the company of mr william murray a descendant of the traitor murray of broughton mr charles mackay made a capital bailie and the piece remains a favourite with scotch audiences it is plain from the reviews that in one respect rob roy rather disappointed the world they had expected rob to be a much more imposing and majestic cateran and complained that his foot was set too late on his native heather they found too much of the drover and intriguer too little of the traditional driver of the spoil this was what scott foresaw when he objected to writing up to a title in fact he did not write up to it and as the scots magazine said shaped his story in such a manner as to throw busybodies out in their chase with a slight degree of malicious finesse all the expeditions to the wonderful cave have been thrown away for the said cave is not once we think mentioned from beginning to end rob roy equals waverley in its pictures of highland and lowland society and character scott had clearly set himself to state his opinions about the highlands as they were under the patriarchal system of government the highlanders were then a people not lawless indeed but all their law was the will of their chief bailie nicol jarvie makes a statement of their economic and military condition as accurate as it is humorous the modern highland question may be studied as well in the bailies words as in volumes of history and wildernesses of bluebooks a people patriarchal and military as the arabs of the desert were suddenly dragged into modern commercial and industrial society all old bonds were snapped in a moment emigration at first opposed by some of the chiefs and the french wars depleted the country of its langleggit callants gaun wanting the breeks cattle took the place of men sheep of cattle deer of sheep and in the long peace a population grew up again a population destitute of employment even more than of old because war and robbery had ceased to be outlets for its energy some chiefs as dr johnson said treated their lands as an attorney treats his row of cheap houses in a town hence the highland question a question in which scotts sympathies were with the highlanders rob roy naturally is no mere novel with a purpose no economic tract in disguise among scotts novels it stands alone as regards its pictures of passionate love the love of diana vernon is no less passionate for its admirable restraint here scott displays without affectation a truly greek reserve in his art the deep and strong affection of diana vernon would not have been otherwise handled by him who drew the not more immortal picture of antigone unlike modern novelists sir walter deals neither in analysis nor in rapturous effusions we can unfortunately imagine but too easily how some writers would peep and pry into the concealed emotions of that maiden heart how others would revel in tears kisses and caresses in place of all these scott writes she extended her hand but i clasped her to my bosom she sighed as she extricated herself from the embrace which she permitted escaped to the door which led to her own apartment and i saw her no more months pass in a mist of danger and intrigue before the lovers meet again in the dusk and the solitude mr francis osbaldistone cries the girls voice through the moonlight should not whistle his favourite airs when he wishes to remain undiscovered and diana vernon for she wrapped in a horsemans cloak was the last speaker whistled in playful mimicry the second part of the tune which was on my lips when they came up surely there was never in story or in song a lady so loving and so light of heart save rosalind alone her face touches franks as she says goodbye for ever it was a moment never to be forgotten inexpressibly bitter yet mixed with a sensation of pleasure so deeply soothing and affecting as at once to unlock all the floodgates of the heart she rides into the night her lover knows the hysterica passio of poor lear but i had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm ere i was ashamed of my weakness these were men and women who knew how to love and how to live all men who read rob roy are innocent rivals of frank osbaldistone di vernon holds her place in our hearts with rosalind and these airy affections like the actual emotions which they mimic are not matters for words this lady so gay so brave so witty and fearless so tender and true who endured trials which might have dignified the history of a martyr who spent the day in darkness and the night in vigil and never breathed a murmur of weakness or complaint is as immortal in mens memories as the actual heroine of the white rose flora macdonald her place is with helen and antigone with rosalind and imogen the deathless daughters of dreams she brightens the world as she passes and our own hearts tell us all the story when osbaldistone says you know how i lamented her in the central interest which for once is the interest of love rob roy attains the nobility the reserve the grave dignity of the highest art it is not easy to believe that frank osbaldistone is worthy of his lady but here no man is a fair judge in the four novels waverley guy mannering the antiquary and rob roy which we have studied the hero has always been a young poet waverley versified so did mannering lovel had attempted a few lyrical pieces and in osbaldistones rhymes scott parodied his own blast of that dread horn on fontarabian echoes borne all the heroes then have been poets and osbaldistones youth may have been suggested by scotts memories of his own and of the father who feared that he would never be better than a gangrel scrapegut like henry morton in old mortality frank osbaldistone is on the political side taken by scotts judgment not by his emotions to make di vernon convert him to jacobitism would have been to repeat the story of waverley still he would have been more sympathetic if he had been converted he certainly does not lack spirit as a sportsman or on an occasion as sir william hope says in the scots fencing master when he encounters rashleigh in the college gardens frank in short is all that a hero should be and is glorified by his affection of the other characters perhaps rob roy is too sympathetically drawn the materials for a judgment are afforded by scotts own admirable historical introduction the rob roy who so calmly played booty and kept a foot in either camp certainly falls below the heroic his language has been criticised in late years and it has been insisted that the highlanders never talked lowland scotch but scott has anticipated these cavils in the eighteenth chapter of the second volume certainly no lowlander knew the highlanders better than he did and his ear for dialect was as keen as his musical ear was confessedly obtuse scott had the best means of knowing whether helen macgregor would be likely to soar into heroics as she is apt to do in fact here we may trust the artist the novel is as rich as any in subordinate characters full of life and humour morris is one of the few utter cowards in scott he has none of the passionate impulses towards courage of the hapless hero in the fair maid of perth the various osbaldistones are nicely discriminated by diana vernon in one of those beatrix moods which scott did not always admire when they were displayed by lady anne and other girls of flesh and blood rashleigh is of a nature unusual in scott he is perhaps sir walters nearest approach for malignant egotism to an iago of bailie nicol jarvie commendation were impertinent all scotland arose called him hers laughed at and applauded her civic child concerning andrew fairservice the first edition tells us what the final edition leaves us to guess that tresham may recollect him as gardener at osbaldistone hall andrew was not a friend who could be shaken off diana may have ruled the hall but andrew must have remained absolute in the gardens with something to maw that he would like to see mawn or something to saw that he would like to see sawn or something to ripe that he would like to see ripen and sae he een daikered on wi the family frae years end to years end and lifes end his master needed some carefu body to look after him only shakspeare and scott could have given us medicines to make us like this cowardly conceited jimp honest fellow andrew fairservice who just escapes being a hypocrite by dint of some sincere old covenanting leaven in his veins we make bold to say that the creator of parolles and lucie and many another lax and lovable knave would had he been a scot have drawn andrew fairservice thus and not otherwise the critics of the hour censured as they were certain to censure the construction and especially the conclusion of rob roy no doubt the critics were right in both scott and shakspeare there is often seen a perfect disregard of the denouement any moderately intelligent person can remark on the huddledup ends and hasty marriages in many of shakspeares comedies moliere has been charged with the same offence and if blame there be scott is almost always to blame thackeray is little better there must be some reason that explains why men of genius go wrong where every newspaper critic every milliners girl acquainted with circulating libraries can detect the offence in the closing remarks of old mortality scott expresses himself humorously on this matter of the denouement his schoolmaster author takes his proofsheets to miss martha buskbody who was the literary set in gandercleugh having read through the whole stock of three circulating libraries miss buskbody criticises the dominic as lady louisa stuart habitually criticised sir walter your plan of omitting a formal conclusion will never do the dominie replies really madam you must be aware that every volume of a narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a conclusion just like your tea which though excellent hyson is necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup he compares the orthodox happy ending to the luscious lump of halfdissolved sugar usually found at the bottom of the cup this topic might be discussed and indeed has been discussed endlessly in our actual lives it is probable that most of us have found ourselves living for a year or a month or a week in a chapter or half a volume of a novel and these have been our least happy experiences but we have also found that the romance vanishes away like a ghost dwindles out closes with ragged ends has no denouement then the question presents itself as art is imitation should not novels as a rule close thus the experiment has frequently been tried especially by the modern geniuses who do not conceal their belief that their art is altogether finer than scotts or perhaps than shakspeares in his practice and in his dominies critical remarks sir walter appears inclined to agree with them he was just as well aware as his reviewers or as lady louisa stuart that the conclusion of rob roy is huddled up that the sudden demise of all the young baldistones is a highhanded measure he knew that in real life frank and di vernon would never have met again after that farewell on the moonlit road but he yielded to miss buskbodys demand for a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter he understood the human liking for the final lump of sugar after all fiction is not any more than any other art a mere imitation of life it is an arrangement a selection scott was too kind too humane to disappoint us the crowd of human beings who find much of our happiness in dreams he could not keep up his own interest in his characters after he had developed them he could take pleasure in giving them life he had little pleasure in ushering them into an earthly paradise so that part of his business he did carelessly as his only rivals in literature have also done it the critics censured not unjustly the machinery of the story these mysterious assets of osbaldistone and tresham whose absence was to precipitate the rising of the edinburgh review lost its heart jeffreys heart was always being lost to di vernon but it pronounces that a king with legs of marble or a youth with an ivory shoulder heroes of the arabian nights and of pindar was probable compared with the wit and accomplishments of diana this is hypercriticism dianas education under rashleigh had been elaborate her acquaintance with shakspeare her main strength is unusual in women but not beyond the limits of belief here she is in agreeable contrast to rose bradwardine who had never heard of romeo and juliet in any case diana compels belief as well as wins affection while we are fortunate enough to be in her delightful company as long as we believe in her it is not of moment to consider whether her charms are incompatible with probability rob roy was finished in spite of a very bad touch of the cramp for about three weeks in november which with its natural attendants of dulness and weakness made me unable to get our matters forward till last week says scott to constable but adds the unconquerable author i am resting myself here a few days before commencing my new labours which will be untrodden ground and i think pretty likely to succeed the new labours were the heart of midlothian andrew lang rob roy volume one chapter first how have i sinnd that this affliction should light so heavy on me i have no more sons and this no more mine own my grand curse hang oer his head that thus transformed thee travel ill send my horse to travel next monsieur thomas you have requested me my dear friend to bestow some of that leisure with which providence has blessed the decline of my life in registering the hazards and difficulties which attended its commencement the recollection of those adventures as you are pleased to term them has indeed left upon my mind a chequered and varied feeling of pleasure and of pain mingled i trust with no slight gratitude and veneration to the disposer of human events who guided my early course through much risk and labour that the ease with which he has blessed my prolonged life might seem softer from remembrance and contrast neither is it possible for me to doubt what you have often affirmed that the incidents which befell me among a people singularly primitive in their government and manners have something interesting and attractive for those who love to hear an old mans stories of a past age still however you must remember that the tale told by one friend and listened to by another loses half its charms when committed to paper and that the narratives to which you have attended with interest as heard from the voice of him to whom they occurred will appear less deserving of attention when perused in the seclusion of your study but your greener age and robust constitution promise longer life than will in all human probability be the lot of your friend throw then these sheets into some secret drawer of your escritoire till we are separated from each others society by an event which may happen at any moment and which must happen within the course of a few a very few years when we are parted in this world to meet i hope in a better you will i am well aware cherish more than it deserves the memory of your departed friend and will find in those details which i am now to commit to paper matter for melancholy but not unpleasing reflection others bequeath to the confidants of their bosom portraits of their external features i put into your hands a faithful transcript of my thoughts and feelings of my virtues and of my failings with the assured hope that the follies and headstrong impetuosity of my youth will meet the same kind construction and forgiveness which have so often attended the faults of my matured age one advantage among the many of addressing my memoirs if i may give these sheets a name so imposing to a dear and intimate friend is that i may spare some of the details in this case unnecessary with which i must needs have detained a stranger from what i have to say of greater interest why should i bestow all my tediousness upon you because i have you in my power and have ink paper and time before me at the same time i dare not promise that i may not abuse the opportunity so temptingly offered me to treat of myself and my own concerns even though i speak of circumstances as well known to you as to myself the seductive love of narrative when we ourselves are the heroes of the events which we tell often disregards the attention due to the time and patience of the audience and the best and wisest have yielded to its fascination i need only remind you of the singular instance evinced by the form of that rare and original edition of sullys memoirs which you with the fond vanity of a bookcollector insist upon preferring to that which is reduced to the useful and ordinary form of memoirs but which i think curious solely as illustrating how far so great a man as the author was accessible to the foible of selfimportance if i recollect rightly that venerable peer and great statesman had appointed no fewer than four gentlemen of his household to draw up the events of his life under the title of memorials of the sage and royal affairs of state domestic political and military transacted by henry iv and so forth these grave recorders having made their compilation reduced the memoirs containing all the remarkable events of their masters life into a narrative addressed to himself in propria persona and thus instead of telling his own story in the third person like julius caesar or in the first person like most who in the hall or the study undertake to be the heroes of their own tale sully enjoyed the refined though whimsical pleasure of having the events of his life told over to him by his secretaries being himself the auditor as he was also the hero and probably the author of the whole book it must have been a great sight to have seen the exminister as bolt upright as a starched ruff and laced cassock could make him seated in state beneath his canopy and listening to the recitation of his compilers while standing bare in his presence they informed him gravely thus said the duke so did the duke infer such were your graces sentiments upon this important point such were your secret counsels to the king on that other emergency circumstances all of which must have been much better known to their hearer than to themselves and most of which could only be derived from his own special communication my situation is not quite so ludicrous as that of the great sully and yet there would be something whimsical in frank osbaldistone giving will tresham a formal account of his birth education and connections in the world i will therefore wrestle with the tempting spirit of p p clerk of our parish as i best may and endeavour to tell you nothing that is familiar to you already some things however i must recall to your memory because though formerly well known to you they may have been forgotten through lapse of time and they afford the groundwork of my destiny you must remember my father well for as your own was a member of the mercantile house you knew him from infancy yet you hardly saw him in his best days before age and infirmity had quenched his ardent spirit of enterprise and speculation he would have been a poorer man indeed but perhaps as happy had he devoted to the extension of science those active energies and acute powers of observation for which commercial pursuits found occupation yet in the fluctuations of mercantile speculation there is something captivating to the adventurer even independent of the hope of gain he who embarks on that fickle sea requires to possess the skill of the pilot and the fortitude of the navigator and after all may be wrecked and lost unless the gales of fortune breathe in his favour this mixture of necessary attention and inevitable hazard the frequent and awful uncertainty whether prudence shall overcome fortune or fortune baffle the schemes of prudence affords full occupation for the powers as well as for the feelings of the mind and trade has all the fascination of gambling without its moral guilt early in the th century when i heaven help me was a youth of some twenty years old i was summoned suddenly from bourdeaux to attend my father on business of importance i shall never forget our first interview you recollect the brief abrupt and somewhat stern mode in which he was wont to communicate his pleasure to those around him methinks i see him even now in my minds eye the firm and upright figure the step quick and determined the eye which shot so keen and so penetrating a glance the features on which care had already planted wrinkles and hear his language in which he never wasted word in vain expressed in a voice which had sometimes an occasional harshness far from the intention of the speaker when i dismounted from my posthorse i hastened to my fathers apartment he was traversing it with an air of composed and steady deliberation which even my arrival although an only son unseen for four years was unable to discompose i threw myself into his arms he was a kind though not a fond father and the tear twinkled in his dark eye but it was only for a moment dubourg writes to me that he is satisfied with you frank i am happy sir but i have less reason to be so he added sitting down at his bureau i am sorry sir sorry and happy frank are words that on most occasions signify little or nothing here is your last letter he took it out from a number of others tied up in a parcel of red tape and curiously labelled and filed there lay my poor epistle written on the subject the nearest to my heart at the time and couched in words which i had thought would work compassion if not conviction there i say it lay squeezed up among the letters on miscellaneous business in which my fathers daily affairs had engaged him i cannot help smiling internally when i recollect the mixture of hurt vanity and wounded feeling with which i regarded my remonstrance to the penning of which there had gone i promise you some trouble as i beheld it extracted from amongst letters of advice of credit and all the commonplace lumber as i then thought them of a merchants correspondence surely thought i a letter of such importance i dared not say even to myself so well written deserved a separate place as well as more anxious consideration than those on the ordinary business of the countinghouse but my father did not observe my dissatisfaction and would not have minded it if he had he proceeded with the letter in his hand this frank is yours of the st ultimo in which you advise me reading from my letter that in the most important business of forming a plan and adopting a profession for life you trust my paternal goodness will hold you entitled to at least a negative voice that you have insuperable ay insuperable is the word i wish by the way you would write a more distinct current hand draw a score through the tops of your ts and open the loops of your ls insuperable objections to the arrangements which i have proposed to you there is much more to the same effect occupying four good pages of paper which a little attention to perspicuity and distinctness of expression might have comprised within as many lines for after all frank it amounts but to this that you will not do as i would have you that i cannot sir in the present instance not that i will not words avail very little with me young man said my father whose inflexibility always possessed the air of the most perfect calmness of selfpossession can not may be a more civil phrase than will not but the expressions are synonymous where there is no moral impossibility but i am not a friend to doing business hastily we will talk this matter over after dinner owen owen appeared not with the silver locks which you were used to venerate for he was then little more than fifty but he had the same or an exactly similar uniform suit of lightbrown clothes the same pearlgrey silk stockings the same stock with its silver buckle the same plaited cambric ruffles drawn down over his knuckles in the parlour but in the countinghouse carefully folded back under the sleeves that they might remain unstained by the ink which he daily consumed in a word the same grave formal yet benevolent cast of features which continued to his death to distinguish the head clerk of the great house of osbaldistone and tresham owen said my father as the kind old man shook me affectionately by the hand you must dine with us today and hear the news frank has brought us from our friends in bourdeaux owen made one of his stiff bows of respectful gratitude for in those days when the distance between superiors and inferiors was enforced in a manner to which the present times are strangers such an invitation was a favour of some little consequence i shall long remember that dinnerparty deeply affected by feelings of anxiety not unmingled with displeasure i was unable to take that active share in the conversation which my father seemed to expect from me and i too frequently gave unsatisfactory answers to the questions with which he assailed me owen hovering betwixt his respect for his patron and his love for the youth he had dandled on his knee in childhood like the timorous yet anxious ally of an invaded nation endeavoured at every blunder i made to explain my nomeaning and to cover my retreat manoeuvres which added to my fathers pettish displeasure and brought a share of it upon my kind advocate instead of protecting me i had not while residing in the house of dubourg absolutely conducted myself like a clerk condemnd his fathers soul to cross who pennd a stanza when he should engross but to say truth i had frequented the countinghouse no more than i had thought absolutely necessary to secure the good report of the frenchman long a correspondent of our firm to whom my father had trusted for initiating me into the mysteries of commerce in fact my principal attention had been dedicated to literature and manly exercises my father did not altogether discourage such acquirements whether mental or personal he had too much good sense not to perceive that they sate gracefully upon every man and he was sensible that they relieved and dignified the character to which he wished me to aspire but his chief ambition was that i should succeed not merely to his fortune but to the views and plans by which he imagined he could extend and perpetuate the wealthy inheritance which he designed for me love of his profession was the motive which he chose should be most ostensible when he urged me to tread the same path but he had others with which i only became acquainted at a later period impetuous in his schemes as well as skilful and daring each new adventure when successful became at once the incentive and furnished the means for farther speculation it seemed to be necessary to him as to an ambitious conqueror to push on from achievement to achievement without stopping to secure far less to enjoy the acquisitions which he made accustomed to see his whole fortune trembling in the scales of chance and dexterous at adopting expedients for casting the balance in his favour his health and spirits and activity seemed ever to increase with the animating hazards on which he staked his wealth and he resembled a sailor accustomed to brave the billows and the foe whose confidence rises on the eve of tempest or of battle he was not however insensible to the changes which increasing age or supervening malady might make in his own constitution and was anxious in good time to secure in me an assistant who might take the helm when his hand grew weary and keep the vessels way according to his counsel and instruction paternal affection as well as the furtherance of his own plans determined him to the same conclusion your father though his fortune was vested in the house was only a sleeping partner as the commercial phrase goes and owen whose probity and skill in the details of arithmetic rendered his services invaluable as a head clerk was not possessed either of information or talents sufficient to conduct the mysteries of the principal management if my father were suddenly summoned from life what would become of the world of schemes which he had formed unless his son were moulded into a commercial hercules fit to sustain the weight when relinquished by the falling atlas and what would become of that son himself if a stranger to business of this description he found himself at once involved in the labyrinth of mercantile concerns without the clew of knowledge necessary for his extraction for all these reasons avowed and secret my father was determined i should embrace his profession and when he was determined the resolution of no man was more immovable i however was also a party to be consulted and with something of his own pertinacity i had formed a determination precisely contrary it may i hope be some palliative for the resistance which on this occasion i offered to my fathers wishes that i did not fully understand upon what they were founded or how deeply his happiness was involved in them imagining myself certain of a large succession in future and ample maintenance in the meanwhile it never occurred to me that it might be necessary in order to secure these blessings to submit to labour and limitations unpleasant to my taste and temper i only saw in my fathers proposal for my engaging in business a desire that i should add to those heaps of wealth which he had himself acquired and imagining myself the best judge of the path to my own happiness i did not conceive that i should increase that happiness by augmenting a fortune which i believed was already sufficient and more than sufficient for every use comfort and elegant enjoyment accordingly i am compelled to repeat that my time at bourdeaux had not been spent as my father had proposed to himself what he considered as the chief end of my residence in that city i had postponed for every other and would had i dared have neglected altogether dubourg a favoured and benefited correspondent of our mercantile house was too much of a shrewd politician to make such reports to the head of the firm concerning his only child as would excite the displeasure of both and he might also as you will presently hear have views of selfish advantage in suffering me to neglect the purposes for which i was placed under his charge my conduct was regulated by the bounds of decency and good order and thus far he had no evil report to make supposing him so disposed but perhaps the crafty frenchman would have been equally complaisant had i been in the habit of indulging worse feelings than those of indolence and aversion to mercantile business as it was while i gave a decent portion of my time to the commercial studies he recommended he was by no means envious of the hours which i dedicated to other and more classical attainments nor did he ever find fault with me for dwelling upon corneille and boileau in preference to postlethwayte supposing his folio to have then existed and monsieur dubourg able to have pronounced his name or savary or any other writer on commercial economy he had picked up somewhere a convenient expression with which he rounded off every letter to his correspondent i was all he said that a father could wish my father never quarrelled with a phrase however frequently repeated provided it seemed to him distinct and expressive and addison himself could not have found expressions so satisfactory to him as yours received and duly honoured the bills enclosed as per margin knowing therefore very well what he desired me to be mr osbaldistone made no doubt from the frequent repetition of dubourgs favourite phrase that i was the very thing he wished to see me when in an evil hour he received my letter containing my eloquent and detailed apology for declining a place in the firm and a desk and stool in the corner of the dark countinghouse in crane alley surmounting in height those of owen and the other clerks and only inferior to the tripod of my father himself all was wrong from that moment dubourgs reports became as suspicious as if his bills had been noted for dishonour i was summoned home in all haste and received in the manner i have already communicated to you chapter second i begin shrewdly to suspect the young man of a terrible taint poetry with which idle disease if he be infected theres no hope of him in astate course actum est of him for a commonwealths man if he gotot in rhyme once ben jonsons bartholomew fair my father had generally speaking his temper under complete selfcommand and his anger rarely indicated itself by words except in a sort of dry testy manner to those who had displeased him he never used threats or expressions of loud resentment all was arranged with him on system and it was his practice to do the needful on every occasion without wasting words about it it was therefore with a bitter smile that he listened to my imperfect answers concerning the state of commerce in france and unmercifully permitted me to involve myself deeper and deeper in the mysteries of agio tariffs tare and tret nor can i charge my memory with his having looked positively angry until he found me unable to explain the exact effect which the depreciation of the louis dor had produced on the negotiation of bills of exchange the most remarkable national occurrence in my time said my father who nevertheless had seen the revolution and he knows no more of it than a post on the quay mr francis suggested owen in his timid and conciliatory manner cannot have forgotten that by an arret of the king of france dated st may it was provided that the porteur within ten days after due must make demand mr francis said my father interrupting him will i dare say recollect for the moment anything you are so kind as hint to him but body o me how dubourg could permit him hark ye owen what sort of a youth is clement dubourg his nephew there in the office the blackhaired lad one of the cleverest clerks sir in the house a prodigious young man for his time answered owen for the gaiety and civility of the young frenchman had won his heart ay ay i suppose he knows something of the nature of exchange dubourg was determined i should have one youngster at least about my hand who understood business but i see his drift and he shall find that i do so when he looks at the balancesheet owen let clements salary be paid up to next quarterday and let him ship himself back to bourdeaux in his fathers ship which is clearing out yonder dismiss clement dubourg sir said owen with a faltering voice yes sir dismiss him instantly it is enough to have a stupid englishman in the countinghouse to make blunders without keeping a sharp frenchman there to profit by them i had lived long enough in the territories of the grand monarque to contract a hearty aversion to arbitrary exertion of authority even if it had not been instilled into me with my earliest breeding and i could not refrain from interposing to prevent an innocent and meritorious young man from paying the penalty of having acquired that proficiency which my father had desired for me i beg pardon sir when mr osbaldistone had done speaking but i think it but just that if i have been negligent of my studies i should pay the forfeit myself i have no reason to charge monsieur dubourg with having neglected to give me opportunities of improvement however little i may have profited by them and with respect to monsieur clement dubourg with respect to him and to you i shall take the measures which i see needful replied my father but it is fair in you frank to take your own blame on your own shoulders very fair that cannot be denied i cannot acquit old dubourg he said looking to owen for having merely afforded frank the means of useful knowledge without either seeing that he took advantage of them or reporting to me if he did not you see owen he has natural notions of equity becoming a british merchant mr francis said the headclerk with his usual formal inclination of the head and a slight elevation of his right hand which he had acquired by a habit of sticking his pen behind his ear before he spoke mr francis seems to understand the fundamental principle of all moral accounting the great ethic rule of three let a do to b as he would have b do to him the product will give the rule of conduct required my father smiled at this reduction of the golden rule to arithmetical form but instantly proceeded all this signifies nothing frank you have been throwing away your time like a boy and in future you must learn to live like a man i shall put you under owens care for a few months to recover the lost ground i was about to reply but owen looked at me with such a supplicatory and warning gesture that i was involuntarily silent we will then continued my father resume the subject of mine of the st ultimo to which you sent me an answer which was unadvised and unsatisfactory so now fill your glass and push the bottle to owen want of courage of audacity if you will was never my failing i answered firmly i was sorry that my letter was unsatisfactory unadvised it was not for i had given the proposal his goodness had made me my instant and anxious attention and it was with no small pain that i found myself obliged to decline it my father bent his keen eye for a moment on me and instantly withdrew it as he made no answer i thought myself obliged to proceed though with some hesitation and he only interrupted me by monosyllables it is impossible sir for me to have higher respect for any character than i have for the commercial even were it not yours indeed it connects nation with nation relieves the wants and contributes to the wealth of all and is to the general commonwealth of the civilised world what the daily intercourse of ordinary life is to private society or rather what air and food are to our bodies well sir and yet sir i find myself compelled to persist in declining to adopt a character which i am so ill qualified to support i will take care that you acquire the qualifications necessary you are no longer the guest and pupil of dubourg but my dear sir it is no defect of teaching which i plead but my own inability to profit by instruction nonsense have you kept your journal in the terms i desired yes sir be pleased to bring it here the volume thus required was a sort of commonplace book kept by my fathers recommendation in which i had been directed to enter notes of the miscellaneous information which i had acquired in the course of my studies foreseeing that he would demand inspection of this record i had been attentive to transcribe such particulars of information as he would most likely be pleased with but too often the pen had discharged the task without much correspondence with the head and it had also happened that the book being the receptacle nearest to my hand i had occasionally jotted down memoranda which had little regard to traffic i now put it into my fathers hand devoutly hoping he might light on nothing that would increase his displeasure against me owens face which had looked something blank when the question was put cleared up at my ready answer and wore a smile of hope when i brought from my apartment and placed before my father a commerciallooking volume rather broader than it was long having brazen clasps and a binding of rough calf this looked businesslike and was encouraging to my benevolent wellwisher but he actually smiled with pleasure as he heard my father run over some part of the contents muttering his critical remarks as he went on brandies barils and barricants also tonneaux at nantz velles to the barique at cognac and rochelle at bourdeaux very right frank duties on tonnage and customhouse see saxbys tables thats not well you should have transcribed the passage it fixes the thing in the memory reports outward and inward corn debentures oversea cockets linens isingham gentish stockfish titling cropling lubfish you should have noted that they are all nevertheless to be entered as titlings how many inches long is a titling owen seeing me at fault hazarded a whisper of which i fortunately caught the import eighteen inches sir and a lubfish is twentyfour very right it is important to remember this on account of the portuguese trade but what have we here bourdeaux founded in the year castle of the trompette palace of gallienus well well thats very right too this is a kind of wastebook owen in which all the transactions of the day emptions orders payments receipts acceptances draughts commissions and advices are entered miscellaneously that they may be regularly transferred to the daybook and ledger answered owen i am glad mr francis is so methodical i perceived myself getting so fast into favour that i began to fear the consequence would be my fathers more obstinate perseverance in his resolution that i must become a merchant and as i was determined on the contrary i began to wish i had not to use my friend mr owens phrase been so methodical but i had no reason for apprehension on that score for a blotted piece of paper dropped out of the book and being taken up by my father he interrupted a hint from owen on the propriety of securing loose memoranda with a little paste by exclaiming to the memory of edward the black prince whats all this verses by heaven frank you are a greater blockhead than i supposed you my father you must recollect as a man of business looked upon the labour of poets with contempt and as a religious man and of the dissenting persuasion he considered all such pursuits as equally trivial and profane before you condemn him you must recall to remembrance how too many of the poets in the end of the seventeenth century had led their lives and employed their talents the sect also to which my father belonged felt or perhaps affected a puritanical aversion to the lighter exertions of literature so that many causes contributed to augment the unpleasant surprise occasioned by the illtimed discovery of this unfortunate copy of verses as for poor owen could the bobwig which he then wore have uncurled itself and stood on end with horror i am convinced the mornings labour of the friseur would have been undone merely by the excess of his astonishment at this enormity an inroad on the strongbox or an erasure in the ledger or a missummation in a fitted account could hardly have surprised him more disagreeably my father read the lines sometimes with an affectation of not being able to understand the sense sometimes in a mouthing tone of mock heroic always with an emphasis of the most bitter irony most irritating to the nerves of an author o for the voice of that wild horn on fontarabian echoes borne the dying heros call that told imperial charlemagne how paynim sons of swarthy spain had wrought his champions fall fontarabian echoes continued my father interrupting himself the fontarabian fair would have been more to the purpose paynim whats paynim could you not say pagan as well and write english at least if you must needs write nonsense sad over earth and ocean sounding and englands distant cliffs astounding such are the notes should say how britains hope and frances fear victor of cressy and poitier in bordeaux dying lay poitiers by the way is always spelt with an s and i know no reason why orthography should give place to rhyme raise my faint head my squires he said and let the casement be displayd that i may see once more the splendour of the setting sun gleam on thy mirrored wave garonne and blayes empurpled shore garonne and sun is a bad rhyme why frank you do not even understand the beggarly trade you have chosen like me he sinks to glorys sleep his fall the dews of evening steep as if in sorrow shed so soft shall fall the trickling tear when englands maids and matrons hear of their black edward dead and though my sun of glory set nor france nor england shall forget the terror of my name and oft shall britains heroes rise new planets in these southern skies through clouds of blood and flame a cloud of flame is something new goodmorrow my masters all and a merry christmas to you why the bellman writes better lines he then tossed the paper from him with an air of superlative contempt and concluded upon my credit frank you are a greater blockhead than i took you for what could i say my dear tresham there i stood swelling with indignant mortification while my father regarded me with a calm but stern look of scorn and pity and poor owen with uplifted hands and eyes looked as striking a picture of horror as if he had just read his patrons name in the gazette at length i took courage to speak endeavouring that my tone of voice should betray my feelings as little as possible i am quite aware sir how ill qualified i am to play the conspicuous part in society you have destined for me and luckily i am not ambitious of the wealth i might acquire mr owen would be a much more effective assistant i said this in some malice for i considered owen as having deserted my cause a little too soon owen said my father the boy is mad actually insane and pray sir if i may presume to inquire having coolly turned me over to mr owen although i may expect more attention from any one than from my son what may your own sage projects be i should wish sir i replied summoning up my courage to travel for two or three years should that consist with your pleasure otherwise although late i would willingly spend the same time at oxford or cambridge in the name of common sense was the like ever heard to put yourself to school among pedants and jacobites when you might be pushing your fortune in the world why not go to westminster or eton at once man and take to lillys grammar and accidence and to the birch too if you like it then sir if you think my plan of improvement too late i would willingly return to the continent you have already spent too much time there to little purpose mr francis then i would choose the army sir in preference to any other active line of life choose the d l answered my father hastily and then checking himself i profess you make me as great a fool as you are yourself is he not enough to drive one mad owen poor owen shook his head and looked down hark ye frank continued my father i will cut all this matter very short i was at your age when my father turned me out of doors and settled my legal inheritance on my younger brother i left osbaldistone hall on the back of a brokendown hunter with ten guineas in my purse i have never crossed the threshold again and i never will i know not and i care not if my foxhunting brother is alive or has broken his neck but he has children frank and one of them shall be my son if you cross me farther in this matter you will do your pleasure i answered rather i fear with more sullen indifference than respect with what is your own yes frank what i have is my own if labour in getting and care in augmenting can make a right of property and no drone shall feed on my honeycomb think on it well what i have said is not without reflection and what i resolve upon i will execute honoured sir dear sir exclaimed owen tears rushing into his eyes you are not wont to be in such a hurry in transacting business of importance let mr francis run up the balance before you shut the account he loves you i am sure and when he puts down his filial obedience to the per contra i am sure his objections will disappear do you think i will ask him twice said my father sternly to be my friend my assistant and my confidant to be a partner of my cares and of my fortune owen i thought you had known me better he looked at me as if he meant to add something more but turned instantly away and left the room abruptly i was i own affected by this view of the case which had not occurred to me and my father would probably have had little reason to complain of me had he commenced the discussion with this argument but it was too late i had much of his own obduracy of resolution and heaven had decreed that my sin should be my punishment though not to the extent which my transgression merited owen when we were left alone continued to look at me with eyes which tears from time to time moistened as if to discover before attempting the task of intercessor upon what point my obstinacy was most assailable at length he began with broken and disconcerted accents o l d mr francis good heavens sir my stars mr osbaldistone that i should ever have seen this day and you so young a gentleman sir for the love of heaven look at both sides of the account think what you are going to lose a noble fortune sir one of the finest houses in the city even under the old firm of tresham and trent and now osbaldistone and tresham you might roll in gold mr francis and my dear young mr frank if there was any particular thing in the business of the house which you disliked i would sinking his voice to a whisper put it in order for you termly or weekly or daily if you will do my dear mr francis think of the honour due to your father that your days may be long in the land i am much obliged to you mr owen said i very much obliged indeed but my father is best judge how to bestow his money he talks of one of my cousins let him dispose of his wealth as he pleases i will never sell my liberty for gold gold sir i wish you saw the balancesheet of profits at last term it was in five figures five figures to each partners sum total mr frank and all this is to go to a papist and a northcountry booby and a disaffected person besides it will break my heart mr francis that have been toiling more like a dog than a man and all for love of the firm think how it will sound osbaldistone tresham and osbaldistone or perhaps who knows again lowering his voice osbaldistone osbaldistone and tresham for our mr osbaldistone can buy them all out but mr owen my cousins name being also osbaldistone the name of the company will sound every bit as well in your ears o fie upon you mr francis when you know how well i love you your cousin indeed a papist no doubt like his father and a disaffected person to the protestant succession thats another item doubtless there are many very good men catholics mr owen rejoined i as owen was about to answer with unusual animation my father reentered the apartment you were right he said owen and i was wrong we will take more time to think over this matter young man you will prepare to give me an answer on this important subject this day month i bowed in silence sufficiently glad of a reprieve and trusting it might indicate some relaxation in my fathers determination the time of probation passed slowly unmarked by any accident whatever i went and came and disposed of my time as i pleased without question or criticism on the part of my father indeed i rarely saw him save at mealtimes when he studiously avoided a discussion which you may well suppose i was in no hurry to press onward our conversation was of the news of the day or on such general topics as strangers discourse upon to each other nor could any one have guessed from its tenor that there remained undecided betwixt us a dispute of such importance it haunted me however more than once like the nightmare was it possible he would keep his word and disinherit his only son in favour of a nephew whose very existence he was not perhaps quite certain of my grandfathers conduct in similar circumstances boded me no good had i considered the matter rightly but i had formed an erroneous idea of my fathers character from the importance which i recollected i maintained with him and his whole family before i went to france i was not aware that there are men who indulge their children at an early age because to do so interests and amuses them and who can yet be sufficiently severe when the same children cross their expectations at a more advanced period on the contrary i persuaded myself that all i had to apprehend was some temporary alienation of affection perhaps a rustication of a few weeks which i thought would rather please me than otherwise since it would give me an opportunity of setting about my unfinished version of orlando furioso a poem which i longed to render into english verse i suffered this belief to get such absolute possession of my mind that i had resumed my blotted papers and was busy in meditation on the oftrecurring rhymes of the spenserian stanza when i heard a low and cautious tap at the door of my apartment come in i said and mr owen entered so regular were the motions and habits of this worthy man that in all probability this was the first time he had ever been in the second story of his patrons house however conversant with the first and i am still at a loss to know in what manner he discovered my apartment mr francis he said interrupting my expression of surprise and pleasure at seeing him i do not know if i am doing well in what i am about to say it is not right to speak of what passes in the comptinghouse out of doors one should not tell as they say to the post in the warehouse how many lines there are in the ledger but young twineall has been absent from the house for a fortnight and more until two days since very well my dear sir and how does that concern us stay mr francis your father gave him a private commission and i am sure he did not go down to falmouth about the pilchard affair and the exeter business with blackwell and company has been settled and the mining people in cornwall trevanion and treguilliam have paid all they are likely to pay and any other matter of business must have been put through my books in short its my faithful belief that twineall has been down in the north do you really suppose so said i somewhat startled he has spoken about nothing sir since he returned but his new boots and his ripon spurs and a cockfight at york its as true as the multiplicationtable do heaven bless you my dear child make up your mind to please your father and to be a man and a merchant at once i felt at that instant a strong inclination to submit and to make owen happy by requesting him to tell my father that i resigned myself to his disposal but pride pride the source of so much that is good and so much that is evil in our course of life prevented me my acquiescence stuck in my throat and while i was coughing to get it up my fathers voice summoned owen he hastily left the room and the opportunity was lost my father was methodical in everything at the very same time of the day in the same apartment and with the same tone and manner which he had employed an exact month before he recapitulated the proposal he had made for taking me into partnership and assigning me a department in the countinghouse and requested to have my final decision i thought at the time there was something unkind in this and i still think that my fathers conduct was injudicious a more conciliatory treatment would in all probability have gained his purpose as it was i stood fast and as respectfully as i could declined the proposal he made to me perhaps for who can judge of their own heart i felt it unmanly to yield on the first summons and expected farther solicitation as at least a pretext for changing my mind if so i was disappointed for my father turned coolly to owen and only said you see it is as i told you well frank addressing me you are nearly of age and as well qualified to judge of what will constitute your own happiness as you ever are like to be therefore i say no more but as i am not bound to give in to your plans any more than you are compelled to submit to mine may i ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my assistance i answered not a little abashed that being bred to no profession and having no funds of my own it was obviously impossible for me to subsist without some allowance from my father that my wishes were very moderate and that i hoped my aversion for the profession to which he had designed me would not occasion his altogether withdrawing his paternal support and protection that is to say you wish to lean on my arm and yet to walk your own way that can hardly be frank however i suppose you mean to obey my directions so far as they do not cross your own humour i was about to speak silence if you please he continued supposing this to be the case you will instantly set out for the north of england to pay your uncle a visit and see the state of his family i have chosen from among his sons he has six i believe one who i understand is most worthy to fill the place i intended for you in the countinghouse but some farther arrangements may be necessary and for these your presence may be requisite you shall have farther instructions at osbaldistone hall where you will please to remain until you hear from me everything will be ready for your departure tomorrow morning with these words my father left the apartment what does all this mean mr owen said i to my sympathetic friend whose countenance wore a cast of the deepest dejection you have ruined yourself mr frank thats all when your father talks in that quiet determined manner there will be no more change in him than in a fitted account and so it proved for the next morning at five oclock i found myself on the road to york mounted on a reasonably good horse and with fifty guineas in my pocket travelling as it would seem for the purpose of assisting in the adoption of a successor to myself in my fathers house and favour and for aught i knew eventually in his fortune also chapter third the slack sail shifts from side to side the boat untrimmd admits the tide borne down adrift at random tost the oar breaks short the rudders lost gays fables i have tagged with rhyme and blank verse the subdivisions of this important narrative in order to seduce your continued attention by powers of composition of stronger attraction than my own the preceding lines refer to an unfortunate navigator who daringly unloosed from its moorings a boat which he was unable to manage and thrust it off into the full tide of a navigable river no schoolboy who betwixt frolic and defiance has executed a similar rash attempt could feel himself when adrift in a strong current in a situation more awkward than mine when i found myself driving without a compass on the ocean of human life there had been such unexpected ease in the manner in which my father slipt a knot usually esteemed the strongest which binds society together and suffered me to depart as a sort of outcast from his family that it strangely lessened the confidence in my own personal accomplishments which had hitherto sustained me prince prettyman now a prince and now a fishers son had not a more awkward sense of his degradation we are so apt in our engrossing egotism to consider all those accessories which are drawn around us by prosperity as pertaining and belonging to our own persons that the discovery of our unimportance when left to our own proper resources becomes inexpressibly mortifying as the hum of london died away on my ear the distant peal of her steeples more than once sounded to my ears the admonitory turn again erst heard by her future lord mayor and when i looked back from highgate on her dusky magnificence i felt as if i were leaving behind me comfort opulence the charms of society and all the pleasures of cultivated life but the die was cast it was indeed by no means probable that a late and ungracious compliance with my fathers wishes would have reinstated me in the situation which i had lost on the contrary firm and strong of purpose as he himself was he might rather have been disgusted than conciliated by my tardy and compulsory acquiescence in his desire that i should engage in commerce my constitutional obstinacy came also to my aid and pride whispered how poor a figure i should make when an airing of four miles from london had blown away resolutions formed during a months serious deliberation hope too that never forsakes the young and hardy lent her lustre to my future prospects my father could not be serious in the sentence of forisfamiliation which he had so unhesitatingly pronounced it must be but a trial of my disposition which endured with patience and steadiness on my part would raise me in his estimation and lead to an amicable accommodation of the point in dispute between us i even settled in my own mind how far i would concede to him and on what articles of our supposed treaty i would make a firm stand and the result was according to my computation that i was to be reinstated in my full rights of filiation paying the easy penalty of some ostensible compliances to atone for my past rebellion in the meanwhile i was lord of my person and experienced that feeling of independence which the youthful bosom receives with a thrilling mixture of pleasure and apprehension my purse though by no means amply replenished was in a situation to supply all the wants and wishes of a traveller i had been accustomed while at bourdeaux to act as my own valet my horse was fresh young and active and the buoyancy of my spirits soon surmounted the melancholy reflections with which my journey commenced i should have been glad to have journeyed upon a line of road better calculated to afford reasonable objects of curiosity or a more interesting country to the traveller but the north road was then and perhaps still is singularly deficient in these respects nor do i believe you can travel so far through britain in any other direction without meeting more of what is worthy to engage the attention my mental ruminations notwithstanding my assumed confidence were not always of an unchequered nature the muse too the very coquette who had led me into this wilderness like others of her sex deserted me in my utmost need and i should have been reduced to rather an uncomfortable state of dulness had it not been for the occasional conversation of strangers who chanced to pass the same way but the characters whom i met with were of a uniform and uninteresting description country parsons jogging homewards after a visitation farmers or graziers returning from a distant market clerks of traders travelling to collect what was due to their masters in provincial towns with now and then an officer going down into the country upon the recruiting service were at this period the persons by whom the turnpikes and tapsters were kept in exercise our speech therefore was of tithes and creeds of beeves and grain of commodities wet and dry and the solvency of the retail dealers occasionally varied by the description of a siege or battle in flanders which perhaps the narrator only gave me at second hand robbers a fertile and alarming theme filled up every vacancy and the names of the golden farmer the flying highwayman jack needham and other beggars opera heroes were familiar in our mouths as household words at such tales like children closing their circle round the fire when the ghost story draws to its climax the riders drew near to each other looked before and behind them examined the priming of their pistols and vowed to stand by each other in case of danger an engagement which like other offensive and defensive alliances sometimes glided out of remembrance when there was an appearance of actual peril of all the fellows whom i ever saw haunted by terrors of this nature one poor man with whom i travelled a day and a half afforded me most amusement he had upon his pillion a very small but apparently a very weighty portmanteau about the safety of which he seemed particularly solicitous never trusting it out of his own immediate care and uniformly repressing the officious zeal of the waiters and ostlers who offered their services to carry it into the house with the same precaution he laboured to conceal not only the purpose of his journey and his ultimate place of destination but even the direction of each days route nothing embarrassed him more than to be asked by any one whether he was travelling upwards or downwards or at what stage he intended to bait his place of rest for the night he scrutinised with the most anxious care alike avoiding solitude and what he considered as bad neighbourhood and at grantham i believe he sate up all night to avoid sleeping in the next room to a thickset squinting fellow in a black wig and a tarnished goldlaced waistcoat with all these cares on his mind my fellow traveller to judge by his thews and sinews was a man who might have set danger at defiance with as much impunity as most men he was strong and well built and judging from his goldlaced hat and cockade seemed to have served in the army or at least to belong to the military profession in one capacity or other his conversation also though always sufficiently vulgar was that of a man of sense when the terrible bugbears which haunted his imagination for a moment ceased to occupy his attention but every accidental association recalled them an open heath a close plantation were alike subjects of apprehension and the whistle of a shepherd lad was instantly converted into the signal of a depredator even the sight of a gibbet if it assured him that one robber was safely disposed of by justice never failed to remind him how many remained still unhanged i should have wearied of this fellows company had i not been still more tired of my own thoughts some of the marvellous stories however which he related had in themselves a cast of interest and another whimsical point of his peculiarities afforded me the occasional opportunity of amusing myself at his expense among his tales several of the unfortunate travellers who fell among thieves incurred that calamity from associating themselves on the road with a welldressed and entertaining stranger in whose company they trusted to find protection as well as amusement who cheered their journey with tale and song protected them against the evils of overcharges and false reckonings until at length under pretext of showing a near path over a desolate common he seduced his unsuspicious victims from the public road into some dismal glen where suddenly blowing his whistle he assembled his comrades from their lurkingplace and displayed himself in his true colours the captain namely of the band of robbers to whom his unwary fellowtravellers had forfeited their purses and perhaps their lives towards the conclusion of such a tale and when my companion had wrought himself into a fever of apprehension by the progress of his own narrative i observed that he usually eyed me with a glance of doubt and suspicion as if the possibility occurred to him that he might at that very moment be in company with a character as dangerous as that which his tale described and ever and anon when such suggestions pressed themselves on the mind of this ingenious selftormentor he drew off from me to the opposite side of the highroad looked before behind and around him examined his arms and seemed to prepare himself for flight or defence as circumstances might require the suspicion implied on such occasions seemed to me only momentary and too ludicrous to be offensive there was in fact no particular reflection on my dress or address although i was thus mistaken for a robber a man in those days might have all the external appearance of a gentleman and yet turn out to be a highwayman for the division of labour in every department not having then taken place so fully as since that period the profession of the polite and accomplished adventurer who nicked you out of your money at whites or bowled you out of it at marylebone was often united with that of the professed ruffian who on bagshot heath or finchley common commanded his brother beau to stand and deliver there was also a touch of coarseness and hardness about the manners of the times which has since in a great degree been softened and shaded away it seems to me on recollection as if desperate men had less reluctance then than now to embrace the most desperate means of retrieving their fortune the times were indeed past when anthonyawood mourned over the execution of two men goodly in person and of undisputed courage and honour who were hanged without mercy at oxford merely because their distress had driven them to raise contributions on the highway we were still farther removed from the days of the mad prince and poins and yet from the number of unenclosed and extensive heaths in the vicinity of the metropolis and from the less populous state of remote districts both were frequented by that species of mounted highwaymen that may possibly become one day unknown who carried on their trade with something like courtesy and like gibbet in the beaux stratagem piqued themselves on being the best behaved men on the road and on conducting themselves with all appropriate civility in the exercise of their vocation a young man therefore in my circumstances was not entitled to be highly indignant at the mistake which confounded him with this worshipful class of depredators neither was i offended on the contrary i found amusement in alternately exciting and lulling to sleep the suspicions of my timorous companion and in purposely so acting as still farther to puzzle a brain which nature and apprehension had combined to render none of the clearest when my free conversation had lulled him into complete security it required only a passing inquiry concerning the direction of his journey or the nature of the business which occasioned it to put his suspicions once more in arms for example a conversation on the comparative strength and activity of our horses took such a turn as follows o sir said my companion for the gallop i grant you but allow me to say your horse although he is a very handsome gelding that must be owned has too little bone to be a good roadster the trot sir striking his bucephalus with his spurs the trot is the true pace for a hackney and were we near a town i should like to try that daisycutter of yours upon a piece of level road barring canter for a quart of claret at the next inn content sir replied i and here is a stretch of ground very favourable hem ahem answered my friend with hesitation i make it a rule of travelling never to blow my horse between stages one never knows what occasion he may have to put him to his mettle and besides sir when i said i would match you i meant with even weight you ride four stone lighter than i very well but i am content to carry weight pray what may that portmanteau of yours weigh my ppportmanteau replied he hesitating o very little a feather just a few shirts and stockings i should think it heavier from its appearance ill hold you the quart of claret it makes the odds betwixt our weight youre mistaken sir i assure you quite mistaken replied my friend edging off to the side of the road as was his wont on these alarming occasions well i am willing to venture the wine or i will bet you ten pieces to five that i carry your portmanteau on my croupe and outtrot you into the bargain this proposal raised my friends alarm to the uttermost his nose changed from the natural copper hue which it had acquired from many a comfortable cup of claret or sack into a palish brassy tint and his teeth chattered with apprehension at the unveiled audacity of my proposal which seemed to place the barefaced plunderer before him in full atrocity as he faltered for an answer i relieved him in some degree by a question concerning a steeple which now became visible and an observation that we were now so near the village as to run no risk from interruption on the road at this his countenance cleared up but i easily perceived that it was long ere he forgot a proposal which seemed to him so fraught with suspicion as that which i had now hazarded i trouble you with this detail of the mans disposition and the manner in which i practised upon it because however trivial in themselves these particulars were attended by an important influence on future incidents which will occur in this narrative at the time this persons conduct only inspired me with contempt and confirmed me in an opinion which i already entertained that of all the propensities which teach mankind to torment themselves that of causeless fear is the most irritating busy painful and pitiable chapter fourth the scots are poor cries surly english pride true is the charge nor by themselves denied are they not then in strictest reason clear who wisely come to mend their fortunes here churchill there was in the days of which i write an oldfashioned custom on the english road which i suspect is now obsolete or practised only by the vulgar journeys of length being made on horseback and of course by brief stages it was usual always to make a halt on the sunday in some town where the traveller might attend divine service and his horse have the benefit of the day of rest the institution of which is as humane to our brute labourers as profitable to ourselves a counterpart to this decent practice and a remnant of old english hospitality was that the landlord of a principal inn laid aside his character of a publican on the seventh day and invited the guests who chanced to be within his walls to take a part of his family beef and pudding this invitation was usually complied with by all whose distinguished rank did not induce them to think compliance a derogation and the proposal of a bottle of wine after dinner to drink the landlords health was the only recompense ever offered or accepted i was born a citizen of the world and my inclination led me into all scenes where my knowledge of mankind could be enlarged i had besides no pretensions to sequester myself on the score of superior dignity and therefore seldom failed to accept of the sundays hospitality of mine host whether of the garter lion or bear the honest publican dilated into additional consequence by a sense of his own importance while presiding among the guests on whom it was his ordinary duty to attend was in himself an entertaining spectacle and around his genial orbit other planets of inferior consequence performed their revolutions the wits and humorists the distinguished worthies of the town or village the apothecary the attorney even the curate himself did not disdain to partake of this hebdomadal festivity the guests assembled from different quarters and following different professions formed in language manners and sentiments a curious contrast to each other not indifferent to those who desired to possess a knowledge of mankind in its varieties it was on such a day and such an occasion that my timorous acquaintance and i were about to grace the board of the ruddyfaced host of the black bear in the town of darlington and bishopric of durham when our landlord informed us with a sort of apologetic tone that there was a scotch gentleman to dine with us a gentleman what sort of a gentleman said my companion somewhat hastily his mind i suppose running on gentlemen of the pad as they were then termed why a scotch sort of a gentleman as i said before returned mine host they are all gentle ye mun know though they ha narra shirt to back but this is a decentish hallion a canny north briton as eer crossd berwick bridge i trow hes a dealer in cattle let us have his company by all means answered my companion and then turning to me he gave vent to the tenor of his own reflections i respect the scotch sir i love and honour the nation for their sense of morality men talk of their filth and their poverty but commend me to sterling honesty though clad in rags as the poet saith i have been credibly assured sir by men on whom i can depend that there was never known such a thing in scotland as a highway robbery thats because they have nothing to lose said mine host with the chuckle of a selfapplauding wit no no landlord answered a strong deep voice behind him its een because your english gaugers and supervisors that you have sent down benorth the tweed have taen up the trade of thievery over the heads of the native professors the introduction of gaugers supervisors and examiners was one of the great complaints of the scottish nation though a natural consequence of the union well said mr campbell answered the landlord i did not think thoudst been sae near us mon but thou kens im an outspoken yorkshire tyke and how go markets in the south even in the ordinar replied mr campbell wise folks buy and sell and fools are bought and sold but wise men and fools both eat their dinner answered our jolly entertainer and here a comes as prime a buttock of beef as eer hungry men stuck fork in so saying he eagerly whetted his knife assumed his seat of empire at the head of the board and loaded the plates of his sundry guests with his good cheer this was the first time i had heard the scottish accent or indeed that i had familiarly met with an individual of the ancient nation by whom it was spoken yet from an early period they had occupied and interested my imagination my father as is well known to you was of an ancient family in northumberland from whose seat i was while eating the aforesaid dinner not very many miles distant the quarrel betwixt him and his relatives was such that he scarcely ever mentioned the race from which he sprung and held as the most contemptible species of vanity the weakness which is commonly termed family pride his ambition was only to be distinguished as william osbaldistone the first at least one of the first merchants on change and to have proved him the lineal representative of william the conqueror would have far less flattered his vanity than the hum and bustle which his approach was wont to produce among the bulls bears and brokers of stockalley he wished no doubt that i should remain in such ignorance of my relatives and descent as might insure a correspondence between my feelings and his own on this subject but his designs as will happen occasionally to the wisest were in some degree at least counteracted by a being whom his pride would never have supposed of importance adequate to influence them in any way his nurse an old northumbrian woman attached to him from his infancy was the only person connected with his native province for whom he retained any regard and when fortune dawned upon him one of the first uses which he made of her favours was to give mabel rickets a place of residence within his household after the death of my mother the care of nursing me during my childish illnesses and of rendering all those tender attentions which infancy exacts from female affection devolved on old mabel interdicted by her master from speaking to him on the subject of the heaths glades and dales of her beloved northumberland she poured herself forth to my infant ear in descriptions of the scenes of her youth and long narratives of the events which tradition declared to have passed amongst them to these i inclined my ear much more seriously than to graver but less animated instructors even yet methinks i see old mabel her head slightly agitated by the palsy of age and shaded by a close cap as white as the driven snow her face wrinkled but still retaining the healthy tinge which it had acquired in rural labour i think i see her look around on the brick walls and narrow street which presented themselves before our windows as she concluded with a sigh the favourite old ditty which i then preferred and why should i not tell the truth which i still prefer to all the opera airs ever minted by the capricious brain of an italian mus d oh the oak the ash and the bonny ivy tree they flourish best at home in the north countrie now in the legends of mabel the scottish nation was ever freshly remembered with all the embittered declamation of which the narrator was capable the inhabitants of the opposite frontier served in her narratives to fill up the parts which ogres and giants with sevenleagued boots occupy in the ordinary nursery tales and how could it be otherwise was it not the black douglas who slew with his own hand the heir of the osbaldistone family the day after he took possession of his estate surprising him and his vassals while solemnizing a feast suited to the occasion was it not wat the devil who drove all the yearold hogs off the braes of lanthornside in the very recent days of my grandfathers father and had we not many a trophy but according to old mabels version of history far more honourably gained to mark our revenge of these wrongs did not sir henry osbaldistone fifth baron of the name carry off the fair maid of fairnington as achilles did his chryseis and briseis of old and detain her in his fortress against all the power of her friends supported by the most mighty scottish chiefs of warlike fame and had not our swords shone foremost at most of those fields in which england was victorious over her rival all our family renown was acquired all our family misfortunes were occasioned by the northern wars warmed by such tales i looked upon the scottish people during my childhood as a race hostile by nature to the more southern inhabitants of this realm and this view of the matter was not much corrected by the language which my father sometimes held with respect to them he had engaged in some large speculations concerning oakwoods the property of highland proprietors and alleged that he found them much more ready to make bargains and extort earnest of the purchasemoney than punctual in complying on their side with the terms of the engagements the scottish mercantile men whom he was under the necessity of employing as a sort of middlemen on these occasions were also suspected by my father of having secured by one means or other more than their own share of the profit which ought to have accrued in short if mabel complained of the scottish arms in ancient times mr osbaldistone inveighed no less against the arts of these modern sinons and between them though without any fixed purpose of doing so they impressed my youthful mind with a sincere aversion to the northern inhabitants of britain as a people bloodthirsty in time of war treacherous during truce interested selfish avaricious and tricky in the business of peaceful life and having few good qualities unless there should be accounted such a ferocity which resembled courage in martial affairs and a sort of wily craft which supplied the place of wisdom in the ordinary commerce of mankind in justification or apology for those who entertained such prejudices i must remark that the scotch of that period were guilty of similar injustice to the english whom they branded universally as a race of purseproud arrogant epicures such seeds of national dislike remained between the two countries the natural consequences of their existence as separate and rival states we have seen recently the breath of a demagogue blow these sparks into a temporary flame which i sincerely hope is now extinguished in its own ashes this seems to have been written about the time of wilkes and liberty it was then with an impression of dislike that i contemplated the first scotchman i chanced to meet in society there was much about him that coincided with my previous conceptions he had the hard features and athletic form said to be peculiar to his country together with the national intonation and slow pedantic mode of expression arising from a desire to avoid peculiarities of idiom or dialect i could also observe the caution and shrewdness of his country in many of the observations which he made and the answers which he returned but i was not prepared for the air of easy selfpossession and superiority with which he seemed to predominate over the company into which he was thrown as it were by accident his dress was as coarse as it could be being still decent and at a time when great expense was lavished upon the wardrobe even of the lowest who pretended to the character of gentleman this indicated mediocrity of circumstances if not poverty his conversation intimated that he was engaged in the cattle trade no very dignified professional pursuit and yet under these disadvantages he seemed as a matter of course to treat the rest of the company with the cool and condescending politeness which implies a real or imagined superiority over those towards whom it is used when he gave his opinion on any point it was with that easy tone of confidence used by those superior to their society in rank or information as if what he said could not be doubted and was not to be questioned mine host and his sunday guests after an effort or two to support their consequence by noise and bold averment sunk gradually under the authority of mr campbell who thus fairly possessed himself of the lead in the conversation i was tempted from curiosity to dispute the ground with him myself confiding in my knowledge of the world extended as it was by my residence abroad and in the stores with which a tolerable education had possessed my mind in the latter respect he offered no competition and it was easy to see that his natural powers had never been cultivated by education but i found him much better acquainted than i was myself with the present state of france the character of the duke of orleans who had just succeeded to the regency of that kingdom and that of the statesmen by whom he was surrounded and his shrewd caustic and somewhat satirical remarks were those of a man who had been a close observer of the affairs of that country on the subject of politics campbell observed a silence and moderation which might arise from caution the divisions of whig and tory then shook england to her very centre and a powerful party engaged in the jacobite interest menaced the dynasty of hanover which had been just established on the throne every alehouse resounded with the brawls of contending politicians and as mine hosts politics were of that liberal description which quarrelled with no good customer his hebdomadal visitants were often divided in their opinion as irreconcilably as if he had feasted the common council the curate and the apothecary with a little man who made no boast of his vocation but who from the flourish and snap of his fingers i believe to have been the barber strongly espoused the cause of high church and the stuart line the exciseman as in duty bound and the attorney who looked to some petty office under the crown together with my fellowtraveller who seemed to enter keenly into the contest staunchly supported the cause of king george and the protestant succession dire was the screaming deep the oaths each party appealed to mr campbell anxious it seemed to elicit his approbation you are a scotchman sir a gentleman of your country must stand up for hereditary right cried one party you are a presbyterian assumed the other class of disputants you cannot be a friend to arbitrary power gentlemen said our scotch oracle after having gained with some difficulty a moments pause i havena much dubitation that king george weel deserves the predilection of his friends and if he can haud the grip he has gotten why doubtless he may made the gauger here a commissioner of the revenue and confer on our friend mr quitam the preferment of solicitorgeneral and he may also grant some good deed or reward to this honest gentleman who is sitting upon his portmanteau which he prefers to a chair and questionless king james is also a grateful person and when he gets his hand in play he may if he be so minded make this reverend gentleman archprelate of canterbury and dr mixit chief physician to his household and commit his royal beard to the care of my friend latherum but as i doubt mickle whether any of the competing sovereigns would give rob campbell a tass of aquavitae if he lacked it i give my vote and interest to jonathan brown our landlord to be the king and prince of skinkers conditionally that he fetches us another bottle as good as the last this sally was received with general applause in which the landlord cordially joined and when he had given orders for fulfilling the condition on which his preferment was to depend he failed not to acquaint them that for as peaceable a gentleman as mr campbell was he was moreover as bold as a lion seven highwaymen had he defeated with his single arm that beset him as he came from whitsontryste thou art deceived friend jonathan said campbell interrupting him they were but barely two and two cowardly loons as man could wish to meet withal and did you sir really said my fellowtraveller edging his chair i should have said his portmanteau nearer to mr campbell really and actually beat two highwaymen yourself alone in troth did i sir replied campbell and i think it nae great thing to make a sang about upon my word sir replied my acquaintance i should be happy to have the pleasure of your company on my journey i go northward sir this piece of gratuitous information concerning the route he proposed to himself the first i had heard my companion bestow upon any one failed to excite the corresponding confidence of the scotchman we can scarce travel together he replied drily you sir doubtless are well mounted and i for the present travel on foot or on a highland shelty that does not help me much faster forward so saying he called for a reckoning for the wine and throwing down the price of the additional bottle which he had himself introduced rose as if to take leave of us my companion made up to him and taking him by the button drew him aside into one of the windows i could not help overhearing him pressing something i supposed his company upon the journey which mr campbell seemed to decline i will pay your charges sir said the traveller in a tone as if he thought the argument should bear down all opposition it is quite impossible said campbell somewhat contemptuously i have business at rothbury but i am in no great hurry i can ride out of the way and never miss a day or so for good company upon my faith sir said campbell i cannot render you the service you seem to desiderate i am he added drawing himself up haughtily travelling on my own private affairs and if ye will act by my advisement sir ye will neither unite yourself with an absolute stranger on the road nor communicate your line of journey to those who are asking ye no questions about it he then extricated his button not very ceremoniously from the hold which detained him and coming up to me as the company were dispersing observed your friend sir is too communicative considering the nature of his trust that gentleman i replied looking towards the traveller is no friend of mine but an acquaintance whom i picked up on the road i know neither his name nor business and you seem to be deeper in his confidence than i am i only meant he replied hastily that he seems a thought rash in conferring the honour of his company on those who desire it not the gentleman replied i knows his own affairs best and i should be sorry to constitute myself a judge of them in any respect mr campbell made no farther observation but merely wished me a good journey and the party dispersed for the evening next day i parted company with my timid companion as i left the great northern road to turn more westerly in the direction of osbaldistone manor my uncles seat i cannot tell whether he felt relieved or embarrassed by my departure considering the dubious light in which he seemed to regard me for my own part his tremors ceased to amuse me and to say the truth i was heartily glad to get rid of him chapter fifth how melts my beating heart as i behold each lovely nymph our islands boast and pride push on the generous steed that sweeps along oer rough oer smooth nor heeds the steepy hill nor falters in the extended vale below the chase i approached my native north for such i esteemed it with that enthusiasm which romantic and wild scenery inspires in the lovers of nature no longer interrupted by the babble of my companion i could now remark the difference which the country exhibited from that through which i had hitherto travelled the streams now more properly deserved the name for instead of slumbering stagnant among reeds and willows they brawled along beneath the shade of natural copsewood were now hurried down declivities and now purled more leisurely but still in active motion through little lonely valleys which opening on the road from time to time seemed to invite the traveller to explore their recesses the cheviots rose before me in frowning majesty not indeed with the sublime variety of rock and cliff which characterizes mountains of the primary class but huge roundheaded and clothed with a dark robe of russet gaining by their extent and desolate appearance an influence upon the imagination as a desert district possessing a character of its own the abode of my fathers which i was now approaching was situated in a glen or narrow valley which ran up among those hills extensive estates which once belonged to the family of osbaldistone had been long dissipated by the misfortunes or misconduct of my ancestors but enough was still attached to the old mansion to give my uncle the title of a man of large property this he employed as i was given to understand by some inquiries which i made on the road in maintaining the prodigal hospitality of a northern squire of the period which he deemed essential to his family dignity from the summit of an eminence i had already had a distant view of osbaldistone hall a large and antiquated edifice peeping out from a druidical grove of huge oaks and i was directing my course towards it as straightly and as speedily as the windings of a very indifferent road would permit when my horse tired as he was pricked up his ears at the enlivening notes of a pack of hounds in full cry cheered by the occasional bursts of a french horn which in those days was a constant accompaniment to the chase i made no doubt that the pack was my uncles and drew up my horse with the purpose of suffering the hunters to pass without notice aware that a huntingfield was not the proper scene to introduce myself to a keen sportsman and determined when they had passed on to proceed to the mansionhouse at my own pace and there to await the return of the proprietor from his sport i paused therefore on a rising ground and not unmoved by the sense of interest which that species of silvan sport is so much calculated to inspire although my mind was not at the moment very accessible to impressions of this nature i expected with some eagerness the appearance of the huntsmen the fox hard run and nearly spent first made his appearance from the copse which clothed the righthand side of the valley his drooping brush his soiled appearance and jaded trot proclaimed his fate impending and the carrion crow which hovered over him already considered poor reynard as soon to be his prey he crossed the stream which divides the little valley and was dragging himself up a ravine on the other side of its wild banks when the headmost hounds followed by the rest of the pack in full cry burst from the coppice followed by the huntsman and three or four riders the dogs pursued the trace of reynard with unerring instinct and the hunters followed with reckless haste regardless of the broken and difficult nature of the ground they were tall stout young men well mounted and dressed in green and red the uniform of a sporting association formed under the auspices of old sir hildebrand osbaldistone my cousins thought i as they swept past me the next reflection was what is my reception likely to be among these worthy successors of nimrod and how improbable is it that i knowing little or nothing of rural sports shall find myself at ease or happy in my uncles family a vision that passed me interrupted these reflections it was a young lady the loveliness of whose very striking features was enhanced by the animation of the chase and the glow of the exercise mounted on a beautiful horse jet black unless where he was flecked by spots of the snowwhite foam which embossed his bridle she wore what was then somewhat unusual a coat vest and hat resembling those of a man which fashion has since called a riding habit the mode had been introduced while i was in france and was perfectly new to me her long black hair streamed on the breeze having in the hurry of the chase escaped from the ribbon which bound it some very broken ground through which she guided her horse with the most admirable address and presence of mind retarded her course and brought her closer to me than any of the other riders had passed i had therefore a full view of her uncommonly fine face and person to which an inexpressible charm was added by the wild gaiety of the scene and the romance of her singular dress and unexpected appearance as she passed me her horse made in his impetuosity an irregular movement just while coming once more upon open ground she was again putting him to his speed it served as an apology for me to ride close up to her as if to her assistance there was however no cause for alarm it was not a stumble nor a false step and if it had the fair amazon had too much selfpossession to have been deranged by it she thanked my good intentions however by a smile and i felt encouraged to put my horse to the same pace and to keep in her immediate neighbourhood the clamour of whoop dead dead and the corresponding flourish of the french horn soon announced to us that there was no more occasion for haste since the chase was at a close one of the young men whom we had seen approached us waving the brush of the fox in triumph as if to upbraid my fair companion i see she replied i see but make no noise about it if phoebe she said patting the neck of the beautiful animal on which she rode had not got among the cliffs you would have had little cause for boasting they met as she spoke and i observed them both look at me and converse a moment in an undertone the young lady apparently pressing the sportsman to do something which he declined shyly and with a sort of sheepish sullenness she instantly turned her horses head towards me saying well well thornie if you wont i must thats all sir she continued addressing me i have been endeavouring to persuade this cultivated young gentleman to make inquiry of you whether in the course of your travels in these parts you have heard anything of a friend of ours one mr francis osbaldistone who has been for some days expected at osbaldistone hall i was too happy to acknowledge myself to be the party inquired after and to express my thanks for the obliging inquiries of the young lady in that case sir she rejoined as my kinsmans politeness seems to be still slumbering you will permit me though i suppose it is highly improper to stand mistress of ceremonies and to present to you young squire thorncliff osbaldistone your cousin and die vernon who has also the honour to be your accomplished cousins poor kinswoman there was a mixture of boldness satire and simplicity in the manner in which miss vernon pronounced these words my knowledge of life was sufficient to enable me to take up a corresponding tone as i expressed my gratitude to her for her condescension and my extreme pleasure at having met with them to say the truth the compliment was so expressed that the lady might easily appropriate the greater share of it for thorncliff seemed an arrant country bumpkin awkward shy and somewhat sulky withal he shook hands with me however and then intimated his intention of leaving me that he might help the huntsman and his brothers to couple up the hounds a purpose which he rather communicated by way of information to miss vernon than as apology to me there he goes said the young lady following him with eyes in which disdain was admirably painted the prince of grooms and cockfighters and blackguard horsecoursers but there is not one of them to mend another have you read markham said miss vernon read whom maam i do not even remember the authors name o lud on what a strand are you wrecked replied the young lady a poor forlorn and ignorant stranger unacquainted with the very alcoran of the savage tribe whom you are come to reside among never to have heard of markham the most celebrated author on farriery then i fear you are equally a stranger to the more modern names of gibson and bartlett i am indeed miss vernon and do you not blush to own it said miss vernon why we must forswear your alliance then i suppose you can neither give a ball nor a mash nor a horn i confess i trust all these matters to an ostler or to my groom incredible carelessness and you cannot shoe a horse or cut his mane and tail or worm a dog or crop his ears or cut his dewclaws or reclaim a hawk or give him his castingstones or direct his diet when he is sealed or to sum up my insignificance in one word replied i i am profoundly ignorant in all these rural accomplishments then in the name of heaven mr francis osbaldistone what can you do very little to the purpose miss vernon something however i can pretend to when my groom has dressed my horse i can ride him and when my hawk is in the field i can fly him can you do this said the young lady putting her horse to a canter there was a sort of rude overgrown fence crossed the path before us with a gate composed of pieces of wood rough from the forest i was about to move forward to open it when miss vernon cleared the obstruction at a flying leap i was bound in point of honour to follow and was in a moment again at her side there are hopes of you yet she said i was afraid you had been a very degenerate osbaldistone but what on earth brings you to cubcastle for so the neighbours have christened this huntinghall of ours you might have stayed away i suppose if you would i felt i was by this time on a very intimate footing with my beautiful apparition and therefore replied in a confidential undertone indeed my dear miss vernon i might have considered it as a sacrifice to be a temporary resident in osbaldistone hall the inmates being such as you describe them but i am convinced there is one exception that will make amends for all deficiencies o you mean rashleigh said miss vernon indeed i do not i was thinking forgive me of some person much nearer me i suppose it would be proper not to understand your civility but that is not my way i dont make a courtesy for it because i am sitting on horseback but seriously i deserve your exception for i am the only conversable being about the hall except the old priest and rashleigh and who is rashleigh for heavens sake rashleigh is one who would fain have every one like him for his own sake he is sir hildebrands youngest son about your own age but not so not well looking in short but nature has given him a mouthful of common sense and the priest has added a bushelful of learning he is what we call a very clever man in this country where clever men are scarce bred to the church but in no hurry to take orders to the catholic church the catholic church what church else said the young lady but i forgot they told me you are a heretic is that true mr osbaldistone i must not deny the charge and yet you have been abroad and in catholic countries for nearly four years you have seen convents often but i have not seen much in them which recommended the catholic religion are not the inhabitants happy some are unquestionably so whom either a profound sense of devotion or an experience of the persecutions and misfortunes of the world or a natural apathy of temper has led into retirement those who have adopted a life of seclusion from sudden and overstrained enthusiasm or in hasty resentment of some disappointment or mortification are very miserable the quickness of sensation soon returns and like the wilder animals in a menagerie they are restless under confinement while others muse or fatten in cells of no larger dimensions than theirs and what continued miss vernon becomes of those victims who are condemned to a convent by the will of others what do they resemble especially what do they resemble if they are born to enjoy life and feel its blessings they are like imprisoned singingbirds replied i condemned to wear out their lives in confinement which they try to beguile by the exercise of accomplishments which would have adorned society had they been left at large i shall be returned miss vernon that is said she correcting herself i should be rather like the wild hawk who barred the free exercise of his soar through heaven will dash himself to pieces against the bars of his cage but to return to rashleigh said she in a more lively tone you will think him the pleasantest man you ever saw in your life mr osbaldistone that is for a week at least if he could find out a blind mistress never man would be so secure of conquest but the eye breaks the spell that enchants the ear but here we are in the court of the old hall which looks as wild and oldfashioned as any of its inmates there is no great toilette kept at osbaldistone hall you must know but i must take off these things they are so unpleasantly warm and the hat hurts my forehead too continued the lively girl taking it off and shaking down a profusion of sable ringlets which half laughing half blushing she separated with her white slender fingers in order to clear them away from her beautiful face and piercing hazel eyes if there was any coquetry in the action it was well disguised by the careless indifference of her manner i could not help saying that judging of the family from what i saw i should suppose the toilette a very unnecessary care thats very politely said though perhaps i ought not to understand in what sense it was meant replied miss vernon but you will see a better apology for a little negligence when you meet the orsons you are to live amongst whose forms no toilette could improve but as i said before the old dinnerbell will clang or rather clank in a few minutes it cracked of its own accord on the day of the landing of king willie and my uncle respecting its prophetic talent would never permit it to be mended so do you hold my palfrey like a duteous knight until i send some more humble squire to relieve you of the charge she threw me the rein as if we had been acquainted from our childhood jumped from her saddle tripped across the courtyard and entered at a sidedoor leaving me in admiration of her beauty and astonished with the overfrankness of her manners which seemed the more extraordinary at a time when the dictates of politeness flowing from the court of the grand monarque louis xiv prescribed to the fair sex an unusual severity of decorum i was left awkwardly enough stationed in the centre of the court of the old hall mounted on one horse and holding another in my hand the building afforded little to interest a stranger had i been disposed to consider it attentively the sides of the quadrangle were of various architecture and with their stoneshafted latticed windows projecting turrets and massive architraves resembled the inside of a convent or of one of the older and less splendid colleges of oxford i called for a domestic but was for some time totally unattended to which was the more provoking as i could perceive i was the object of curiosity to several servants both male and female from different parts of the building who popped out their heads and withdrew them like rabbits in a warren before i could make a direct appeal to the attention of any individual the return of the huntsmen and hounds relieved me from my embarrassment and with some difficulty i got one down to relieve me of the charge of the horses and another stupid boor to guide me to the presence of sir hildebrand this service he performed with much such grace and goodwill as a peasant who is compelled to act as guide to a hostile patrol and in the same manner i was obliged to guard against his deserting me in the labyrinth of low vaulted passages which conducted to stun hall as he called it where i was to be introduced to the gracious presence of my uncle we did however at length reach a long vaulted room floored with stone where a range of oaken tables of a weight and size too massive ever to be moved aside were already covered for dinner this venerable apartment which had witnessed the feasts of several generations of the osbaldistone family bore also evidence of their success in field sports huge antlers of deer which might have been trophies of the hunting of chevy chace were ranged around the walls interspersed with the stuffed skins of badgers otters martins and other animals of the chase amidst some remnants of old armour which had perhaps served against the scotch hung the more valued weapons of silvan war crossbows guns of various device and construction nets fishingrods otterspears huntingpoles with many other singular devices and engines for taking or killing game a few old pictures dimmed with smoke and stained with march beer hung on the walls representing knights and ladies honoured doubtless and renowned in their day those frowning fearfully from huge bushes of wig and of beard and these looking delightfully with all their might at the roses which they brandished in their hands i had just time to give a glance at these matters when about twelve bluecoated servants burst into the hall with much tumult and talk each rather employed in directing his comrades than in discharging his own duty some brought blocks and billets to the fire which roared blazed and ascended half in smoke half in flame up a huge tunnel with an opening wide enough to accommodate a stone seat within its ample vault and which was fronted by way of chimneypiece with a huge piece of heavy architecture where the monsters of heraldry embodied by the art of some northumbrian chisel grinned and ramped in red freestone now japanned by the smoke of centuries others of these oldfashioned servingmen bore huge smoking dishes loaded with substantial fare others brought in cups flagons bottles yea barrels of liquor all tramped kicked plunged shouldered and jostled doing as little service with as much tumult as could well be imagined at length while the dinner was after various efforts in the act of being arranged upon the board the clamour much of men and dogs the cracking of whips calculated for the intimidation of the latter voices loud and high steps which impressed by the heavyheeled boots of the period clattered like those in the statue of the festin de pierre announced the arrival of those for whose benefit the preparations were made now called don juan the hubbub among the servants rather increased than diminished as this crisis approached some called to make haste others to take time some exhorted to stand out of the way and make room for sir hildebrand and the young squires some to close round the table and be in the way some bawled to open some to shut a pair of foldingdoors which divided the hall from a sort of gallery as i afterwards learned or withdrawingroom fitted up with black wainscot opened the doors were at length and in rushed curs and men eight dogs the domestic chaplain the village doctor my six cousins and my uncle chapter sixth the rude hall rocks they come they come the din of voices shakes the dome in stalk the various forms and drest in varying morion varying vest all march with haughty step all proudly shake the crest penrose if sir hildebrand osbaldistone was in no hurry to greet his nephew of whose arrival he must have been informed for some time he had important avocations to allege in excuse had seen thee sooner lad he exclaimed after a rough shake of the hand and a hearty welcome to osbaldistone hall but had to see the hounds kennelled first thou art welcome to the hall lad here is thy cousin percie thy cousin thornie and thy cousin john your cousin dick your cousin wilfred and stay wheres rashleigh ay heres rashleigh take thy long body aside thornie and lets see thy brother a bit your cousin rashleigh so thy father has thought on the old hall and old sir hildebrand at last better late than never thou art welcome lad and theres enough wheres my little die ay here she comes this is my niece die my wifes brothers daughter the prettiest girl in our dales be the other who she may and so now lets to the sirloin to gain some idea of the person who held this language you must suppose my dear tresham a man aged about sixty in a hunting suit which had once been richly laced but whose splendour had been tarnished by many a november and december storm sir hildebrand notwithstanding the abruptness of his present manner had at one period of his life known courts and camps had held a commission in the army which encamped on hounslow heath previous to the revolution and recommended perhaps by his religion had been knighted about the same period by the unfortunate and illadvised james ii but the knights dreams of further preferment if he ever entertained any had died away at the crisis which drove his patron from the throne and since that period he had spent a sequestered life upon his native domains notwithstanding his rusticity however sir hildebrand retained much of the exterior of a gentleman and appeared among his sons as the remains of a corinthian pillar defaced and overgrown with moss and lichen might have looked if contrasted with the rough unhewn masses of upright stones in stonhenge or any other druidical temple the sons were indeed heavy unadorned blocks as the eye would desire to look upon tall stout and comely all and each of the five eldest seemed to want alike the promethean fire of intellect and the exterior grace and manner which in the polished world sometimes supply mental deficiency their most valuable moral quality seemed to be the goodhumour and content which was expressed in their heavy features and their only pretence to accomplishment was their dexterity in field sports for which alone they lived the strong gyas and the strong cloanthus are not less distinguished by the poet than the strong percival the strong thorncliff the strong john richard and wilfred osbaldistones were by outward appearance but as if to indemnify herself for a uniformity so uncommon in her productions dame nature had rendered rashleigh osbaldistone a striking contrast in person and manner and as i afterwards learned in temper and talents not only to his brothers but to most men whom i had hitherto met with when percie thornie and co had respectively nodded grinned and presented their shoulder rather than their hand as their father named them to their new kinsman rashleigh stepped forward and welcomed me to osbaldistone hall with the air and manner of a man of the world his appearance was not in itself prepossessing he was of low stature whereas all his brethren seemed to be descendants of anak and while they were handsomely formed rashleigh though strong in person was bullnecked and crossmade and from some early injury in his youth had an imperfection in his gait so much resembling an absolute halt that many alleged that it formed the obstacle to his taking orders the church of rome as is well known admitting none to the clerical profession who labours under any personal deformity others however ascribed this unsightly defect to a mere awkward habit and contended that it did not amount to a personal disqualification from holy orders the features of rashleigh were such as having looked upon we in vain wish to banish from our memory to which they recur as objects of painful curiosity although we dwell upon them with a feeling of dislike and even of disgust it was not the actual plainness of his face taken separately from the meaning which made this strong impression his features were indeed irregular but they were by no means vulgar and his keen dark eyes and shaggy eyebrows redeemed his face from the charge of commonplace ugliness but there was in these eyes an expression of art and design and on provocation a ferocity tempered by caution which nature had made obvious to the most ordinary physiognomist perhaps with the same intention that she has given the rattle to the poisonous snake as if to compensate him for these disadvantages of exterior rashleigh osbaldistone was possessed of a voice the most soft mellow and rich in its tones that i ever heard and was at no loss for language of every sort suited to so fine an organ his first sentence of welcome was hardly ended ere i internally agreed with miss vernon that my new kinsman would make an instant conquest of a mistress whose ears alone were to judge his cause he was about to place himself beside me at dinner but miss vernon who as the only female in the family arranged all such matters according to her own pleasure contrived that i should sit betwixt thorncliff and herself and it can scarce be doubted that i favoured this more advantageous arrangement i want to speak with you she said and i have placed honest thornie betwixt rashleigh and you on purpose he will be like featherbed twixt castle wall and heavy brunt of cannon ball while i your earliest acquaintance in this intellectual family ask of you how you like us all a very comprehensive question miss vernon considering how short while i have been at osbaldistone hall oh the philosophy of our family lies on the surface there are minute shades distinguishing the individuals which require the eye of an intelligent observer but the species as naturalists i believe call it may be distinguished and characterized at once my five elder cousins then are i presume of pretty nearly the same character yes they form a happy compound of sot gamekeeper bully horsejockey and fool but as they say there cannot be found two leaves on the same tree exactly alike so these happy ingredients being mingled in somewhat various proportions in each individual make an agreeable variety for those who like to study character give me a sketch if you please miss vernon you shall have them all in a familypiece at full length the favour is too easily granted to be refused percie the son and heir has more of the sot than of the gamekeeper bully horsejockey or fool my precious thornie is more of the bully than the sot gamekeeper jockey or fool john who sleeps whole weeks amongst the hills has most of the gamekeeper the jockey is powerful with dickon who rides two hundred miles by day and night to be bought and sold at a horserace and the fool predominates so much over wilfreds other qualities that he may be termed a fool positive a goodly collection miss vernon and the individual varieties belong to a most interesting species but is there no room on the canvas for sir hildebrand i love my uncle was her reply i owe him some kindness such it was meant for at least and i will leave you to draw his picture yourself when you know him better come thought i to myself i am glad there is some forbearance after all who would have looked for such bitter satire from a creature so young and so exquisitely beautiful you are thinking of me she said bending her dark eyes on me as if she meant to pierce through my very soul i certainly was i replied with some embarrassment at the determined suddenness of the question and then endeavouring to give a complimentary turn to my frank avowal how is it possible i should think of anything else seated as i have the happiness to be she smiled with such an expression of concentrated haughtiness as she alone could have thrown into her countenance i must inform you at once mr osbaldistone that compliments are entirely lost upon me do not therefore throw away your pretty sayings they serve fine gentlemen who travel in the country instead of the toys beads and bracelets which navigators carry to propitiate the savage inhabitants of newlydiscovered lands do not exhaust your stock in trade you will find natives in northumberland to whom your fine things will recommend you on me they would be utterly thrown away for i happen to know their real value i was silenced and confounded you remind me at this moment said the young lady resuming her lively and indifferent manner of the fairy tale where the man finds all the money which he had carried to market suddenly changed into pieces of slate i have cried down and ruined your whole stock of complimentary discourse by one unlucky observation but come never mind it you are belied mr osbaldistone unless you have much better conversation than these fadeurs which every gentleman with a toupet thinks himself obliged to recite to an unfortunate girl merely because she is dressed in silk and gauze while he wears superfine cloth with embroidery your natural paces as any of my five cousins might say are far preferable to your complimentary amble endeavour to forget my unlucky sex call me tom vernon if you have a mind but speak to me as you would to a friend and companion you have no idea how much i shall like you that would be a bribe indeed returned i again replied miss vernon holding up her finger i told you i would not bear the shadow of a compliment and now when you have pledged my uncle who threatens you with what he calls a brimmer i will tell you what you think of me the bumper being pledged by me as a dutiful nephew and some other general intercourse of the table having taken place the continued and businesslike clang of knives and forks and the devotion of cousin thorncliff on my right hand and cousin dickon who sate on miss vernons left to the huge quantities of meat with which they heaped their plates made them serve as two occasional partitions separating us from the rest of the company and leaving us to our teteatete and now said i give me leave to ask you frankly miss vernon what you suppose i am thinking of you i could tell you what i really do think but you have interdicted praise i do not want your assistance i am conjuror enough to tell your thoughts without it you need not open the casement of your bosom i see through it you think me a strange bold girl half coquette half romp desirous of attracting attention by the freedom of her manners and loudness of her conversation because she is ignorant of what the spectator calls the softer graces of the sex and perhaps you think i have some particular plan of storming you into admiration i should be sorry to shock your selfopinion but you were never more mistaken all the confidence i have reposed in you i would have given as readily to your father if i thought he could have understood me i am in this happy family as much secluded from intelligent listeners as sancho in the sierra morena and when opportunity offers i must speak or die i assure you i would not have told you a word of all this curious intelligence had i cared a pin who knew it or knew it not it is very cruel in you miss vernon to take away all particular marks of favour from your communications but i must receive them on your own terms you have not included mr rashleigh osbaldistone in your domestic sketches she shrunk i thought at this remark and hastily answered in a much lower tone not a word of rashleigh his ears are so acute when his selfishness is interested that the sounds would reach him even through the mass of thorncliffs person stuffed as it is with beef venisonpasty and pudding yes i replied but peeping past the living screen which divides us before i put the question i perceived that mr rashleighs chair was empty he has left the table i would not have you be too sure of that miss vernon replied take my advice and when you speak of rashleigh get up to the top of otterscopehill where you can see for twenty miles round you in every direction stand on the very peak and speak in whispers and after all dont be too sure that the bird of the air will not carry the matter rashleigh has been my tutor for four years we are mutually tired of each other and we shall heartily rejoice at our approaching separation mr rashleigh leaves osbaldistone hall then yes in a few days did you not know that your father must keep his resolutions much more secret than sir hildebrand why when my uncle was informed that you were to be his guest for some time and that your father desired to have one of his hopeful sons to fill up the lucrative situation in his countinghouse which was vacant by your obstinacy mr francis the good knight held a cour pleniere of all his family including the butler housekeeper and gamekeeper this reverend assembly of the peers and household officers of osbaldistone hall was not convoked as you may suppose to elect your substitute because as rashleigh alone possessed more arithmetic than was necessary to calculate the odds on a fighting cock none but he could be supposed qualified for the situation but some solemn sanction was necessary for transforming rashleighs destination from starving as a catholic priest to thriving as a wealthy banker and it was not without some reluctance that the acquiescence of the assembly was obtained to such an act of degradation i can conceive the scruples but how were they got over by the general wish i believe to get rashleigh out of the house replied miss vernon although youngest of the family he has somehow or other got the entire management of all the others and every one is sensible of the subjection though they cannot shake it off if any one opposes him he is sure to rue having done so before the year goes about and if you do him a very important service you may rue it still more at that rate answered i smiling i should look about me for i have been the cause however unintentionally of his change of situation yes and whether he regards it as an advantage or disadvantage he will owe you a grudge for it but here comes cheese radishes and a bumper to church and king the hint for chaplains and ladies to disappear and i the sole representative of womanhood at osbaldistone hall retreat as in duty bound she vanished as she spoke leaving me in astonishment at the mingled character of shrewdness audacity and frankness which her conversation displayed i despair conveying to you the least idea of her manner although i have as nearly as i can remember imitated her language in fact there was a mixture of untaught simplicity as well as native shrewdness and haughty boldness in her manner and all were modified and recommended by the play of the most beautiful features i had ever beheld it is not to be thought that however strange and uncommon i might think her liberal and unreserved communications a young man of twoandtwenty was likely to be severely critical on a beautiful girl of eighteen for not observing a proper distance towards him on the contrary i was equally diverted and flattered by miss vernons confidence and that notwithstanding her declaration of its being conferred on me solely because i was the first auditor who occurred of intelligence enough to comprehend it with the presumption of my age certainly not diminished by my residence in france i imagined that wellformed features and a handsome person both which i conceived myself to possess were not unsuitable qualifications for the confidant of a young beauty my vanity thus enlisted in miss vernons behalf i was far from judging her with severity merely for a frankness which i supposed was in some degree justified by my own personal merit and the feelings of partiality which her beauty and the singularity of her situation were of themselves calculated to excite were enhanced by my opinion of her penetration and judgment in her choice of a friend after miss vernon quitted the apartment the bottle circulated or rather flew around the table in unceasing revolution my foreign education had given me a distaste to intemperance then and yet too common a vice among my countrymen the conversation which seasoned such orgies was as little to my taste and if anything could render it more disgusting it was the relationship of the company i therefore seized a lucky opportunity and made my escape through a side door leading i knew not whither rather than endure any longer the sight of father and sons practising the same degrading intemperance and holding the same coarse and disgusting conversation i was pursued of course as i had expected to be reclaimed by force as a deserter from the shrine of bacchus when i heard the whoop and hollo and the tramp of the heavy boots of my pursuers on the winding stair which i was descending i plainly foresaw i should be overtaken unless i could get into the open air i therefore threw open a casement in the staircase which looked into an oldfashioned garden and as the height did not exceed six feet i jumped out without hesitation and soon heard far behind the hey whoop stole away stole away of my baffled pursuers i ran down one alley walked fast up another and then conceiving myself out of all danger of pursuit i slackened my pace into a quiet stroll enjoying the cool air which the heat of the wine i had been obliged to swallow as well as that of my rapid retreat rendered doubly grateful as i sauntered on i found the gardener hard at his evening employment and saluted him as i paused to look at his work good even my friend gude een gude een tye answered the man without looking up and in a tone which at once indicated his northern extraction fine weather for your work my friend its no that muckle to be compleened o answered the man with that limited degree of praise which gardeners and farmers usually bestow on the very best weather then raising his head as if to see who spoke to him he touched his scotch bonnet with an air of respect as he observed eh gude safe us its a sight for sair een to see a goldlaced jeistiecor in the hagarden sae late at een a goldlaced what my good friend ou a jeistiecor thats a jacket like your ain there they perhaps from the french justeaucorps hae other things to do wi them up yonder unbuttoning them to make room for the beef and the bagpuddings and the claretwine nae doubt thats the ordinary for evening lecture on this side the border theres no such plenty of good cheer in your country my good friend i replied as to tempt you to sit so late at it hout sir ye ken little about scotland its no for want of gude vivers the best of fish flesh and fowl hae we by sybos ingans turneeps and other garden fruit but we hae mense and discretion and are moderate of our mouths but here frae the kitchen to the ha its fill and fetch mair frae the tae end of the fourandtwenty till the tother even their fast days they ca it fasting when they hae the best o seafish frae hartlepool and sunderland by land carriage forbye trouts grilses salmon and a the lave ot and so they make their very fasting a kind of luxury and abomination and then the awfu masses and matins of the puir deceived souls but i shouldna speak about them for your honour will be a roman ise warrant like the lave not i my friend i was bred an english presbyterian or dissenter the right hand of fellowship to your honour then quoth the gardener with as much alacrity as his hard features were capable of expressing and as if to show that his goodwill did not rest on words he plucked forth a huge horn snuffbox or mull as he called it and proffered a pinch with a most fraternal grin having accepted his courtesy i asked him if he had been long a domestic at osbaldistone hall i have been fighting with wild beasts at ephesus said he looking towards the building for the best part of these fourandtwenty years as sure as my names andrew fairservice but my excellent friend andrew fairservice if your religion and your temperance are so much offended by roman rituals and southern hospitality it seems to me that you must have been putting yourself to an unnecessary penance all this while and that you might have found a service where they eat less and are more orthodox in their worship i dare say it cannot be want of skill which prevented your being placed more to your satisfaction it disna become me to speak to the point of my qualifications said andrew looking round him with great complacency but nae doubt i should understand my trade of horticulture seeing i was bred in the parish of dreepdaily where they raise langkale under glass and force the early nettles for their spring kale and to speak truth i hae been flitting every term these fourandtwenty years but when the time comes theres aye something to saw that i would like to see sawn or something to maw that i would like to see mawn or something to ripe that i would like to see ripen and sae i een daiker on wi the family frae years end to years end and i wad say for certain that i am gaun to quit at cannlemas only i was just as positive on it twenty years syne and i find mysell still turning up the mouls here for a that forbye that to tell your honour the evendown truth theres nae better place ever offered to andrew but if your honour wad wush me to ony place where i wad hear pure doctrine and hae a free cows grass and a cot and a yard and mair than ten punds of annual fee and where theres nae leddy about the town to count the apples ise hold mysell muckle indebted tye bravo andrew i perceive youll lose no preferment for want of asking patronage i canna see what for i should replied andrew its no a generation to wait till anes worths discovered i trow but you are no friend i observe to the ladies na by my troth i keep up the first gardeners quarrel to them theyre fasheous bargains aye crying for apricocks pears plums and apples summer and winter without distinction o seasons but we hae nae slices o the spare rib here be praised fort except auld martha and shes weel eneugh pleased wi the freedom o the berrybushes to her sisters weans when they come to drink tea in a holiday in the housekeepers room and wi a wheen codlings now and then for her ain private supper you forget your young mistress what mistress do i forget whaes that your young mistress miss vernon what the lassie vernon shes nae mistress o mine man i wish she was her ain mistress and i wish she mayna be some other bodys mistress or its lang shes a wild slip that indeed said i more interested than i cared to own to myself or to show to the fellow why andrew you know all the secrets of this family if i ken them i can keep them said andrew they winna work in my wame like harm in a barrel ise warrant ye miss die is but its neither beef nor brose o mine and he began to dig with a great semblance of assiduity what is miss vernon andrew i am a friend of the family and should like to know other than a gude ane im fearing said andrew closing one eye hard and shaking his head with a grave and mysterious look something gleed your honour understands me i cannot say i do said i andrew but i should like to hear you explain yourself and therewithal i slipped a crownpiece into andrews hornhard hand the touch of the silver made him grin a ghastly smile as he nodded slowly and thrust it into his breeches pocket and then like a man who well understood that there was value to be returned stood up and rested his arms on his spade with his features composed into the most important gravity as for some serious communication ye maun ken then young gentleman since it imports you to know that miss vernon is here breaking off he sucked in both his cheeks till his lantern jaws and long chin assumed the appearance of a pair of nutcrackers winked hard once more frowned shook his head and seemed to think his physiognomy had completed the information which his tongue had not fully told good god said i so young so beautiful so early lost troth ye may say sae shes in a manner lost body and saul forby being a papist ise uphaud her for and his northern caution prevailed and he was again silent for what sir said i sternly i insist on knowing the plain meaning of all this on just for the bitterest jacobite in the haill shire pshaw a jacobite is that all andrew looked at me with some astonishment at hearing his information treated so lightly and then muttering aweel its the warst thing i ken aboot the lassie howsoeer he resumed his spade like the king of the vandals in marmontels late novel chapter seventh bardolph the sheriff with a monstrous watch is at the door henry iv first part i found out with some difficulty the apartment which was destined for my accommodation and having secured myself the necessary goodwill and attention from my uncles domestics by using the means they were most capable of comprehending i secluded myself there for the remainder of the evening conjecturing from the fair way in which i had left my new relatives as well as from the distant noise which continued to echo from the stonehall as their banquetingroom was called that they were not likely to be fitting company for a sober man what could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange family was my first and most natural reflection my uncle it was plain received me as one who was to make some stay with him and his rude hospitality rendered him as indifferent as king hal to the number of those who fed at his cost but it was plain my presence or absence would be of as little importance in his eyes as that of one of his bluecoated servingmen my cousins were mere cubs in whose company i might if i liked it unlearn whatever decent manners or elegant accomplishments i had acquired but where i could attain no information beyond what regarded worming dogs rowelling horses and following foxes i could only imagine one reason which was probably the true one my father considered the life which was led at osbaldistone hall as the natural and inevitable pursuits of all country gentlemen and he was desirous by giving me an opportunity of seeing that with which he knew i should be disgusted to reconcile me if possible to take an active share in his own business in the meantime he would take rashleigh osbaldistone into the countinghouse but he had an hundred modes of providing for him and that advantageously whenever he chose to get rid of him so that although i did feel a certain qualm of conscience at having been the means of introducing rashleigh being such as he was described by miss vernon into my fathers business perhaps into his confidence i subdued it by the reflection that my father was complete master of his own affairs a man not to be imposed upon or influenced by any one and that all i knew to the young gentlemans prejudice was through the medium of a singular and giddy girl whose communications were made with an injudicious frankness which might warrant me in supposing her conclusions had been hastily or inaccurately formed then my mind naturally turned to miss vernon herself her extreme beauty her very peculiar situation relying solely upon her reflections and her own spirit for guidance and protection and her whole character offering that variety and spirit which piques our curiosity and engages our attention in spite of ourselves i had sense enough to consider the neighbourhood of this singular young lady and the chance of our being thrown into very close and frequent intercourse as adding to the dangers while it relieved the dulness of osbaldistone hall but i could not with the fullest exertion of my prudence prevail upon myself to regret excessively this new and particular hazard to which i was to be exposed this scruple i also settled as young men settle most difficulties of the kind i would be very cautious always on my guard consider miss vernon rather as a companion than an intimate and all would do well enough with these reflections i fell asleep miss vernon of course forming the last subject of my contemplation whether i dreamed of her or not i cannot satisfy you for i was tired and slept soundly but she was the first person i thought of in the morning when waked at dawn by the cheerful notes of the hunting horn to start up and direct my horse to be saddled was my first movement and in a few minutes i was in the courtyard where men dogs and horses were in full preparation my uncle who perhaps was not entitled to expect a very alert sportsman in his nephew bred as he had been in foreign parts seemed rather surprised to see me and i thought his morning salutation wanted something of the hearty and hospitable tone which distinguished his first welcome art there lad ay youths aye rathe but look to thysell mind the old song lad he that gallops his horse on blackstone edge may chance to catch a fall i believe there are few young men and those very sturdy moralists who would not rather be taxed with some moral peccadillo than with want of knowledge in horsemanship as i was by no means deficient either in skill or courage i resented my uncles insinuation accordingly and assured him he would find me up with the hounds i doubtna lad was his reply thourt a rank rider ise warrant thee but take heed thy father sent thee here to me to be bitted and i doubt i must ride thee on the curb or well hae some one to ride thee on the halter if i takena the better heed as this speech was totally unintelligible to me as besides it did not seem to be delivered for my use or benefit but was spoken as it were aside and as if expressing aloud something which was passing through the mind of my muchhonoured uncle i concluded it must either refer to my desertion of the bottle on the preceding evening or that my uncles morning hours being a little discomposed by the revels of the night before his temper had suffered in proportion i only made the passing reflection that if he played the ungracious landlord i would remain the shorter while his guest and then hastened to salute miss vernon who advanced cordially to meet me some show of greeting also passed between my cousins and me but as i saw them maliciously bent upon criticising my dress and accoutrements from the cap to the stirrupirons and sneering at whatever had a new or foreign appearance i exempted myself from the task of paying them much attention and assuming in requital of their grins and whispers an air of the utmost indifference and contempt i attached myself to miss vernon as the only person in the party whom i could regard as a suitable companion by her side therefore we sallied forth to the destined cover which was a dingle or copse on the side of an extensive common as we rode thither i observed to diana that i did not see my cousin rashleigh in the field to which she replied o no hes a mighty hunter but its after the fashion of nimrod and his game is man the dogs now brushed into the cover with the appropriate encouragement from the hunters all was business bustle and activity my cousins were soon too much interested in the business of the morning to take any further notice of me unless that i overheard dickon the horsejockey whisper to wilfred the fool look thou an our french cousin be nat off a first burst to which wilfred answered like enow for he has a queer outlandish binding ons castor thorncliff however who in his rude way seemed not absolutely insensible to the beauty of his kinswoman appeared determined to keep us company more closely than his brothers perhaps to watch what passed betwixt miss vernon and me perhaps to enjoy my expected mishaps in the chase in the last particular he was disappointed after beating in vain for the greater part of the morning a fox was at length found who led us a chase of two hours in the course of which notwithstanding the illomened french binding upon my hat i sustained my character as a horseman to the admiration of my uncle and miss vernon and the secret disappointment of those who expected me to disgrace it reynard however proved too wily for his pursuers and the hounds were at fault i could at this time observe in miss vernons manner an impatience of the close attendance which we received from thorncliff osbaldistone and as that activespirited young lady never hesitated at taking the readiest means to gratify any wish of the moment she said to him in a tone of reproach i wonder thornie what keeps you dangling at my horses crupper all this morning when you know the earths above woolvertonmill are not stopt i know no such an thing then miss die for the miller swore himself as black as night that he stopt them at twelve oclock midnight that was o fie upon you thornie would you trust to a millers word and these earths too where we lost the fox three times this season and you on your grey mare that can gallop there and back in ten minutes well miss die ise go to woolverton then and if the earths are not stopt ise raddle dick the millers bones for him do my dear thornie horsewhip the rascal to purpose via fly away and about it thorncliff went off at the gallop or get horsewhipt yourself which will serve my purpose just as well i must teach them all discipline and obedience to the word of command i am raising a regiment you must know thornie shall be my sergeantmajor dickon my ridingmaster and wilfred with his deep dubadub tones that speak but three syllables at a time my kettledrummer and rashleigh rashleigh shall be my scoutmaster and will you find no employment for me most lovely colonel you shall have the choice of being paymaster or plundermaster to the corps but see how the dogs puzzle about there come mr frank the scents cold they wont recover it there this while follow me i have a view to show you and in fact she cantered up to the top of a gentle hill commanding an extensive prospect casting her eyes around to see that no one was near us she drew up her horse beneath a few birchtrees which screened us from the rest of the huntingfield do you see yon peaked brown heathy hill having something like a whitish speck upon the side terminating that long ridge of broken moorish uplands i see it distinctly that whitish speck is a rock called hawkesmorecrag and hawkesmorecrag is in scotland indeed i did not think we had been so near scotland it is so i assure you and your horse will carry you there in two hours i shall hardly give him the trouble why the distance must be eighteen miles as the crow flies you may have my mare if you think her less blown i say that in two hours you may be in scotland and i say that i have so little desire to be there that if my horses head were over the border i would not give his tail the trouble of following what should i do in scotland provide for your safety if i must speak plainly do you understand me now mr frank not a whit you are more and more oracular then on my word you either mistrust me most unjustly and are a better dissembler than rashleigh osbaldistone himself or you know nothing of what is imputed to you and then no wonder you stare at me in that grave manner which i can scarce see without laughing upon my word of honour miss vernon said i with an impatient feeling of her childish disposition to mirth i have not the most distant conception of what you mean i am happy to afford you any subject of amusement but i am quite ignorant in what it consists nay theres no sound jest after all said the young lady composing herself only one looks so very ridiculous when he is fairly perplexed but the matter is serious enough do you know one moray or morris or some such name not that i can at present recollect think a moment did you not lately travel with somebody of such a name the only man with whom i travelled for any length of time was a fellow whose soul seemed to lie in his portmanteau then it was like the soul of the licentiate pedro garcias which lay among the ducats in his leathern purse that man has been robbed and he has lodged an information against you as connected with the violence done to him you jest miss vernon i do not i assure you the thing is an absolute fact and do you said i with strong indignation which i did not attempt to suppress do you suppose me capable of meriting such a charge you would call me out for it i suppose had i the advantage of being a man you may do so as it is if you like it i can shoot flying as well as leap a fivebarred gate and are colonel of a regiment of horse besides replied i reflecting how idle it was to be angry with her but do explain the present jest to me theres no jest whatever said diana you are accused of robbing this man and my uncle believes it as well as i did upon my honour i am greatly obliged to my friends for their good opinion now do not if you can help it snort and stare and snuff the wind and look so exceedingly like a startled horse theres no such offence as you suppose you are not charged with any petty larceny or vulgar felony by no means this fellow was carrying money from government both specie and bills to pay the troops in the north and it is said he has been also robbed of some despatches of great consequence and so it is high treason then and not simple robbery of which i am accused certainly which you know has been in all ages accounted the crime of a gentleman you will find plenty in this country and one not far from your elbow who think it a merit to distress the hanoverian government by every means possible neither my politics nor my morals miss vernon are of a description so accommodating i really begin to believe that you are a presbyterian and hanoverian in good earnest but what do you propose to do instantly to refute this atrocious calumny before whom i asked was this extraordinary accusation laid before old squire inglewood who had sufficient unwillingness to receive it he sent tidings to my uncle i suppose that he might smuggle you away into scotland out of reach of the warrant but my uncle is sensible that his religion and old predilections render him obnoxious to government and that were he caught playing booty he would be disarmed and probably dismounted which would be the worse evil of the two as a jacobite papist and suspected person on occasions of public alarm in the beginning of the eighteenth century the horses of the catholics were often seized upon as they were always supposed to be on the eve of rising in rebellion i can conceive that sooner than lose his hunters he would give up his nephew his nephew nieces sons daughters if he had them and whole generation said diana therefore trust not to him even for a single moment but make the best of your way before they can serve the warrant that i shall certainly do but it shall be to the house of this squire inglewood which way does it lie about five miles off in the low ground behind yonder plantations you may see the tower of the clockhouse i will be there in a few minutes said i putting my horse in motion and i will go with you and show you the way said diana putting her palfrey also to the trot do not think of it miss vernon i replied it is not permit me the freedom of a friend it is not proper scarcely even delicate in you to go with me on such an errand as i am now upon i understand your meaning said miss vernon a slight blush crossing her haughty brow it is plainly spoken and after a moments pause she added and i believe kindly meant it is indeed miss vernon can you think me insensible of the interest you show me or ungrateful for it said i with even more earnestness than i could have wished to express yours is meant for true kindness shown best at the hour of need but i must not for your own sake for the chance of misconstruction suffer you to pursue the dictates of your generosity this is so public an occasion it is almost like venturing into an open court of justice and if it were not almost but altogether entering into an open court of justice do you think i would not go there if i thought it right and wished to protect a friend you have no one to stand by you you are a stranger and here in the outskirts of the kingdom country justices do odd things my uncle has no desire to embroil himself in your affair rashleigh is absent and were he here there is no knowing which side he might take the rest are all more stupid and brutal one than another i will go with you and i do not fear being able to serve you i am no fine lady to be terrified to death with lawbooks hard words or big wigs but my dear miss vernon but my dear mr francis be patient and quiet and let me take my own way for when i take the bit between my teeth there is no bridle will stop me flattered with the interest so lovely a creature seemed to take in my fate yet vexed at the ridiculous appearance i should make by carrying a girl of eighteen along with me as an advocate and seriously concerned for the misconstruction to which her motives might be exposed i endeavoured to combat her resolution to accompany me to squire inglewoods the selfwilled girl told me roundly that my dissuasions were absolutely in vain that she was a true vernon whom no consideration not even that of being able to do but little to assist him should induce to abandon a friend in distress and that all i could say on the subject might be very well for pretty welleducated wellbehaved misses from a town boardingschool but did not apply to her who was accustomed to mind nobodys opinion but her own while she spoke thus we were advancing hastily towards inglewood place while as if to divert me from the task of further remonstrance she drew a ludicrous picture of the magistrate and his clerk inglewood was according to her description a whitewashed jacobite that is one who having been long a nonjuror like most of the other gentlemen of the country had lately qualified himself to act as a justice by taking the oaths to government he had done so she said in compliance with the urgent request of most of his brother squires who saw with regret that the palladium of silvan sport the gamelaws were likely to fall into disuse for want of a magistrate who would enforce them the nearest acting justice being the mayor of newcastle and he as being rather inclined to the consumption of the game when properly dressed than to its preservation when alive was more partial of course to the cause of the poacher than of the sportsman resolving therefore that it was expedient some one of their number should sacrifice the scruples of jacobitical loyalty to the good of the community the northumbrian country gentlemen imposed the duty on inglewood who being very inert in most of his feelings and sentiments might they thought comply with any political creed without much repugnance having thus procured the body of justice they proceeded continued miss vernon to attach to it a clerk by way of soul to direct and animate its movements accordingly they got a sharp newcastle attorney called jobson who to vary my metaphor finds it a good thing enough to retail justice at the sign of squire inglewood and as his own emoluments depend on the quantity of business which he transacts he hooks in his principal for a great deal more employment in the justice line than the honest squire had ever bargained for so that no applewife within the circuit of ten miles can settle her account with a costermonger without an audience of the reluctant justice and his alert clerk mr joseph jobson but the most ridiculous scenes occur when affairs come before him like our business of today having any colouring of politics mr joseph jobson for which no doubt he has his own very sufficient reasons is a prodigious zealot for the protestant religion and a great friend to the present establishment in church and state now his principal retaining a sort of instinctive attachment to the opinions which he professed openly until he relaxed his political creed with the patriotic view of enforcing the law against unauthorized destroyers of blackgame grouse partridges and hares is peculiarly embarrassed when the zeal of his assistant involves him in judicial proceedings connected with his earlier faith and instead of seconding his zeal he seldom fails to oppose to it a double dose of indolence and lack of exertion and this inactivity does not by any means arise from actual stupidity on the contrary for one whose principal delight is in eating and drinking he is an alert joyous and lively old soul which makes his assumed dulness the more diverting so you may see jobson on such occasions like a bit of a broken down bloodtit condemned to drag an overloaded cart puffing strutting and spluttering to get the justice put in motion while though the wheels groan creak and revolve slowly the great and preponderating weight of the vehicle fairly frustrates the efforts of the willing quadruped and prevents its being brought into a state of actual progression nay more the unfortunate pony i understand has been heard to complain that this same car of justice which he finds it so hard to put in motion on some occasions can on others run fast enough down hill of its own accord dragging his reluctant self backwards along with it when anything can be done of service to squire inglewoods quondam friends and then mr jobson talks big about reporting his principal to the secretary of state for the home department if it were not for his particular regard and friendship for mr inglewood and his family as miss vernon concluded this whimsical description we found ourselves in front of inglewood place a handsome though oldfashioned building which showed the consequence of the family chapter eighth sir quoth the lawyer not to flatter ye you have as good and fair a battery as heart could wish and need not shame the proudest man alive to claim butler our horses were taken by a servant in sir hildebrands livery whom we found in the courtyard and we entered the house in the entrancehall i was somewhat surprised and my fair companion still more so when we met rashleigh osbaldistone who could not help showing equal wonder at our rencontre rashleigh said miss vernon without giving him time to ask any question you have heard of mr francis osbaldistones affair and you have been talking to the justice about it certainly said rashleigh composedly it has been my business here i have been endeavouring he said with a bow to me to render my cousin what service i can but i am sorry to meet him here as a friend and relation mr osbaldistone you ought to have been sorry to have met me anywhere else at a time when the charge of my reputation required me to be on this spot as soon as possible true but judging from what my father said i should have supposed a short retreat into scotland just till matters should be smoothed over in a quiet way i answered with warmth that i had no prudential measures to observe and desired to have nothing smoothed over on the contrary i was come to inquire into a rascally calumny which i was determined to probe to the bottom mr francis osbaldistone is an innocent man rashleigh said miss vernon and he demands an investigation of the charge against him and i intend to support him in it you do my pretty cousin i should think now mr francis osbaldistone was likely to be as effectually and rather more delicately supported by my presence than by yours oh certainly but two heads are better than one you know especially such a head as yours my pretty die advancing and taking her hand with a familiar fondness which made me think him fifty times uglier than nature had made him she led him however a few steps aside they conversed in an under voice and she appeared to insist upon some request which he was unwilling or unable to comply with i never saw so strong a contrast betwixt the expression of two faces miss vernons from being earnest became angry her eyes and cheeks became more animated her colour mounted she clenched her little hand and stamping on the ground with her tiny foot seemed to listen with a mixture of contempt and indignation to the apologies which from his look of civil deference his composed and respectful smile his body rather drawing back than advanced and other signs of look and person i concluded him to be pouring out at her feet at length she flung away from him with i will have it so it is not in my power there is no possibility of it would you think it mr osbaldistone said he addressing me you are not mad said she interrupting him would you think it said he without attending to her hint miss vernon insists not only that i know your innocence of which indeed it is impossible for any one to be more convinced but that i must also be acquainted with the real perpetrators of the outrage on this fellow if indeed such an outrage has been committed is this reasonable mr osbaldistone i will not allow any appeal to mr osbaldistone rashleigh said the young lady he does not know as i do the incredible extent and accuracy of your information on all points as i am a gentleman you do me more honour than i deserve justice rashleigh only justice and it is only justice which i expect at your hands you are a tyrant diana he answered with a sort of sigh a capricious tyrant and rule your friends with a rod of iron still however it shall be as you desire but you ought not to be here you know you ought not you must return with me then turning from diana who seemed to stand undecided he came up to me in the most friendly manner and said do not doubt my interest in what regards you mr osbaldistone if i leave you just at this moment it is only to act for your advantage but you must use your influence with your cousin to return her presence cannot serve you and must prejudice herself i assure you sir i replied you cannot be more convinced of this than i i have urged miss vernons return as anxiously as she would permit me to do i have thought on it said miss vernon after a pause and i will not go till i see you safe out of the hands of the philistines cousin rashleigh i dare say means well but he and i know each other well rashleigh i will not go i know she added in a more soothing tone my being here will give you more motive for speed and exertion stay then rash obstinate girl said rashleigh you know but too well to whom you trust and hastening out of the hall we heard his horses feet a minute afterwards in rapid motion thank heaven he is gone said diana and now let us seek out the justice had we not better call a servant oh by no means i know the way to his den we must burst on him suddenly follow me i did follow her accordingly as she tripped up a few gloomy steps traversed a twilight passage and entered a sort of anteroom hung round with old maps architectural elevations and genealogical trees a pair of foldingdoors opened from this into mr inglewoods sitting apartment from which was heard the fagend of an old ditty chanted by a voice which had been in its day fit for a jolly bottlesong o in skiptonincraven is never a haven but many a day foul weather and he that would say a pretty girl nay i wish for his cravat a tether heyday said miss vernon the genial justice must have dined already i did not think it had been so late it was even so mr inglewoods appetite having been sharpened by his official investigations he had antedated his meridian repast having dined at twelve instead of one oclock then the general dining hour in england the various occurrences of the morning occasioned our arriving some time after this hour to the justice the most important of the fourandtwenty and he had not neglected the interval stay you here said diana i know the house and i will call a servant your sudden appearance might startle the old gentleman even to choking and she escaped from me leaving me uncertain whether i ought to advance or retreat it was impossible for me not to hear some part of what passed within the dinner apartment and particularly several apologies for declining to sing expressed in a dejected croaking voice the tones of which i conceived were not entirely new to me not sing sir by our lady but you must what you have cracked my silvermounted cocoanut of sack and tell me that you cannot sing sir sack will make a cat sing and speak too so up with a merry stave or trundle yourself out of my doors do you think you are to take up all my valuable time with your dd declarations and then tell me you cannot sing your worship is perfectly in rule said another voice which from its pert conceited accent might be that of the cleric and the party must be conformable he hath canet written on his face in court hand up with it then said the justice or by st christopher you shall crack the cocoanut full of saltandwater according to the statute for such effect made and provided thus exhorted and threatened my quondam fellowtraveller for i could no longer doubt that he was the recusant in question uplifted with a voice similar to that of a criminal singing his last psalm on the scaffold a most doleful stave to the following effect good people all i pray give ear a woeful story you shall hear tis of a robber as stout as ever bade a true man stand and deliver with his foodle doo fa loodle loo this knave most worthy of a cord being armed with pistol and with sword twixt kensington and brentford then did boldly stop six honest men with his foodle doo etc these honest men did at brentford dine having drank each man his pint of wine when this bold thief with many curses did say you dogs your lives or purses with his foodle doo etc i question if the honest men whose misfortune is commemorated in this pathetic ditty were more startled at the appearance of the bold thief than the songster was at mine for tired of waiting for some one to announce me and finding my situation as a listener rather awkward i presented myself to the company just as my friend mr morris for such it seems was his name was uplifting the fifth stave of his doleful ballad the high tone with which the tune started died away in a quaver of consternation on finding himself so near one whose character he supposed to be little less suspicious than that of the hero of his madrigal and he remained silent with a mouth gaping as if i had brought the gorgons head in my hand the justice whose eyes had closed under the influence of the somniferous lullaby of the song started up in his chair as it suddenly ceased and stared with wonder at the unexpected addition which the company had received while his organs of sight were in abeyance the clerk as i conjectured him to be from his appearance was also commoved for sitting opposite to mr morris that honest gentlemans terror communicated itself to him though he wotted not why illustration frank at judge inglewoods i broke the silence of surprise occasioned by my abrupt entrance my name mr inglewood is francis osbaldistone i understand that some scoundrel has brought a complaint before you charging me with being concerned in a loss which he says he has sustained sir said the justice somewhat peevishly these are matters i never enter upon after dinner there is a time for everything and a justice of peace must eat as well as other folks the goodly person of mr inglewood by the way seemed by no means to have suffered by any fasts whether in the service of the law or of religion i beg pardon for an illtimed visit sir but as my reputation is concerned and as the dinner appears to be concluded it is not concluded sir replied the magistrate man requires digestion as well as food and i protest i cannot have benefit from my victuals unless i am allowed two hours of quiet leisure intermixed with harmless mirth and a moderate circulation of the bottle if your honour will forgive me said mr jobson who had produced and arranged his writing implements in the brief space that our conversation afforded as this is a case of felony and the gentleman seems something impatient the charge is contra pacem domini regis d n dominie regis said the impatient justice i hope its no treason to say so but its enough to made one mad to be worried in this way have i a moment of my life quiet for warrants orders directions acts bails bonds and recognisances i pronounce to you mr jobson that i shall send you and the justiceship to the devil one of these days your honour will consider the dignity of the office one of the quorum and custos rotulorum an office of which sir edward coke wisely saith the whole christian world hath not the like of it so it be duly executed well said the justice partly reconciled by this eulogium on the dignity of his situation and gulping down the rest of his dissatisfaction in a huge bumper of claret let us to this gear then and get rid of it as fast as we can here you sir you morris you knight of the sorrowful countenance is this mr francis osbaldistone the gentleman whom you charge with being art and part of felony i sir replied morris whose scattered wits had hardly yet reassembled themselves i charge nothing i say nothing against the gentleman then we dismiss your complaint sir thats all and a good riddance push about the bottle mr osbaldistone help yourself jobson however was determined that morris should not back out of the scrape so easily what do you mean mr morris here is your own declaration the ink scarce dried and you would retract it in this scandalous manner how do i know whispered the other in a tremulous tone how many rogues are in the house to back him i have read of such things in johnsons lives of the highwaymen i protest the door opens and it did open and diana vernon entered you keep fine order here justice not a servant to be seen or heard of ah said the justice starting up with an alacrity which showed that he was not so engrossed by his devotions to themis or comus as to forget what was due to beauty ah ha die vernon the heathbell of cheviot and the blossom of the border come to see how the old bachelor keeps house art welcome girl as flowers in may a fine open hospitable house you do keep justice that must be allowed not a soul to answer a visitor ah the knaves they reckoned themselves secure of me for a couple of hours but why did you not come earlier your cousin rashleigh dined here and ran away like a poltroon after the first bottle was out but you have not dined well have something nice and ladylike sweet and pretty like yourself tossed up in a trice i may eat a crust in the anteroom before i set out answered miss vernon i have had a long ride this morning but i cant stay long justice i came with my cousin frank osbaldistone there and i must show him the way back again to the hall or hell lose himself in the wolds whew sits the wind in that quarter inquired the justice she showed him the way she showed him the way she showed him the way to woo what no luck for old fellows then my sweet bud of the wilderness none whatever squire inglewood but if you will be a good kind justice and despatch young franks business and let us canter home again ill bring my uncle to dine with you next week and well expect merry doings and you shall find them my pearl of the tyne zookers lass i never envy these young fellows their rides and scampers unless when you come across me but i must not keep you just now i suppose i am quite satisfied with mr francis osbaldistones explanation here has been some mistake which can be cleared at greater leisure pardon me sir said i but i have not heard the nature of the accusation yet yes sir said the clerk who at the appearance of miss vernon had given up the matter in despair but who picked up courage to press farther investigation on finding himself supported from a quarter whence assuredly he expected no backing yes sir and dalton saith that he who is apprehended as a felon shall not be discharged upon any mans discretion but shall be held either to bail or commitment paying to the clerk of the peace the usual fees for recognisance or commitment the justice thus goaded on gave me at length a few words of explanation it seems the tricks which i had played to this man morris had made a strong impression on his imagination for i found they had been arrayed against me in his evidence with all the exaggerations which a timorous and heated imagination could suggest it appeared also that on the day he parted from me he had been stopped on a solitary spot and eased of his beloved travellingcompanion the portmanteau by two men well mounted and armed having their faces covered with vizards one of them he conceived had much of my shape and air and in a whispering conversation which took place betwixt the freebooters he heard the other apply to him the name of osbaldistone the declaration farther set forth that upon inquiring into the principles of the family so named he the said declarant was informed that they were of the worst description the family in all its members having been papists and jacobites as he was given to understand by the dissenting clergyman at whose house he stopped after his rencontre since the days of william the conqueror upon all and each of these weighty reasons he charged me with being accessory to the felony committed upon his person he the said declarant then travelling in the special employment of government and having charge of certain important papers and also a large sum in specie to be paid over according to his instructions to certain persons of official trust and importance in scotland having heard this extraordinary accusation i replied to it that the circumstances on which it was founded were such as could warrant no justice or magistrate in any attempt on my personal liberty i admitted that i had practised a little upon the terrors of mr morris while we travelled together but in such trifling particulars as could have excited apprehension in no one who was one whit less timorous and jealous than himself but i added that i had never seen him since we parted and if that which he feared had really come upon him i was in nowise accessory to an action so unworthy of my character and station in life that one of the robbers was called osbaldistone or that such a name was mentioned in the course of the conversation betwixt them was a trifling circumstance to which no weight was due and concerning the disaffection alleged against me i was willing to prove to the satisfaction of the justice the clerk and even the witness himself that i was of the same persuasion as his friend the dissenting clergyman had been educated as a good subject in the principles of the revolution and as such now demanded the personal protection of the laws which had been assured by that great event the justice fidgeted took snuff and seemed considerably embarrassed while mr attorney jobson with all the volubility of his profession ran over the statute of the edward iii by which justices of the peace are allowed to arrest all those whom they find by indictment or suspicion and to put them into prison the rogue even turned my own admissions against me alleging that since i had confessedly upon my own showing assumed the bearing or deportment of a robber or malefactor i had voluntarily subjected myself to the suspicions of which i complained and brought myself within the compass of the act having wilfully clothed my conduct with all the colour and livery of guilt i combated both his arguments and his jargon with much indignation and scorn and observed that i should if necessary produce the bail of my relations which i conceived could not be refused without subjecting the magistrate in a misdemeanour pardon me my good sir pardon me said the insatiable clerk this is a case in which neither bail nor mainprize can be received the felon who is liable to be committed on heavy grounds of suspicion not being replevisable under the statute of the d of king edward there being in that act an express exception of such as be charged of commandment or force and aid of felony done and he hinted that his worship would do well to remember that such were no way replevisable by common writ nor without writ at this period of the conversation a servant entered and delivered a letter to mr jobson he had no sooner run it hastily over than he exclaimed with the air of one who wished to appear much vexed at the interruption and felt the consequence attached to a man of multifarious avocations good god why at this rate i shall have neither time to attend to the public concerns nor my own no rest no quiet i wish to heaven another gentleman in our line would settle here god forbid said the justice in a tone of sottovoce deprecation some of us have enough of one of the tribe this is a matter of life and death if your worship pleases in gods name no more justice business i hope said the alarmed magistrate no no replied mr jobson very consequentially old gaffer rutledge of grimeshill is subpoenaed for the next world he has sent an express for dr killdown to put in bail another for me to arrange his worldly affairs away with you then said mr inglewood hastily his may not be a replevisable case under the statute you know or mr justice death may not like the doctor for a main pernor or bailsman and yet said jobson lingering as he moved towards the door if my presence here be necessary i could make out the warrant for committal in a moment and the constable is below and you have heard he said lowering his voice mr rashleighs opinion the rest was lost in a whisper the justice replied aloud i tell thee no man no well do nought till thou return man tis but a fourmile ride come push the bottle mr morris dont be cast down mr osbaldistone and you my rose of the wilderness one cup of claret to refresh the bloom of your cheeks diana started as if from a reverie in which she appeared to have been plunged while we held this discussion no justice i should be afraid of transferring the bloom to a part of my face where it would show to little advantage but i will pledge you in a cooler beverage and filling a glass with water she drank it hastily while her hurried manner belied her assumed gaiety i had not much leisure to make remarks upon her demeanour however being full of vexation at the interference of fresh obstacles to an instant examination of the disgraceful and impertinent charge which was brought against me but there was no moving the justice to take the matter up in absence of his clerk an incident which gave him apparently as much pleasure as a holiday to a schoolboy he persisted in his endeavours to inspire jollity into a company the individuals of which whether considered with reference to each other or to their respective situations were by no means inclined to mirth come master morris youre not the first man thats been robbed i trow grieving neer brought back loss man and you mr frank osbaldistone are not the first bullyboy that has said stand to a true man there was jack winterfield in my young days kept the best company in the land at horseraces and cockfights who but he hand and glove was i with jack push the bottle mr morris its dry talking many quart bumpers have i cracked and thrown many a merry main with poor jack good family ready wit quick eye as honest a fellow barring the deed he died for well drink to his memory gentlemen poor jack winterfield and since we talk of him and of those sort of things and since that d d clerk of mine has taken his gibberish elsewhere and since were snug among ourselves mr osbaldistone if you will have my best advice i would take up this matter the laws hard very severe hanged poor jack winterfield at york despite family connections and great interest all for easing a fat westcountry grazier of the price of a few beasts now here is honest mr morris has been frightened and so forth d n it man let the poor fellow have back his portmanteau and end the frolic at once morriss eyes brightened up at this suggestion and he began to hesitate forth an assurance that he thirsted for no mans blood when i cut the proposed accommodation short by resenting the justices suggestion as an insult that went directly to suppose me guilty of the very crime which i had come to his house with the express intention of disavowing we were in this awkward predicament when a servant opening the door announced a strange gentleman to wait upon his honour and the party whom he thus described entered the room without farther ceremony illustration die vernon at judge inglewoods chapter ninth one of the thieves come back again ill stand close he dares not wrong me now so near the house and call in vain tis till i see him offer it the widow a stranger echoed the justice not upon business i trust for ill be his protestation was cut short by the answer of the man himself my business is of a nature somewhat onerous and particular said my acquaintance mr campbell for it was he the very scotchman whom i had seen at northallerton and i must solicit your honour to give instant and heedful consideration to it i believe mr morris he added fixing his eye on that person with a look of peculiar firmness and almost ferocity i believe ye ken brawly what i am i believe ye cannot have forgotten what passed at our last meeting on the road morriss jaw dropped his countenance became the colour of tallow his teeth chattered and he gave visible signs of the utmost consternation take heart of grace man said campbell and dinna sit clattering your jaws there like a pair of castanets i think there can be nae difficulty in your telling mr justice that ye have seen me of yore and ken me to be a cavalier of fortune and a man of honour ye ken fu weel ye will be some time resident in my vicinity when i may have the power as i will possess the inclination to do you as good a turn sir sir i believe you to be a man of honour and as you say a man of fortune yes mr inglewood he added clearing his voice i really believe this gentleman to be so and what are this gentlemans commands with me said the justice somewhat peevishly one man introduces another like the rhymes in the house that jack built and i get company without either peace or conversation both shall be yours sir answered campbell in a brief period of time i come to release your mind from a piece of troublesome duty not to make increment to it body o me then you are welcome as ever scot was to england and thats not saying much but get on man lets hear what you have got to say at once i presume this gentleman continued the north briton told you there was a person of the name of campbell with him when he had the mischance to lose his valise he has not mentioned such a name from beginning to end of the matter said the justice ah i conceive i conceive replied mr campbell mr morris was kindly afeared of committing a stranger into collision wi the judicial forms of the country but as i understand my evidence is necessary to the compurgation of one honest gentleman here mr francis osbaldistone wha has been most unjustly suspected i will dispense with the precaution ye will therefore he added addressing morris with the same determined look and accent please tell mr justice inglewood whether we did not travel several miles together on the road in consequence of your own anxious request and suggestion reiterated ance and again baith on the evening that we were at northallerton and there declined by me but afterwards accepted when i overtook ye on the road near cloberry allers and was prevailed on by you to resign my ain intentions of proceeding to rothbury and for my misfortune to accompany you on your proposed route its a melancholy truth answered morris holding down his head as he gave this general assent to the long and leading question which campbell put to him and seemed to acquiesce in the statement it contained with rueful docility and i presume you can also asseverate to his worship that no man is better qualified than i am to bear testimony in this case seeing that i was by you and near you constantly during the whole occurrence no man better qualified certainly said morris with a deep and embarrassed sigh and why the devil did you not assist him then said the justice since by mr morriss account there were but two robbers so you were two to two and you are both stout likely men sir if it please your worship said campbell i have been all my life a man of peace and quietness noways given to broils or batteries mr morris who belongs as i understand or hath belonged to his majestys army might have used his pleasure in resistance he travelling as i also understand with a great charge of treasure but for me who had but my own small peculiar to defend and who am moreover a man of a pacific occupation i was unwilling to commit myself to hazard in the matter i looked at campbell as he muttered these words and never recollect to have seen a more singular contrast than that between the strong daring sternness expressed in his harsh features and the air of composed meekness and simplicity which his language assumed there was even a slight ironical smile lurking about the corners of his mouth which seemed involuntarily as it were to intimate his disdain of the quiet and peaceful character which he thought proper to assume and which led me to entertain strange suspicions that his concern in the violence done to morris had been something very different from that of a fellowsufferer or even of a mere spectator perhaps some suspicious crossed the justices mind at the moment for he exclaimed as if by way of ejaculation body o me but this is a strange story the north briton seemed to guess at what was passing in his mind for he went on with a change of manner and tone dismissing from his countenance some part of the hypocritical affectation of humility which had made him obnoxious to suspicion and saying with a more frank and unconstrained air to say the truth i am just ane o those canny folks wha care not to fight but when they hae gotten something to fight for which did not chance to be my predicament when i fell in wi these loons but that your worship may know that i am a person of good fame and character please to cast your eye over that billet mr inglewood took the paper from his hand and read half aloud these are to certify that the bearer robert campbell of of some place which i cannot pronounce interjected the justice is a person of good lineage and peaceable demeanour travelling towards england on his own proper affairs c c c given under our hand at our castle of inver invera rara argyle a slight testimonial sir which i thought fit to impetrate from that worthy nobleman here he raised his hand to his head as if to touch his hat maccallum more maccallum who sir said the justice whom the southern call the duke of argyle i know the duke of argyle very well to be a nobleman of great worth and distinction and a true lover of his country i was one of those that stood by him in when he unhorsed the duke of marlborough out of his command i wish we had more noblemen like him he was an honest tory in those days and hand and glove with ormond and he has acceded to the present government as i have done myself for the peace and quiet of his country for i cannot presume that great man to have been actuated as violent folks pretend with the fear of losing his places and regiment his testimonial as you call it mr campbell is perfectly satisfactory and now what have you got to say to this matter of the robbery briefly this if it please your worship that mr morris might as weel charge it against the babe yet to be born or against myself even as against this young gentleman mr osbaldistone for i am not only free to depone that the person whom he took for him was a shorter man and a thicker man but also for i chanced to obtain a glisk of his visage as his fauseface slipped aside that he was a man of other features and complexion than those of this young gentleman mr osbaldistone and i believe he added turning round with a natural yet somewhat sterner air to mr morris that the gentleman will allow i had better opportunity to take cognisance wha were present on that occasion than he being i believe much the cooler o the twa i agree to it sir i agree to it perfectly said morris shrinking back as campbell moved his chair towards him to fortify his appeal and i incline sir he added addressing mr inglewood to retract my information as to mr osbaldistone and i request sir you will permit him sir to go about his business and me to go about mine also your worship may have business to settle with mr campbell and i am rather in haste to be gone then there go the declarations said the justice throwing them into the fire and now you are at perfect liberty mr osbaldistone and you mr morris are set quite at your ease ay said campbell eyeing morris as he assented with a rueful grin to the justices observations much like the ease of a tod under a pair of harrows but fear nothing mr morris you and i maun leave the house thegither i will see you safe i hope you will not doubt my honour when i say sae to the next highway and then we part company and if we do not meet as friends in scotland it will be your ain fault with such a lingering look of terror as the condemned criminal throws when he is informed that the cart awaits him morris arose but when on his legs appeared to hesitate i tell thee man fear nothing reiterated campbell i will keep my word with you why thou sheeps heart how do ye ken but we may can pick up some speerings of your valise if ye will be amenable to gude counsel our horses are ready bid the justice fareweel man and show your southern breeding morris thus exhorted and encouraged took his leave under the escort of mr campbell but apparently new scruples and terrors had struck him before they left the house for i heard campbell reiterating assurances of safety and protection as they left the anteroom by the soul of my body man thourt as safe as in thy fathers kailyard zounds that a chield wi sic a black beard should hae nae mair heart than a henpartridge come on wi ye like a frank fallow anes and for aye the voices died away and the subsequent trampling of their horses announced to us that they had left the mansion of justice inglewood the joy which that worthy magistrate received at this easy conclusion of a matter which threatened him with some trouble in his judicial capacity was somewhat damped by reflection on what his clerks views of the transaction might be at his return now i shall have jobson on my shoulders about these d d papers i doubt i should not have destroyed them after all but hang it it is only paying his fees and that will make all smooth and now miss die vernon though i have liberated all the others i intend to sign a writ for committing you to the custody of mother blakes my old housekeeper for the evening and we will send for my neighbour mrs musgrave and the miss dawkins and your cousins and have old cobs the fiddler and be as merry as the maids and frank osbaldistone and i will have a carouse that will make us fit company for you in halfanhour thanks most worshipful returned miss vernon but as matters stand we must return instantly to osbaldistone hall where they do not know what has become of us and relieve my uncle of his anxiety on my cousins account which is just the same as if one of his own sons were concerned i believe it truly said the justice for when his eldest son archie came to a bad end in that unlucky affair of sir john fenwicks old hildebrand used to hollo out his name as readily as any of the remaining six and then complain that he could not recollect which of his sons had been hanged so pray hasten home and relieve his paternal solicitude since go you must but hark thee hither heathblossom he said pulling her towards him by the hand and in a goodhumoured tone of admonition another time let the law take its course without putting your pretty finger into her old musty pie all full of fragments of law gibberish french and doglatin and die my beauty let young fellows show each other the way through the moors in case you should lose your own road while you are pointing out theirs my pretty will o the wisp with this admonition he saluted and dismissed miss vernon and took an equally kind farewell of me thou seems to be a good tight lad mr frank and i remember thy father too he was my playfellow at school hark thee lad ride early at night and dont swagger with chance passengers on the kings highway what man all the kings liege subjects are not bound to understand joking and its ill cracking jests on matters of felony and heres poor die vernon too in a manner alone and deserted on the face of this wide earth and left to ride and run and scamper at her own silly pleasure thou must be careful of die or egad i will turn a young fellow again on purpose and fight thee myself although i must own it would be a great deal of trouble and now get ye both gone and leave me to my pipe of tobacco and my meditations for what says the song the indian leaf doth briefly burn so doth mans strength to weakness turn the fire of youth extinguished quite comes age like embers dry and white think of this as you take tobacco the lines here quoted belong to or were altered from a set of verses at one time very popular in england beginning tobacco that is withered quite in scotland the celebrated ralph erskine author of the gospel sonnets published what he called smoking spiritualized in two parts the first part being an old meditation upon smoking tobacco it begins this indian weed now withered quite tho green at noon cut down at night shows thy decay all flesh is hay thus thank and smoke tobacco i was much pleased with the gleams of sense and feeling which escaped from the justice through the vapours of sloth and selfindulgence assured him of my respect to his admonitions and took a friendly farewell of the honest magistrate and his hospitable mansion we found a repast prepared for us in the anteroom which we partook of slightly and rejoined the same servant of sir hildebrand who had taken our horses at our entrance and who had been directed as he informed miss vernon by mr rashleigh to wait and attend upon us home we rode a little way in silence for to say truth my mind was too much bewildered with the events of the morning to permit me to be the first to break it at length miss vernon exclaimed as if giving vent to her own reflections well rashleigh is a man to be feared and wondered at and all but loved he does whatever he pleases and makes all others his puppets has a player ready to perform every part which he imagines and an invention and readiness which supply expedients for every emergency you think then said i answering rather to her meaning than to the express words she made use of that this mr campbell whose appearance was so opportune and who trussed up and carried off my accuser as a falcon trusses a partridge was an agent of mr rashleigh osbaldistones i do guess as much replied diana and shrewdly suspect moreover that he would hardly have appeared so very much in the nick of time if i had not happened to meet rashleigh in the hall at the justices in that case my thanks are chiefly due to you my fair preserver to be sure they are returned diana and pray suppose them paid and accepted with a gracious smile for i do not care to be troubled with hearing them in good earnest and am much more likely to yawn than to behave becoming in short mr frank i wished to serve you and i have fortunately been able to do so and have only one favour to ask in return and that is that you will say no more about it but who comes here to meet us bloody with spurring fieryred with haste it is the subordinate man of law i think no less than mr joseph jobson and mr joseph jobson it proved to be in great haste and as it speedily appeared in most extreme bad humour he came up to us and stopped his horse as we were about to pass with a slight salutation so sir so miss vernon ay i see well enough how it is bail put in during my absence i suppose i should like to know who drew the recognisance thats all if his worship uses this form of procedure often i advise him to get another clerk thats all for i shall certainly demit or suppose he get this present clerk stitched to his sleeve mr jobson said diana would not that do as well and pray how does farmer rutledge mr jobson i hope you found him able to sign seal and deliver this question seemed greatly to increase the wrath of the man of law he looked at miss vernon with such an air of spite and resentment as laid me under a strong temptation to knock him off his horse with the buttend of my whip which i only suppressed in consideration of his insignificance farmer rutledge maam said the clerk as soon as his indignation permitted him to articulate farmer rutledge is in as handsome enjoyment of his health as you are its all a bam maam all a bamboozle and a bite that affair of his illness and if you did not know as much before you know it now maam la you there now replied miss vernon with an affectation of extreme and simple wonder sure you dont say so mr jobson but i do say so maam rejoined the incensed scribe and moreover i say that the old miserly clodbreaker called me pettifogger pettifogger maam and said i came to hunt for a job maam which i have no more right to have said to me than any other gentleman of my profession maam especially as i am clerk to the peace having and holding said office under trigesimo septimo henrici octavi and primo gulielmi the first of king william maam of glorious and immortal memory our immortal deliverer from papists and pretenders and wooden shoes and warming pans miss vernon sad things these wooden shoes and warming pans retorted the young lady who seemed to take pleasure in augmenting his wrath and it is a comfort you dont seem to want a warming pan at present mr jobson i am afraid gaffer rutledge has not confined his incivility to language are you sure he did not give you a beating beating maam no very shortly no man alive shall beat me i promise you maam that is according as you happen to merit sir said i for your mode of speaking to this young lady is so unbecoming that if you do not change your tone i shall think it worth while to chastise you myself chastise sir and me sir do you know whom you speak to sir yes sir i replied you say yourself you are clerk of peace to the county and gaffer rutledge says you are a pettifogger and in neither capacity are you entitled to be impertinent to a young lady of fashion miss vernon laid her hand on my arm and exclaimed come mr osbaldistone i will have no assaults and battery on mr jobson i am not in sufficient charity with him to permit a single touch of your whip why he would live on it for a term at least besides you have already hurt his feelings sufficiently you have called him impertinent i dont value his language miss said the clerk somewhat crestfallen besides impertinent is not an actionable word but pettifogger is slander in the highest degree and that i will make gaffer rutledge know to his cost and all who maliciously repeat the same to the breach of the public peace and the taking away of my private good name never mind that mr jobson said miss vernon you know where there is nothing your own law allows that the king himself must lose his rights and for the taking away of your good name i pity the poor fellow who gets it and wish you joy of losing it with all my heart very well maam good evening maam i have no more to say only there are laws against papists which it would be well for the land were they better executed theres third and fourth edward vi of antiphoners missals grailes professionals manuals legends pies portuasses and those that have such trinkets in their possession miss vernon and theres summoning of papists to take the oaths and there are popish recusant convicts under the first of his present majesty ay and there are penalties for hearing mass see twentythird of queen elizabeth and third james first chapter twentyfifth and there are estates to be registered and deeds and wills to be enrolled and double taxes to be made according to the acts in that case made and provided see the new edition of the statutes at large published under the careful revision of joseph jobson gent clerk of the peace said miss vernon also and above all continued jobson for i speak to your warning you diana vernon spinstress not being a femme couverte and being a convict popish recusant are bound to repair to your own dwelling and that by the nearest way under penalty of being held felon to the king and diligently to seek for passage at common ferries and to tarry there but one ebb and flood and unless you can have it in such places to walk every day into the water up to the knees assaying to pass over a sort of protestant penance for my catholic errors i suppose said miss vernon laughing well i thank you for the information mr jobson and will hie me home as fast as i can and be a better housekeeper in time coming goodnight my dear mr jobson thou mirror of clerical courtesy goodnight maam and remember the law is not to be trifled with and we rode on our separate ways there he goes for a troublesome mischiefmaking tool said miss vernon as she gave a glance after him it is hard that persons of birth and rank and estate should be subjected to the official impertinence of such a paltry pickthank as that merely for believing as the whole world believed not much above a hundred years ago for certainly our catholic faith has the advantage of antiquity at least i was much tempted to have broken the rascals head i replied you would have acted very like a hasty young man said miss vernon and yet had my own hand been an ounce heavier than it is i think i should have laid its weight upon him well it does not signify complaining but there are three things for which i am much to be pitied if any one thought it worth while to waste any compassion upon me and what are these three things miss vernon may i ask will you promise me your deepest sympathy if i tell you certainly can you doubt it i replied closing my horse nearer to hers as i spoke with an expression of interest which i did not attempt to disguise well it is very seducing to be pitied after all so here are my three grievances in the first place i am a girl and not a young fellow and would be shut up in a madhouse if i did half the things that i have a mind to and that if i had your happy prerogative of acting as you list would make all the world mad with imitating and applauding me i cant quite afford you the sympathy you expect upon this score i replied the misfortune is so general that it belongs to one half of the species and the other half are so much better cared for that they are jealous of their prerogatives interrupted miss vernon i forgot you were a party interested nay she said as i was going to speak that soft smile is intended to be the preface of a very pretty compliment respecting the peculiar advantages which die vernons friends and kinsmen enjoy by her being born one of their helots but spare me the utterance my good friend and let us try whether we shall agree better on the second count of my indictment against fortune as that quilldriving puppy would call it i belong to an oppressed sect and antiquated religion and instead of getting credit for my devotion as is due to all good girls beside my kind friend justice inglewood may send me to the house of correction merely for worshipping god in the way of my ancestors and say as old pembroke did to the abbess of wilton when he usurped her convent and establishment go spin you jade go spin note f the abbess of wilton this is not a cureless evil said i gravely consult some of our learned divines or consult your own excellent understanding miss vernon and surely the particulars in which our religious creed differs from that in which you have been educated hush said diana placing her forefinger on her mouth hush no more of that forsake the faith of my gallant fathers i would as soon were i a man forsake their banner when the tide of battle pressed hardest against it and turn like a hireling recreant to join the victorious enemy i honour your spirit miss vernon and as to the inconveniences to which it exposes you i can only say that wounds sustained for the sake of conscience carry their own balsam with the blow ay but they are fretful and irritating for all that but i see hard of heart as you are my chance of beating hemp or drawing out flax into marvellous coarse thread affects you as little as my condemnation to coif and pinners instead of beaver and cockade so i will spare myself the fruitless pains of telling my third cause of vexation nay my dear miss vernon do not withdraw your confidence and i will promise you that the threefold sympathy due to your very unusual causes of distress shall be all duly and truly paid to account of the third providing you assure me that it is one which you neither share with all womankind nor even with every catholic in england who god bless you are still a sect more numerous than we protestants in our zeal for church and state would desire them to be it is indeed said diana with a manner greatly altered and more serious than i had yet seen her assume a misfortune that well merits compassion i am by nature as you may easily observe of a frank and unreserved disposition a plain truehearted girl who would willingly act openly and honestly by the whole world and yet fate has involved me in such a series of nets and toils and entanglements that i dare hardly speak a word for fear of consequences not to myself but to others that is indeed a misfortune miss vernon which i do most sincerely compassionate but which i should hardly have anticipated o mr osbaldistone if you but knew if any one knew what difficulty i sometimes find in hiding an aching heart with a smooth brow you would indeed pity me i do wrong perhaps in speaking to you even thus far on my own situation but you are a young man of sense and penetration you cannot but long to ask me a hundred questions on the events of this day on the share which rashleigh has in your deliverance from this petty scrape upon many other points which cannot but excite your attention and i cannot bring myself to answer with the necessary falsehood and finesse i should do it awkwardly and lose your good opinion if i have any share of it as well as my own it is best to say at once ask me no questions i have it not in my power to reply to them miss vernon spoke these words with a tone of feeling which could not but make a corresponding impression upon me i assured her she had neither to fear my urging her with impertinent questions nor my misconstruing her declining to answer those which might in themselves be reasonable or at least natural i was too much obliged i said by the interest she had taken in my affairs to misuse the opportunity her goodness had afforded me of prying into hers i only trusted and entreated that if my services could at any time be useful she would command them without doubt or hesitation thank you thank you she replied your voice does not ring the cuckoo chime of compliment but speaks like that of one who knows to what he pledges himself if but it is impossible but yet if an opportunity should occur i will ask you if you remember this promise and i assure you i shall not be angry if i find you have forgotten it for it is enough that you are sincere in your intentions just now much may occur to alter them ere i call upon you should that moment ever come to assist die vernon as if you were die vernons brother and if i were die vernons brother said i there could not be less chance that i should refuse my assistance and now i am afraid i must not ask whether rashleigh was willingly accessory to my deliverance not of me but you may ask it of himself and depend upon it he will say yes for rather than any good action should walk through the world like an unappropriated adjective in an illarranged sentence he is always willing to stand noun substantive to it himself and i must not ask whether this campbell be himself the party who eased mr morris of his portmanteau or whether the letter which our friend the attorney received was not a finesse to withdraw him from the scene of action lest he should have marred the happy event of my deliverance and i must not ask you must ask nothing of me said miss vernon so it is quite in vain to go on putting cases you are to think just as well of me as if i had answered all these queries and twenty others besides as glibly as rashleigh could have done and observe whenever i touch my chin just so it is a sign that i cannot speak upon the topic which happens to occupy your attention i must settle signals of correspondence with you because you are to be my confidant and my counsellor only you are to know nothing whatever of my affairs nothing can be more reasonable i replied laughing and the extent of your confidence will you may rely upon it only be equalled by the sagacity of my counsels this sort of conversation brought us in the highest goodhumour with each other to osbaldistone hall where we found the family far advanced in the revels of the evening get some dinner for mr osbaldistone and me in the library said miss vernon to a servant i must have some compassion upon you she added turning to me and provide against your starving in this mansion of brutal abundance otherwise i am not sure that i should show you my private haunts this same library is my den the only corner of the hallhouse where i am safe from the ourangoutangs my cousins they never venture there i suppose for fear the folios should fall down and crack their skulls for they will never affect their heads in any other way so follow me and i followed through hall and bower vaulted passage and winding stair until we reached the room where she had ordered our refreshments chapter tenth in the wide pile by others heeded not hers was one sacred solitary spot whose gloomy aisles and bending shelves contain for moral hunger food and cures for moral pain anonymous the library at osbaldistone hall was a gloomy room whose antique oaken shelves bent beneath the weight of the ponderous folios so dear to the seventeenth century from which under favour be it spoken we have distilled matter for our quartos and octavos and which once more subjected to the alembic may should our sons be yet more frivolous than ourselves be still farther reduced into duodecimos and pamphlets the collection was chiefly of the classics as well foreign as ancient history and above all divinity it was in wretched order the priests who in succession had acted as chaplains at the hall were for many years the only persons who entered its precincts until rashleighs thirst for reading had led him to disturb the venerable spiders who had muffled the fronts of the presses with their tapestry his destination for the church rendered his conduct less absurd in his fathers eyes than if any of his other descendants had betrayed so strange a propensity and sir hildebrand acquiesced in the library receiving some repairs so as to fit it for a sittingroom still an air of dilapidation as obvious as it was uncomfortable pervaded the large apartment and announced the neglect from which the knowledge which its walls contained had not been able to exempt it the tattered tapestry the wormeaten shelves the huge and clumsy yet tottering tables desks and chairs the rusty grate seldom gladdened by either seacoal or faggots intimated the contempt of the lords of osbaldistone hall for learning and for the volumes which record its treasures you think this place somewhat disconsolate i suppose said diana as i glanced my eye round the forlorn apartment but to me it seems like a little paradise for i call it my own and fear no intrusion rashleigh was joint proprietor with me while we were friends and are you no longer so was my natural question her forefinger immediately touched her dimpled chin with an arch look of prohibition we are still allies she continued bound like other confederate powers by circumstances of mutual interest but i am afraid as will happen in other cases the treaty of alliance has survived the amicable dispositions in which it had its origin at any rate we live less together and when he comes through that door there i vanish through this door here and so having made the discovery that we two were one too many for this apartment as large as it seems rashleigh whose occasions frequently call him elsewhere has generously made a cession of his rights in my favour so that i now endeavour to prosecute alone the studies in which he used formerly to be my guide and what are those studies if i may presume to ask indeed you may without the least fear of seeing my forefinger raised to my chin science and history are my principal favourites but i also study poetry and the classics and the classics do you read them in the original unquestionably rashleigh who is no contemptible scholar taught me greek and latin as well as most of the languages of to submit only muttering between his teeth ower mony maisters ower mony maisters as the paddock said to the harrow when every tooth gae her a tig apparently he found no difficulty in getting rid of supple tam and recovering possession of his former bucephalus for he accomplished the exchange without being many minutes absent nor did i hear further of his having paid any smartmoney for breach of bargain we now set forward but had not reached the top of the street in which mr jarvie dwelt when a loud hallooing and breathless call of stop stop was heard behind us we stopped accordingly and were overtaken by mr jarvies two lads who bore two parting tokens of matties care for her master the first was conveyed in the form of a voluminous silk handkerchief like the mainsail of one of his own westindiamen which mrs mattie particularly desired he would put about his neck and which thus entreated he added to his other integuments the second youngster brought only a verbal charge i thought i saw the rogue disposed to laugh as he delivered it on the part of the housekeeper that her master would take care of the waters pooh pooh silly hussy answered mr jarvie but added turning to me it shows a kind heart though it shows a kind heart in sae young a quean matties a carefu lass so speaking he pricked the sides of his palfrey and we left the town without farther interruption while we paced easily forward by a road which conducted us northeastward from the town i had an opportunity to estimate and admire the good qualities of my new friend although like my father he considered commercial transactions the most important objects of human life he was not wedded to them so as to undervalue more general knowledge on the contrary with much oddity and vulgarity of manner with a vanity which he made much more ridiculous by disguising it now and then under a thin veil of humility and devoid as he was of all the advantages of a learned education mr jarvies conversation showed tokens of a shrewd observing liberal and to the extent of its opportunities a wellimproved mind he was a good local antiquary and entertained me as we passed along with an account of remarkable events which had formerly taken place in the scenes through which we passed and as he was well acquainted with the ancient history of his district he saw with the prospective eye of an enlightened patriot the buds of many of those future advantages which have only blossomed and ripened within these few years i remarked also and with great pleasure that although a keen scotchman and abundantly zealous for the honour of his country he was disposed to think liberally of the sister kingdom when andrew fairservice whom by the way the bailie could not abide chose to impute the accident of one of the horses casting his shoe to the deteriorating influence of the union he incurred a severe rebuke from mr jarvie whisht sir whisht its illscraped tongues like yours that make mischief atween neighbourhoods and nations theres naething sae gude on this side o time but it might hae been better and that may be said o the union nane were keener against it than the glasgow folk wi their rabblings and their risings and their mobs as they ca them nowadays but its an ill wind blaws naebody gude let ilka ane roose the ford as they find it i say let glasgow flourish whilk is judiciously and elegantly putten round the towns arms by way of byword now since st mungo catched herrings in the clyde what was ever like to gar us flourish like the sugar and tobacco trade will onybody tell me that and grumble at the treaty that opened us a road westawa yonder andrew fairservice was far from acquiescing in these arguments of expedience and even ventured to enter a grumbling protest that it was an unco change to hae scotlands laws made in england and that for his share he wadna for a the herringbarrels in glasgow and a the tobaccocasks to boot hae gien up the riding o the scots parliament or sent awa our crown and our sword and our sceptre and mons meg to be keepit by thae english pockpuddings in the tower o lunnon note g mons meg what wad sir william wallace or auld davie lindsay hae said to the union or them that made it the road which we travelled while diverting the way with these discussions had become wild and open as soon as we had left glasgow a mile or two behind us and was growing more dreary as we advanced huge continuous heaths spread before behind and around us in hopeless barrenness now level and interspersed with swamps green with treacherous verdure or sable with turf or as they call them in scotland peatbogs and now swelling into huge heavy ascents which wanted the dignity and form of hills while they were still more toilsome to the passenger there were neither trees nor bushes to relieve the eye from the russet livery of absolute sterility the very heath was of that stinted imperfect kind which has little or no flower and affords the coarsest and meanest covering which as far as my experience enables me to judge mother earth is ever arrayed in living thing we saw none except occasionally a few straggling sheep of a strange diversity of colours as black bluish and orange the sable hue predominated however in their faces and legs the very birds seemed to shun these wastes and no wonder since they had an easy method of escaping from them at least i only heard the monotonous and plaintive cries of the lapwing and curlew which my companions denominated the peasweep and whaup at dinner however which we took about noon at a most miserable alehouse we had the good fortune to find that these tiresome screamers of the morass were not the only inhabitants of the moors the goodwife told us that the gudeman had been at the hill and well for us that he had been so for we enjoyed the produce of his chasse in the shape of some broiled moorgame a dish which gallantly eked out the ewemilk cheese dried salmon and oaten bread being all besides that the house afforded some very indifferent twopenny ale and a glass of excellent brandy crowned our repast and as our horses had in the meantime discussed their corn we resumed our journey with renovated vigour i had need of all the spirits a good dinner could give to resist the dejection which crept insensibly on my mind when i combined the strange uncertainty of my errand with the disconsolate aspect of the country through which it was leading me our road continued to be if possible more waste and wild than that we had travelled in the forenoon the few miserable hovels that showed some marks of human habitation were now of still rarer occurrence and at length as we began to ascend an uninterrupted swell of moorland they totally disappeared the only exercise which my imagination received was when some particular turn of the road gave us a partial view to the left of a large assemblage of darkblue mountains stretching to the north and northwest which promised to include within their recesses a country as wild perhaps but certainly differing greatly in point of interest from that which we now travelled the peaks of this screen of mountains were as wildly varied and distinguished as the hills which we had seen on the right were tame and lumpish and while i gazed on this alpine region i felt a longing to explore its recesses though accompanied with toil and danger similar to that which a sailor feels when he wishes for the risks and animation of a battle or a gale in exchange for the insupportable monotony of a protracted calm i made various inquiries of my friend mr jarvie respecting the names and positions of these remarkable mountains but it was a subject on which he had no information or did not choose to be communicative theyre the hieland hills the hieland hills yell see and hear eneugh about them before ye see glasgow cross again i downa look at them i never see them but they gar me grew its no for fear no for fear but just for grief for the puir blinded halfstarved creatures that inhabit them but say nae mair about it its ill speaking o hielandmen sae near the line i hae kend mony an honest man wadna hae ventured this length without he had made his last will and testament mattie had illwill to see me set awa on this ride and grat awee the sillie tawpie but its nae mair ferlie to see a woman greet than to see a goose gang barefit i next attempted to lead the discourse on the character and history of the person whom we were going to visit but on this topic mr jarvie was totally inaccessible owing perhaps in part to the attendance of mr andrew fairservice who chose to keep so close in our rear that his ears could not fail to catch every word which was spoken while his tongue assumed the freedom of mingling in our conversation as often as he saw an opportunity for this he occasionally incurred mr jarvies reproof keep back sir as best sets ye said the bailie as andrew pressed forward to catch the answer to some question i had asked about campbell ye wad fain ride the forehorse an ye wist how that chields aye for being out o the cheesefat he was moulded in now as for your questions mr osbaldistone now that chields out of earshot ill just tell you its free to you to speer and its free to me to answer or no gude i canna say muckle o rob puir chield ill i winna say o him for forby that hes my cousin were coming near his ain country and there may be ane o his gillies ahint every whinbush for what i ken and if yell be guided by my advice the less ye speak about him or where we are gaun or what we are gaun to do well be the mair likely to speed us in our errand for its like we may fa in wi some o his unfreends there are een ower mony o them about and his bonnet sits even on his brow yet for a that but i doubt theyll be upsides wi rob at the last air day or late day the foxs hide finds aye the flaying knife i will certainly i replied be entirely guided by your experience right mr osbaldistone right but i maun speak to this gabbling skyte too for bairns and fules speak at the cross what they hear at the ingleside dye hear you andrew whats your name fairservice andrew who at the last rebuff had fallen a good way behind did not choose to acknowledge the summons andrew ye scoundrel repeated mr jarvie here sir here here is for the dog said andrew coming up sulkily ill gie you dogs wages ye rascal if ye dinna attend to what i say tye we are gaun into the hielands a bit i judged as muckle said andrew haud your peace ye knave and hear what i have to say till ye we are gaun a bit into the hielands ye tauld me sae already replied the incorrigible andrew ill break your head said the bailie rising in wrath if ye dinna haud your tongue a hadden tongue replied andrew makes a slabbered mouth it was now necessary i should interfere which i did by commanding andrew with an authoritative tone to be silent at his peril i am silent said andrew ise do a your lawfu bidding without a naysay my puir mother used aye to tell me be it better be it worse be ruled by him that has the purse sae ye may een speak as lang as ye like baith the tane and the tither o you for andrew mr jarvie took the advantage of his stopping after quoting the above proverb to give him the requisite instructions now sir its as muckle as your lifes worth that wad be dear o little siller to be sure but it is as muckle as a our lives are worth if ye dinna mind what i sae to ye in this public whar we are gaun to and whar it is like we may hae to stay a night men o a clans and kindred hieland and lawland tak up their quarters and whiles there are mair drawn dirks than open bibles amang them when the usquebaugh gets uppermost see ye neither meddle nor mak nor gie nae offence wi that clavering tongue o yours but keep a calm sough and let ilka cock fight his ain battle muckle needs to tell me that said andrew contemptuously as if i had never seen a hielandman before and kend nae how to manage them nae man alive can cuitle up donald better than mysell i hae bought wi them sauld wi them eaten wi them drucken wi them did ye ever fight wi them said mr jarvie na na answered andrew i took care o that it wad ill hae set me that am an artist and half a scholar to my trade to be fighting amang a wheen kilted loons that dinna ken the name o a single herb or flower in braid scots let abee in the latin tongue then said mr jarvie as ye wad keep either your tongue in your mouth or your lugs in your head and ye might miss them for as saucy members as they are i charge ye to say nae word gude or bad that ye can weel get by to onybody that may be in the clachan and yell specially understand that yere no to be bleezing and blasting about your masters name and mine or saying that this is mr bailie nicol jarvie o the saut market son o the worthy deacon nicol jarvie that a body has heard about and this is mr frank osbaldistone son of the managing partner of the great house of osbaldistone and tresham in the city eneueh said answered andrew eneueh said what need ye think i wad be speaking about your names for i hae mony things o mair importance to speak about i trow its thae very things of importance that i am feared for ye blethering goose ye maunna speak ony thing gude or bad that ye can by any possibility help if ye dinna think me fit replied andrew in a huff to speak like ither folk gie me my wages and my boardwages and ise gae back to glasgow theres sma sorrow at our parting as the auld mear said to the broken cart finding andrews perverseness again rising to a point which threatened to occasion me inconvenience i was under the necessity of explaining to him that he might return if he thought proper but that in that case i would not pay him a single farthing for his past services the argument ad crumenam as it has been called by jocular logicians has weight with the greater part of mankind and andrew was in that particular far from affecting any trick of singularity he drew in his horns to use the bailies phrase on the instant professed no intention whatever to disoblige and a resolution to be guided by my commands whatever they might be concord being thus happily restored to our small party we continued to pursue our journey the road which had ascended for six or seven english miles began now to descend for about the same space through a country which neither in fertility nor interest could boast any advantage over that which we had passed already and which afforded no variety unless when some tremendous peak of a highland mountain appeared at a distance we continued however to ride on without pause and even when night fell and overshadowed the desolate wilds which we traversed we were as i understood from mr jarvie still three miles and a bittock distant from the place where we were to spend the night chapter eleventh baron of bucklivie may the foul fiend drive ye and a to pieces rive ye for building sic a town where theres neither horse meat nor mans meat nor a chair to sit down scottish popular rhymes on a bad inn the night was pleasant and the moon afforded us good light for our journey under her rays the ground over which we passed assumed a more interesting appearance than during the broad daylight which discovered the extent of its wasteness the mingled light and shadows gave it an interest which naturally did not belong to it and like the effect of a veil flung over a plain woman irritated our curiosity on a subject which had in itself nothing gratifying the descent however still continued turned winded left the more open heaths and got into steeper ravines which promised soon to lead us to the banks of some brook or river and ultimately made good their presage we found ourselves at length on the bank of a stream which rather resembled one of my native english rivers than those i had hitherto seen in scotland it was narrow deep still and silent although the imperfect light as it gleamed on its placid waters showed also that we were now among the lofty mountains which formed its cradle thats the forth said the bailie with an air of reverence which i have observed the scotch usually pay to their distinguished rivers the clyde the tweed the forth the spey are usually named by those who dwell on their banks with a sort of respect and pride and i have known duels occasioned by any word of disparagement i cannot say i have the least quarrel with this sort of harmless enthusiasm i received my friends communication with the importance which he seemed to think appertained to it in fact i was not a little pleased after so long and dull a journey to approach a region which promised to engage the imagination my faithful squire andrew did not seem to be quite of the same opinion for he received the solemn information that is the forth with a umph an he had said thats the publichouse it wad hae been mair to the purpose the forth however as far as the imperfect light permitted me to judge seemed to merit the admiration of those who claimed an interest in its stream a beautiful eminence of the most regular round shape and clothed with copsewood of hazels mountainash and dwarfoak intermixed with a few magnificent old trees which rising above the underwood exposed their forked and bared branches to the silver moonshine seemed to protect the sources from which the river sprung if i could trust the tale of my companion which while professing to disbelieve every word of it he told under his breath and with an air of something like intimidation this hill so regularly formed so richly verdant and garlanded with such a beautiful variety of ancient trees and thriving copsewood was held by the neighbourhood to contain within its unseen caverns the palaces of the fairies a race of airy beings who formed an intermediate class between men and demons and who if not positively malignant to humanity were yet to be avoided and feared on account of their capricious vindictive and irritable disposition note h fairy superstition they ca them said mr jarvie in a whisper daoine schie whilk signifies as i understand men of peace meaning thereby to make their gudewill and we may een as weel ca them that too mr osbaldistone for theres nae gude in speaking ill o the laird within his ain bounds but he added presently after on seeing one or two lights which twinkled before us its deceits o satan after a and i fearna to say it for we are near the manse now and yonder are the lights in the clachan of aberfoil i own i was well pleased at the circumstance to which mr jarvie alluded not so much that it set his tongue at liberty in his opinion with all safety to declare his real sentiments with respect to the daoine schie or fairies as that it promised some hours repose to ourselves and our horses of which after a ride of fifty miles and upwards both stood in some need we crossed the infant forth by an oldfashioned stone bridge very high and very narrow my conductor however informed me that to get through this deep and important stream and to clear all its tributary dependencies the general pass from the highlands to the southward lay by what was called the fords of frew at all times deep and difficult of passage and often altogether unfordable beneath these fords there was no pass of general resort until so far east as the bridge of stirling so that the river of forth forms a defensible line between the highlands and lowlands of scotland from its source nearly to the firth or inlet of the ocean in which it terminates the subsequent events which we witnessed led me to recall with attention what the shrewdness of bailie jarvie suggested in his proverbial expression that forth bridles the wild highlandman about half a miles riding after we crossed the bridge placed us at the door of the publichouse where we were to pass the evening it was a hovel rather worse than better than that in which we had dined but its little windows were lighted up voices were heard from within and all intimated a prospect of food and shelter to which we were by no means indifferent andrew was the first to observe that there was a peeled willowwand placed across the halfopen door of the little inn he hung back and advised us not to enter for said andrew some of their chiefs and grit men are birling at the usquebaugh in by there and dinna want to be disturbed and the least well get if we gang ramstam in on them will be a broken head to learn us better havings if we dinna come by the length of a cauld dirk in our wame whilk is just as likely i looked at the bailie who acknowledged in a whisper that the gowk had some reason for singing ance in the year meantime a staring halfclad wench or two came out of the inn and the neighbouring cottages on hearing the sound of our horses feet no one bade us welcome nor did any one offer to take our horses from which we had alighted and to our various inquiries the hopeless response of ha niel sassenach was the only answer we could extract the bailie however found in his experience a way to make them speak english if i gie ye a bawbee said he to an urchin of about ten years old with a fragment of a tattered plaid about him will you understand sassenach ay ay that will i replied the brat in very decent english then gang and tell your mammy my man theres twa sassenach gentlemen come to speak wi her the landlady presently appeared with a lighted piece of split fir blazing in her hand the turpentine in this species of torch which is generally dug from out the turfbogs makes it blaze and sparkle readily so that it is often used in the highlands in lieu of candles on this occasion such a torch illuminated the wild and anxious features of a female pale thin and rather above the usual size whose soiled and ragged dress though aided by a plaid or tartan screen barely served the purposes of decency and certainly not those of comfort her black hair which escaped in uncombed elflocks from under her coif as well as the strange and embarrassed look with which she regarded us gave me the idea of a witch disturbed in the midst of her unlawful rites she plainly refused to admit us into the house we remonstrated anxiously and pleaded the length of our journey the state of our horses and the certainty that there was not another place where we could be received nearer than callander which the bailie stated to be seven scots miles distant how many these may exactly amount to in english measurement i have never been able to ascertain but i think the double ratio may be pretty safely taken as a medium computation the obdurate hostess treated our expostulation with contempt better gang farther than fare waur she said speaking the scottish lowland dialect and being indeed a native of the lennox district her house was taen up wi them wadna like to be intruded on wi strangers she didna ken wha mair might be there redcoats it might be frae the garrison these last words she spoke under her breath and with very strong emphasis the night she said was fair abune head a night amang the heather wad caller our bloods we might sleep in our claes as mony a gude blade does in the scabbard there wasna muckle flowmoss in the shaw if we took up our quarters right and we might pit up our horses to the hill naebody wad say naething against it but my good woman said i while the bailie groaned and remained undecided it is six hours since we dined and we have not taken a morsel since i am positively dying with hunger and i have no taste for taking up my abode supperless among these mountains of yours i positively must enter and make the best apology you can to your guests for adding a stranger or two to their number andrew you will see the horses put up the hecate looked at me with surprise and then ejaculated a wilfu man will hae his way them that will to cupar maun to cupar to see thae english bellygods he has had ae fu meal the day already and hell venture life and liberty rather than hell want a het supper set roasted beef and pudding on the opposite side o the pit o tophet and an englishman will mak a spang at it but i wash my hands ot follow me sir to andrew and ise show ye where to pit the beasts i own i was somewhat dismayed at my landladys expressions which seemed to be ominous of some approaching danger i did not however choose to shrink back after having declared my resolution and accordingly i boldly entered the house and after narrowly escaping breaking my shins over a turf back and a salting tub which stood on either side of the narrow exterior passage i opened a crazy halfdecayed door constructed not of plank but of wicker and followed by the bailie entered into the principal apartment of this scottish caravansary the interior presented a view which seemed singular enough to southern eyes the fire fed with blazing turf and branches of dried wood blazed merrily in the centre but the smoke having no means to escape but through a hole in the roof eddied round the rafters of the cottage and hung in sable folds at the height of about five feet from the floor the space beneath was kept pretty clear by innumerable currents of air which rushed towards the fire from the broken panel of basketwork which served as a door from two square holes designed as ostensible windows through one of which was thrust a plaid and through the other a tattered greatcoat and moreover through various less distinguishable apertures in the walls of the tenement which being built of round stones and turf cemented by mud let in the atmosphere at innumerable crevices at an old oaken table adjoining to the fire sat three men guests apparently whom it was impossible to regard with indifference two were in the highland dress the one a little darkcomplexioned man with a lively quick and irritable expression of features wore the trews or close pantaloons wove out of a sort of chequered stocking stuff the bailie whispered me that he behoved to be a man of some consequence for that naebody but their duinhewassels wore the trews they were ill to weave exactly to their highland pleasure the other mountaineer was a very tall strong man with a quantity of reddish hair freckled face high cheekbones and long chin a sort of caricature of the national features of scotland the tartan which he wore differed from that of his companion as it had much more scarlet in it whereas the shades of black and darkgreen predominated in the chequers of the other the third who sate at the same table was in the lowland dress a bold stoutlooking man with a cast of military daring in his eye and manner his ridingdress showily and profusely laced and his cocked hat of formidable dimensions his hanger and a pair of pistols lay on the table before him each of the highlanders had their naked dirks stuck upright in the board beside him an emblem i was afterwards informed but surely a strange one that their computation was not to be interrupted by any brawl a mighty pewter measure containing about an english quart of usquebaugh a liquor nearly as strong as brandy which the highlanders distil from malt and drink undiluted in excessive quantities was placed before these worthies a broken glass with a wooden foot served as a drinking cup to the whole party and circulated with a rapidity which considering the potency of the liquor seemed absolutely marvellous these men spoke loudly and eagerly together sometimes in gaelic at other times in english another highlander wrapt in his plaid reclined on the floor his head resting on a stone from which it was only separated by a wisp of straw and slept or seemed to sleep without attending to what was going on around him he also was probably a stranger for he lay in full dress and accoutred with the sword and target the usual arms of his countrymen when on a journey cribs there were of different dimensions beside the walls formed some of fractured boards some of shattered wickerwork or plaited boughs in which slumbered the family of the house men women and children their places of repose only concealed by the dusky wreaths of vapour which arose above below and around them our entrance was made so quietly and the carousers i have described were so eagerly engaged in their discussions that we escaped their notice for a minute or two but i observed the highlander who lay beside the fire raise himself on his elbow as we entered and drawing his plaid over the lower part of his face fix his look on us for a few seconds after which he resumed his recumbent posture and seemed again to betake himself to the repose which our entrance had interrupted we advanced to the fire which was an agreeable spectacle after our late ride during the chillness of an autumn evening among the mountains and first attracted the attention of the guests who had preceded us by calling for the landlady she approached looking doubtfully and timidly now at us now at the other party and returned a hesitating and doubtful answer to our request to have something to eat she didna ken she said she wasna sure there was onything in the house and then modified her refusal with the qualification that is onything fit for the like of us i assured her we were indifferent to the quality of our supper and looking round for the means of accommodation which were not easily to be found i arranged an old hencoop as a seat for mr jarvie and turned down a broken tub to serve for my own andrew fairservice entered presently afterwards and took a place in silence behind our backs the natives as i may call them continued staring at us with an air as if confounded by our assurance and we at least i myself disguised as well as we could under an appearance of indifference any secret anxiety we might feel concerning the mode in which we were to be received by those whose privacy we had disturbed at length the lesser highlander addressing himself to me said in very good english and in a tone of great haughtiness ye make yourself at home sir i see i usually do so i replied when i come into a house of public entertainment and did she na see said the taller man by the white wand at the door that gentlemans had taken up the publichouse on their ain business i do not pretend to understand the customs of this country but i am yet to learn i replied how three persons should be entitled to exclude all other travellers from the only place of shelter and refreshment for miles round theres nae reason fort gentlemen said the bailie we mean nae offence but theres neither law nor reason fort but as far as a stoup o gude brandy wad make up the quarrel we being peaceable folk wad be willing damn your brandy sir said the lowlander adjusting his cocked hat fiercely upon his head we desire neither your brandy nor your company and up he rose from his seat his companions also arose muttering to each other drawing up their plaids and snorting and snuffing the air after the mariner of their countrymen when working themselves into a passion i tauld ye what wad come gentlemen said the landlady an ye wad hae been tauld get awa wi ye out o my house and make nae disturbance here theres nae gentleman be disturbed at jeanie macalpines an she can hinder a wheen idle english loons gaun about the country under cloud o night and disturbing honest peaceable gentlemen that are drinking their drap drink at the fireside at another time i should have thought of the old latin adage dat veniam corvis vexat censure columbas but i had not any time for classical quotation for there was obviously a fray about to ensue at which feeling myself indiginant at the inhospitable insolence with which i was treated i was totally indifferent unless on the bailies account whose person and qualities were ill qualified for such an adventure i started up however on seeing the others rise and dropped my cloak from my shoulders that i might be ready to stand on the defensive we are three to three said the lesser highlander glancing his eyes at our party if ye be pretty men draw and unsheathing his broadsword he advanced on me i put myself in a posture of defence and aware of the superiority of my weapon a rapier or smallsword was little afraid of the issue of the contest the bailie behaved with unexpected mettle as he saw the gigantic highlander confront him with his weapon drawn he tugged for a second or two at the hilt of his shabble as he called it but finding it loth to quit the sheath to which it had long been secured by rust and disuse he seized as a substitute on the redhot coulter of a plough which had been employed in arranging the fire by way of a poker and brandished it with such effect that at the first pass he set the highlanders plaid on fire and compelled him to keep a respectful distance till he could get it extinguished andrew on the contrary who ought to have faced the lowland champion had i grieve to say it vanished at the very commencement of the fray but his antagonist crying fair play fair play seemed courteously disposed to take no share in the scuffle thus we commenced our rencontre on fair terms as to numbers my own aim was to possess myself if possible of my antagonists weapon but i was deterred from closing for fear of the dirk which he held in his left hand and used in parrying the thrusts of my rapier meantime the bailie notwithstanding the success of his first onset was sorely bested the weight of his weapon the corpulence of his person the very effervescence of his own passions were rapidly exhausting both his strength and his breath and he was almost at the mercy of his antagonist when up started the sleeping highlander from the floor on which he reclined with his naked sword and target in his hand and threw himself between the discomfited magistrate and his assailant exclaiming her nainsell has eaten the town pread at the cross o glasgow and py her troth shell fight for bailie sharvie at the clachan of aberfoil tat will she een and seconding his words with deeds this unexpected auxiliary made his sword whistle about the ears of his tall countryman who nothing abashed returned his blows with interest but being both accoutred with round targets made of wood studded with brass and covered with leather with which they readily parried each others strokes their combat was attended with much more noise and clatter than serious risk of damage it appeared indeed that there was more of bravado than of serious attempt to do us any injury for the lowland gentleman who as i mentioned had stood aside for want of an antagonist when the brawl commenced was now pleased to act the part of moderator and peacemaker illustration fray at jeannie macalpines hand your hands haud your hands eneugh done eneugh done the quarrels no mortal the strange gentlemen have shown themselves men of honour and gien reasonable satisfaction ill stand on mine honour as kittle as ony man but i hate unnecessary bloodshed it was not of course my wish to protract the fray my adversary seemed equally disposed to sheathe his sword the bailie gasping for breath might be considered as hors de combat and our two swordandbuckler men gave up their contest with as much indifference as they had entered into it and now said the worthy gentleman who acted as umpire let us drink and gree like honest fellows the house will haud us a i propose that this good little gentleman that seems sair forfoughen as i may say in this tuilzie shall send for a tass o brandy and ill pay for another by way of archilowe and then well birl our bawbees a round about like brethren and fas to pay my new ponnie plaid said the larger highlander wi a hole burnt int ane might put a kailpat through saw ever onybody a decent gentleman fight wi a firebrand before let that be nae hinderance said the bailie who had now recovered his breath and was at once disposed to enjoy the triumph of having behaved with spirit and avoid the necessity of again resorting to such hard and doubtful arbitrament gin i hae broken the head he said i sall find the plaister a new plaid sall ye hae and o the best your ain clancolours man an ye will tell me where it can be sent tye frae glasco i needna name my clan i am of a kings clan as is weel kend said the highlander but ye may tak a bit o the plaid figh she smells like a singit sheeps head and thatll learn ye the sett and a gentleman thats a cousin o my ain that carries eggs doun frae glencroe will ca fort about martimas an ye will tell her where ye bide but honest gentleman neist time ye fight an ye hae ony respect for your athversary let it be wi your sword man since ye wear ane and no wi thae het culters and fireprands like a wild indian conscience replied the bailie every man maun do as he dow my sword hasna seen the light since bothwell brigg when my father thats dead and gane ware it and i kenna weel if it was forthcoming then either for the battle was o the briefest at ony rate its glued to the scabbard now beyond my power to part them and finding that i een grippit at the first thing i could make a fend wi i trow my fighting days is done though i like ill to take the scorn for a that but wheres the honest lad that tuik my quarrel on himself sae frankly ise bestow a gill o aquavitae on him an i suld never ca for anither archilowe of unknown derivation signifies a peaceoffering the champion for whom he looked around was however no longer to be seen he had escaped unobserved by the bailie immediately when the brawl was ended yet not before i had recognised in his wild features and shaggy red hair our acquaintance dougal the fugitive turnkey of the glasgow jail i communicated this observation in a whisper to the bailie who answered in the same tone weel weel i see that him that ye ken o said very right there is some glimmering o common sense about that creature dougal i maun see and think o something will do him some gude thus saying he sat down and fetching one or two deep aspirations by way of recovering his breath called to the landlady i think luckie now that i find that theres nae hole in my wame whilk i had muckle reason to doubt frae the doings o your house i wad be the better o something to pit intillt the dame who was all officiousness so soon as the storm had blown over immediately undertook to broil something comfortable for our supper indeed nothing surprised me more in the course of the whole matter than the extreme calmness with which she and her household seemed to regard the martial tumult that had taken place the good woman was only heard to call to some of her assistants steek the door steek the door kill or be killed let naebody pass out till they hae paid the lawin and as for the slumberers in those lairs by the wall which served the family for beds they only raised their shirtless bodies to look at the fray ejaculated oigh oigh in the tone suitable to their respective sex and ages and were i believe fast asleep again ere our swords were well returned to their scabbards our landlady however now made a great bustle to get some victuals ready and to my surprise very soon began to prepare for us in the fryingpan a savoury mess of venison collops which she dressed in a manner that might well satisfy hungry men if not epicures in the meantime the brandy was placed on the table to which the highlanders however partial to their native strong waters showed no objection but much the contrary and the lowland gentleman after the first cup had passed round became desirous to know our profession and the object of our journey we are bits o glasgow bodies if it please your honour said the bailie with an affectation of great humility travelling to stirling to get in some siller that is awing us i was so silly as to feel a little disconcerted at the unassuming account which he chose to give of us but i recollected my promise to be silent and allow the bailie to manage the matter his own way and really when i recollected will that i had not only brought the honest man a long journey from home which even in itself had been some inconvenience if i were to judge from the obvious pain and reluctance with which he took his seat or arose from it but had also put him within a hairsbreadth of the loss of his life i could hardly refuse him such a compliment the spokesman of the other party snuffing up his breath through his nose repeated the words with a sort of sneer you glasgow tradesfolks hae naething to do but to gang frae the tae end o the west o scotland to the ither to plague honest folks that may chance to be awee ahint the hand like me if our debtors were a sic honest gentlemen as i believe you to be garschattachin replied the bailie conscience we might save ourselves a labour for they wad come to seek us eh what how exclaimed the person whom he had addressed as i shall live by bread not forgetting beef and brandy its my auld friend nicol jarvie the best man that ever counted doun merks on a band till a distressed gentleman were ye na coming up my way were ye na coming up the endrick to garschattachin troth no maister galbraith replied the bailie i had other eggs on the spit and i thought ye wad be saying i cam to look about the annual rent thats due on the bit heritable band thats between us damn the annual rent said the laird with an appearance of great heartiness deil a word o business will you or i speak now that yere so near my country to see how a trotcosey and a joseph can disguise a man that i suldna ken my auld feal friend the deacon the bailie if ye please resumed my companion but i ken what gars ye mistak the band was granted to my father thats happy and he was deacon but his name was nicol as weel as mine i dinna mind that theres been a payment of principal sum or annual rent on it in my day and doubtless that has made the mistake weel the devil take the mistake and all that occasioned it replied mr galbraith but i am glad ye are a bailie gentlemen fill a brimmer this is my excellent friend bailie nicol jarvies health i kend him and his father these twenty years are ye a cleared kelty aff fill anither heres to his being sune provost i say provost lord provost nicol jarvie and them that affirms theres a man walks the hiestreet o glasgow thats fitter for the office they will do weel not to let me duncan galbraith of garschattachin hear them say sae thats all and therewith duncan galbraith martially cocked his hat and placed it on one side of his head with an air of defiance the brandy was probably the best recommendation of there complimentary toasts to the two highlanders who drank them without appearing anxious to comprehend their purport they commenced a conversation with mr galbraith in gaelic which he talked with perfect fluency being as i afterwards learned a near neighbour to the highlands i kend that scantograce weel eneugh frae the very outset said the bailie in a whisper to me but when blude was warm and swords were out at ony rate wha kens what way he might hae thought o paying his debts it will be lang or he does it in common form but hes an honest lad and has a warm heart too he disna come often to the cross o glasgow but mony a buck and blackcock he sends us doun frae the hills and i can want my siller weel eneugh my father the deacon had a great regard for the family of garschattachin supper being now nearly ready i looked round for andrew fairservice but that trusty follower had not been seen by any one since the beginning of the rencontre the hostess however said that she believed our servant had gone into the stable and offered to light me to the place saying that no entreaties of the bairns or hers could make him give any answer and that truly she caredna to gang into the stable herself at this hour she was a lone woman and it was weel kend how the brownie of benyegask guided the gudewife of ardnagowan and it was aye judged there was a brownie in our stable which was just what garrd me gie ower keeping an hostler as however she lighted me towards the miserable hovel into which they had crammed our unlucky steeds to regale themselves on hay every fibre of which was as thick as an ordinary goosequill she plainly showed me that she had another reason for drawing me aside from the company than that which her words implied read that she said slipping a piece of paper into my hand as we arrived at the door of the shed i bless god i am rid ot between sogers and saxons and caterans and cattlelifters and hership and bluidshed an honest woman wad live quieter in hell than on the hieland line so saying she put the pinetorch into my hand and returned into the house chapter twelfth bagpipes not lyres the highland hills adorn macleans loud hollo and macgregors horn john coopers reply to allan ramsay i stopped in the entrance of the stable if indeed a place be entitled to that name where horses were stowed away along with goats poultry pigs and cows under the same roof with the mansionhouse although by a degree of refinement unknown to the rest of the hamlet and which i afterwards heard was imputed to an overpride on the part of jeanie macalpine our landlady the apartment was accommodated with an entrance different from that used by her biped customers by the light of my torch i deciphered the following billet written on a wet crumpled and dirty piece of paper and addressed for the honoured hands of mr f o a saxon young gentleman these the contents were as follows sir there are nighthawks abroad so that i cannot give you and my respected kinsman b n j the meeting at the clachan of aberfoil whilk was my purpose i pray you to avoid unnecessary communication with those you may find there as it may give future trouble the person who gives you this is faithful and may be trusted and will guide you to a place where god willing i may safely give you the meeting when i trust my kinsman and you will visit my poor house where in despite of my enemies i can still promise sic cheer as ane hielandman may gie his friends and where we will drink a solemn health to a certain d v and look to certain affairs whilk i hope to be your aidance in and i rest as is wont among gentlemen your servant to command r m c i was a good deal mortified at the purport of this letter which seemed to adjourn to a more distant place and date the service which i had hoped to receive from this man campbell still however it was some comfort to know that he continued to be in my interest since without him i could have no hope of recovering my fathers papers i resolved therefore to obey his instructions and observing all caution before the guests to take the first good opportunity i could find to procure from the landlady directions how i was to obtain a meeting with this mysterious person my next business was to seek out andrew fairservice whom i called several times by name without receiving any answer surveying the stable all round at the same time not without risk of setting the premises on fire had not the quantity of wet litter and mud so greatly counterbalanced two or three bunches of straw and hay at length my repeated cries of andrew fairservice andrew fool ass where are you produced a doleful here in a groaning tone which might have been that of the brownie itself guided by this sound i advanced to the corner of a shed where ensconced in the angle of the wall behind a barrel full of the feathers of all the fowls which had died in the cause of the public for a month past i found the manful andrew and partly by force partly by command and exhortation compelled him forth into the open air the first words he spoke were i am an honest lad sir who the devil questions your honesty said i or what have we to do with it at present i desire you to come and attend us at supper yes reiterated andrew without apparently understanding what i said to him i am an honest lad whatever the bailie may say to the contrary i grant the warld and the warlds gear sits ower near my heart whiles as it does to mony a ane but i am an honest lad and though i spak o leaving ye in the muir yet god knows it was far frae my purpose but just like idle things folk says when theyre driving a bargain to get it as far to their ain side as they can and i like your honour weel for sae young a lad and i wadna part wi ye lightly what the deuce are you driving at now i replied has not everything been settled again and again to your satisfaction and are you to talk of leaving me every hour without either rhyme or reason ay but i was only making fashion before replied andrew but its come on me in sair earnest now lose or win i daur gae nae farther wi your honour and if yell tak my foolish advice yell bide by a broken tryste rather than gang forward yoursell i hae a sincere regard for ye and im sure yell be a credit to your friends if ye live to saw out your wild aits and get some mair sense and steadiness but i can follow ye nae farther even if ye suld founder and perish from the way for lack of guidance and counsel to gang into rob roys country is a mere tempting o providence rob roy said i in some surprise i know no such person what new trick is this andrew its hard said andrew very hard that a man canna be believed when he speaks heavens truth just because hes whiles owercome and tells lees a little when there is necessary occasion ye needna ask whae rob roy is the reiving lifter that he is god forgie me i hope naebody hears us when ye hae a letter frae him in your pouch i heard ane o his gillies bid that auld rudas jaud of a gudewife gie ye that they thought i didna understand their gibberish but though i canna speak it muckle i can gie a gude guess at what i hear them say i never thought to hae tauld ye that but in a fright a things come out that suld be keepit in o maister frank a your uncles follies and a your cousins pliskies were naething to this drink clean cap out like sir hildebrand begin the blessed morning with brandy sops like squire percy swagger like squire thorncliff rin wud amang the lasses like squire john gamble like richard win souls to the pope and the deevil like rashleigh rive rant break the sabbath and do the popes bidding like them a put thegither but merciful providence take care o your young bluid and gang nae near rob roy andrews alarm was too sincere to permit me to suppose he counterfeited i contented myself however with telling him that i meant to remain in the alehouse that night and desired to have the horses well looked after as to the rest i charged him to observe the strictest silence upon the subject of his alarm and he might rely upon it i would not incur any serious danger without due precaution he followed me with a dejected air into the house observing between his teeth man suld be served afore beast i haena had a morsel in my mouth but the rough legs o that auld muircock this haill blessed day the harmony of the company seemed to have suffered some interruption since my departure for i found mr galbraith and my friend the bailie high in dispute ill hear nae sic language said mr jarvie as i entered respecting the duke o argyle and the name o campbell hes a worthy publicspirited nobleman and a credit to the country and a friend and benefactor to the trade o glasgow ill sae naething against maccallum more and the sliochnandiarmid said the lesser highlander laughing i live on the wrang side of glencroe to quarrel with inverara our loch neer saw the cawmil lymphads said the bigger highlander lymphads the galley which the family of argyle and others of the clan campbell carry in their arms shell speak her mind and fear naebody she doesna value a cawmil mair as a cowan and ye may tell maccallum more that allan iverach said sae its a far cry to lochow lochow and the adjacent districts formed the original seat of the campbells the expression of a far cry to lochow was proverbial mr galbraith on whom the repeated pledges which he had quaffed had produced some influence slapped his hand on the table with great force and said in a stern voice theres a bloody debt due by that family and they will pay it one day the banes of a loyal and a gallant grahame hae lang rattled in their coffin for vengeance on thae dukes of guile and lords for lorn there neer was treason in scotland but a cawmil was at the bottom ot and now that the wrang sides uppermost wha but the cawmils for keeping down the right but this warld winna last lang and it will be time to sharp the maiden for shearing o craigs and thrapples i hope to see the auld rusty lass linking at a bluidy harst again a rude kind of guillotine formerly used in scotland for shame garschattachin exclaimed the bailie fy for shame sir wad ye say sic things before a magistrate and bring yoursell into trouble how dye think to mainteen your family and satisfy your creditors mysell and others if ye gang on in that wild way which cannot but bring you under the law to the prejudice of a thats connected wi ye d n my creditors retorted the gallant galbraith and you if ye be ane o them i say there will be a new warld sune and we shall hae nae cawmils cocking their bonnet sae hie and hounding their dogs where they daurna come themsells nor protecting thieves nor murderers and oppressors to harry and spoil better men and mair loyal clans than themsells the bailie had a great mind to have continued the dispute when the savoury vapour of the broiled venison which our landlady now placed before us proved so powerful a mediator that he betook himself to his trencher with great eagerness leaving the strangers to carry on the dispute among themselves and tats true said the taller highlander whose name i found was stewart for we suldna be plagued and worried here wi meetings to pit down rob roy if the cawmils didna gie him refutch i was ane o thirty o my ain name part glenfinlas and part men that came down frae appine we shased the macgregors as ye wad shase raedeer till we came into glenfallochs country and the cawmils raise and wadna let us pursue nae farder and sae we lost our labour but her wad gie twa and a plack to be as near rob as she was tat day it seemed to happen very unfortunately that in every topic of discourse which these warlike gentlemen introduced my friend the bailie found some matter of offence yell forgie me speaking my mind sir but ye wad maybe hae gien the best bowl in your bonnet to hae been as far awae frae rob as ye are een now od my het pleughculter wad hae been naething to his claymore she had better speak nae mair about her culter or by g her will gar her eat her words and twa handfuls o cauld steel to drive them ower wi and with a most inauspicious and menacing look the mountaineer laid his hand on his dagger well hae nae quarrelling allan said his shorter companion and if the glasgow gentleman has ony regard for rob roy hell maybe see him in cauld irons the night and playing tricks on a tow the morn for this country has been owre lang plagued wi him and his race is nearhand run and its time allan we were ganging to our lads hout awa inverashalloch said galbraith mind the auld saw man its a bauld moon quoth bennygask another pint quoth lesley well no start for another chappin i hae had chappins eneugh said inverashalloch ill drink my quart of usquebaugh or brandy wi ony honest fellow but the deil a drap mair when i hae wark to do in the morning and in my puir thinking garschattachin ye had better be thinking to bring up your horsemen to the clachan before day that we may ay start fair what the deevil are ye in sic a hurry for said garschattachin meat and mass never hindered wark an it had been my directing deil a bit o me wad hae fashed ye to come down the glens to help us the garrison and our ain horse could hae taen rob roy easily enough theres the hand he said holding up his own should lay him on the green and never ask a hielandman o ye a for his help ye might hae loot us bide still where we were then said inverashalloch i didna come sixty miles without being sent for but an yell hae my opinion i redd ye keep your mouth better steekit if ye hope to speed shored folk live lang and sae may him ye ken o the way to catch a bird is no to fling your bannet at her and also thae gentlemen hae heard some things they suldna hae heard an the brandy hadna been ower bauld for your brain major galbraith ye needna cock your hat and bully wi me man for i will not bear it i hae said it said galbraith with a solemn air of drunken gravity that i will quarrel no more this night either with broadcloth or tartan when i am off duty ill quarrel with you or ony man in the hielands or lowlands but not on duty no no i wish we heard o these redcoats if it had been to do onything against king james we wad hae seen them lang syne but when its to keep the peace o the country they can lie as lound as their neighbours as he spoke we heard the measured footsteps of a body of infantry on the march and an officer followed by two or three files of soldiers entered the apartment he spoke in an english accent which was very pleasant to my ears now so long accustomed to the varying brogue of the highland and lowland scotch you are i suppose major galbraith of the squadron of lennox militia and these are the two highland gentlemen with whom i was appointed to meet in this place they assented and invited the officer to take some refreshments which he declined i have been too late gentlemen and am desirous to make up time i have orders to search for and arrest two persons guilty of treasonable practices well wash our hands o that said inverashalloch i came here wi my men to fight against the red macgregor that killed my cousin seven times removed duncan maclaren in invernenty but i will hae nothing to do touching honest gentlemen that may be gaun through the country on their ain business this as appears from the introductory matter to this tale is an anachronism the slaughter of maclaren a retainer of the chief of appine by the macgregors did not take place till after rob roys death since it happened in nor i neither said iverach major galbraith took up the matter more solemnly and premising his oration with a hiccup spoke to the following purpose i shall say nothing against king george captain because as it happens my commission may rin in his name but one commission being good sir does not make another bad and some think that james may be just as good a name as george theres the king that is and theres the king that suld of right be i say an honest man may and suld be loyal to them both captain but i am of the lord lieutenants opinion for the time as it becomes a militia officer and a deputelieutenant and about treason and all that its lost time to speak of it least said is sunest mended i am sorry to see how you have been employing your time sir replied the english officer as indeed the honest gentlemans reasoning had a strong relish of the liquor he had been drinking and i could wish sir it had been otherwise on an occasion of this consequence i would recommend to you to try to sleep for an hour do these gentlemen belong to your party looking at the bailie and me who engaged in eating our supper had paid little attention to the officer on his entrance travellers sir said galbraith lawful travellers by sea and land as the prayerbook hath it my instructions said the captain taking a light to survey us closer are to place under arrest an elderly and a young person and i think these gentlemen answer nearly the description take care what you say sir said mr jarvie it shall not be your red coat nor your laced hat shall protect you if you put any affront on me ise convene ye baith in an action of scandal and false imprisonment i am a free burgess and a magistrate o glasgow nicol jarvie is my name sae was my fathers afore me i am a bailie be praised for the honour and my father was a deacon he was a prickeared cur said major galbraith and fought agane the king at bothwell brigg he paid what he ought and what he bought mr galbraith said the bailie and was an honester man than ever stude on your shanks i have no time to attend to all this said the officer i must positively detain you gentlemen unless you can produce some respectable security that you are loyal subjects i desire to be carried before some civil magistrate said the bailie the sherra or the judge of the bounds i am not obliged to answer every redcoat that speers questions at me well sir i shall know how to manage you if you are silent and you sir to me what may your name be francis osbaldistone sir what a son of sir hildebrand osbaldistone of northumberland no sir interrupted the bailie a son of the great william osbaldistone of the house of osbaldistone and tresham cranealley london i am afraid sir said the officer your name only increases the suspicions against you and lays me under the necessity of requesting that you will give up what papers you have in charge i observed the highlanders look anxiously at each other when this proposal was made i had none i replied to surrender the officer commanded me to be disarmed and searched to have resisted would have been madness i accordingly gave up my arms and submitted to a search which was conducted as civilly as an operation of the kind well could they found nothing except the note which i had received that night through the hand of the landlady this is different from what i expected said the officer but it affords us good grounds for detaining you here i find you in written communication with the outlawed robber robert macgregor campbell who has been so long the plague of this district how do you account for that spies of rob said inverashalloch we wad serve them right to strap them up till the neist tree we are gaun to see after some gear o our ain gentlemen said the bailie thats faen into his hands by accident theres nae law agane a man looking after his ain i hope how did you come by this letter said the officer addressing himself to me i could not think of betraying the poor woman who had given it to me and remained silent do you know anything of it fellow said the officer looking at andrew whose jaws were chattering like a pair of castanets at the threats thrown out by the highlander o ay i ken a about it it was a hieland loon gied the letter to that langtongued jaud the gudewife there ill be sworn my maister kend naething about it but hes wilfu to gang up the hills and speak wi rob and oh sir it wad be a charity just to send a wheen o your redcoats to see him safe back to glasgow again whether he will or no and ye can keep mr jarvie as lang as ye like hes responsible enough for ony fine ye may lay on him and sos my master for that matter for me im just a puir gardener lad and no worth your steering i believe said the officer the best thing i can do is to send these persons to the garrison under an escort they seem to be in immediate correspondence with the enemy and i shall be in no respect answerable for suffering them to be at liberty gentlemen you will consider yourselves as my prisoners so soon as dawn approaches i will send you to a place of security if you be the persons you describe yourselves it will soon appear and you will sustain no great inconvenience from being detained a day or two i can hear no remonstrances he continued turning away from the bailie whose mouth was open to address him the service i am on gives me no time for idle discussions aweel aweel sir said the bailie youre welcome to a tune on your ain fiddle but see if i dinna gar ye dance tillt afore as dune an anxious consultation now took place between the officer and the highlanders but carried on in so low a tone that it was impossible to catch the sense so soon as it was concluded they all left the house at their departure the bailie thus expressed himself thae hielandmen are o the westland

face see if one fear one shadow of a terror one paleness dare appear but from my anger to lay hold on your mercies bonduca we were permitted to slumber out the remainder of the night in the best manner that the miserable accommodations of the alehouse permitted the bailie fatigued with his journey and the subsequent scenes less interested also in the event of our arrest which to him could only be a matter of temporary inconvenience perhaps less nice than habit had rendered me about the cleanliness or decency of his couch tumbled himself into one of the cribs which i have already described and soon was heard to snore soundly a broken sleep snatched by intervals while i rested my head upon the table was my only refreshment in the course of the night i had occasion to observe that there seemed to be some doubt and hesitation in the motions of the soldiery men were sent out as if to obtain intelligence and returned apparently without bringing any satisfactory information to their commanding officer he was obviously eager and anxious and again despatched small parties of two or three men some of whom as i could understand from what the others whispered to each other did not return again to the clachan the morning had broken when a corporal and two men rushed into the hut dragging after them in a sort of triumph a highlander whom i immediately recognised as my acquaintance the exturnkey the bailie who started up at the noise with which they entered immediately made the same discovery and exclaimed mercy on us they hae grippit the puir creature dougal captain i will put in bail sufficient bail for that dougal creature to this offer dictated undoubtedly by a grateful recollection of the late interference of the highlander in his behalf the captain only answered by requesting mr jarvie to mind his own affairs and remember that he was himself for the present a prisoner i take you to witness mr osbaldistone said the bailie who was probably better acquainted with the process in civil than in military cases that he has refused sufficient bail its my opinion that the creature dougal will have a good action of wrongous imprisonment and damages agane him under the act seventeen hundred and one and ill see the creature righted the officer whose name i understood was thornton paying no attention to the bailies threats or expostulations instituted a very close inquiry into dougals life and conversation and compelled him to admit though with apparent reluctance the successive facts that he knew rob roy macgregor that he had seen him within these twelve months within these six months within this month within this week in fine that he had parted from him only an hour ago all this detail came like drops of blood from the prisoner and was to all appearance only extorted by the threat of a halter and the next tree which captain thornton assured him should be his doom if he did not give direct and special information and now my friend said the officer you will please inform me how many men your master has with him at present dougal looked in every direction except at the querist and began to answer she canna just be sure about that look at me you highland dog said the officer and remember your life depends on your answer how many rogues had that outlawed scoundrel with him when you left him ou no aboon sax rogues when i was gane and where are the rest of his banditti gane wi the lieutenant agane ta westland carles against the westland clans said the captain umph that is likely enough and what rogues errand were you despatched upon just to see what your honour and ta gentlemen redcoats were doing doun here at ta clachan the creature will prove fausehearted after a said the bailie who by this time had planted himself close behind me its lucky i didna pit mysell to expenses anent him and now my friend said the captain let us understand each other you have confessed yourself a spy and should string up to the next tree but come if you will do me one good turn i will do you another you donald you shall just in the way of kindness carry me and a small party to the place where you left your master as i wish to speak a few words with him on serious affairs and ill let you go about your business and give you five guineas to boot oigh oigh exclaimed dougal in the extremity of distress and perplexity she canna do tat she canna do tat shell rather be hanged hanged then you shall be my friend said the officer and your blood be upon your own head corporal cramp do you play provostmarshal away with him the corporal had confronted poor dougal for some time ostentatiously twisting a piece of cord which he had found in the house into the form of a halter he now threw it about the culprits neck and with the assistance of two soldiers had dragged dougal as far as the door when overcome with the terror of immediate death he exclaimed shentlemans stops stops shell do his honours bidding stops awa wi the creature said the bailie he deserves hanging mair now than ever awa wi him corporal why dinna ye tak him awa its my belief and opinion honest gentleman said the corporal that if you were going to be hanged yourself you would be in no such d d hurry this bydialogue prevented my hearing what passed between the prisoner and captain thornton but i heard the former snivel out in a very subdued tone and yell ask her to gang nae farther than just to show ye where the macgregor is ohon ohon silence your howling you rascal no i give you my word i will ask you to go no farther corporal make the men fall in in front of the houses get out these gentlemens horses we must carry them with us i cannot spare any men to guard them here come my lads get under arms the soldiers bustled about and were ready to move we were led out along with dougal in the capacity of prisoners as we left the hut i heard our companion in captivity remind the captain of ta foive kuineas here they are for you said the officer putting gold into his hand but observe that if you attempt to mislead me i will blow your brains out with my own hand the creature said the bailie is waur than i judged him it is a warldly and a perfidious creature o the filthy lucre of gain that men gies themsells up to my father the deacon used to say the penny siller slew mair souls than the naked sword slew bodies the landlady now approached and demanded payment of her reckoning including all that had been quaffed by major galbraith and his highland friends the english officer remonstrated but mrs macalpine declared if she hadna trusted to his honours name being used in their company she wad never hae drawn them a stoup o liquor for mr galbraith she might see him again or she might no but weel did she wot she had sma chance of seeing her siller and she was a puir widow had naething but her custom to rely on captain thornton put a stop to her remonstrances by paying the charge which was only a few english shillings though the amount sounded very formidable in scottish denominations the generous officer would have included mr jarvie and me in this general acquittance but the bailie disregarding an intimation from the landlady to make as muckle of the inglishers as we could for they were sure to gie us plague eneugh went into a formal accounting respecting our share of the reckoning and paid it accordingly the captain took the opportunity to make us some slight apology for detaining us if we were loyal and peaceable subjects he said we would not regret being stopt for a day when it was essential to the kings service if otherwise he was acting according to his duty we were compelled to accept an apology which it would have served no purpose to refuse and we sallied out to attend him on his march i shall never forget the delightful sensation with which i exchanged the dark smoky smothering atmosphere of the highland hut in which we had passed the night so uncomfortably for the refreshing fragrance of the morning air and the glorious beams of the rising sun which from a tabernacle of purple and golden clouds were darted full on such a scene of natural romance and beauty as had never before greeted my eyes to the left lay the valley down which the forth wandered on its easterly course surrounding the beautiful detached hill with all its garland of woods on the right amid a profusion of thickets knolls and crags lay the bed of a broad mountain lake lightly curled into tiny waves by the breath of the morning breeze each glittering in its course under the influence of the sunbeams high hills rocks and banks waving with natural forests of birch and oak formed the borders of this enchanting sheet of water and as their leaves rustled to the wind and twinkled in the sun gave to the depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity man alone seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority in a scene where all the ordinary features of nature were raised and exalted the miserable little bourocks as the bailie termed them of which about a dozen formed the village called the clachan of aberfoil were composed of loose stones cemented by clay instead of mortar and thatched by turfs laid rudely upon rafters formed of native and unhewn birches and oaks from the woods around the roofs approached the ground so nearly that andrew fairservice observed we might have ridden over the village the night before and never found out we were near it unless our horses feet had gane through the riggin from all we could see mrs macalpines house miserable as were the quarters it afforded was still by far the best in the hamlet and i dare say if my description gives you any curiosity to see it you will hardly find it much improved at the present day for the scotch are not a people who speedily admit innovation even when it comes in the shape of improvement note i clachan of aberfoil the inhabitants of these miserable dwellings were disturbed by the noise of our departure and as our party of about twenty soldiers drew up in rank before marching off we were reconnoitred by many a beldam from the halfopened door of her cottage as these sibyls thrust forth their grey heads imperfectly covered with close caps of flannel and showed their shrivelled brows and long skinny arms with various gestures shrugs and muttered expressions in gaelic addressed to each other my imagination recurred to the witches of macbeth and i imagined i read in the features of these crones the malevolence of the weird sisters the little children also who began to crawl forth some quite naked and others very imperfectly covered with tatters of tartan stuff clapped their tiny hands and grinned at the english soldiers with an expression of national hate and malignity which seemed beyond their years i remarked particularly that there were no men nor so much as a boy of ten or twelve years old to be seen among the inhabitants of a village which seemed populous in proportion to its extent and the idea certainly occurred to me that we were likely to receive from them in the course of our journey more effectual tokens of illwill than those which lowered on the visages and dictated the murmurs of the women and children it was not until we commenced our march that the malignity of the elder persons of the community broke forth into expressions the last file of men had left the village to pursue a small broken track formed by the sledges in which the natives transported their peats and turfs and which led through the woods that fringed the lower end of the lake when a shrilly sound of female exclamation broke forth mixed with the screams of children the whooping of boys and the clapping of hands with which the highland dames enforce their notes whether of rage or lamentation i asked andrew who looked as pale as death what all this meant i doubt well ken that ower sune said he means it means that the highland wives are cursing and banning the redcoats and wishing illluck to them and ilka ane that ever spoke the saxon tongue i have heard wives flyte in england and scotland its nae marvel to hear them flyte ony gate but sic illscrapit tongues as thae highland carlines and sic grewsome wishes that men should be slaughtered like sheep and that they may lapper their hands to the elbows in their hearts blude and that they suld dee the death of walter cuming of guiyock wha hadna as muckle o him left thegither as would supper a messandog sic awsome language as that i neer heard out o a human thrapple and unless the deil wad rise amang them to gie them a lesson i thinkna that their talent at cursing could be amended a great feudal oppressor who riding on some cruel purpose through the forest of guiyock was thrown from his horse and his foot being caught in the stirrup was dragged along by the frightened animal till he was torn to pieces the expression walter of guiyocks curse is proverbial the warst ot is they bid us aye gang up the loch and see what well land in adding andrews information to what i had myself observed i could scarce doubt that some attack was meditated upon our party the road as we advanced seemed to afford every facility for such an unpleasant interruption at first it winded apart from the lake through marshy meadow ground overgrown with copsewood now traversing dark and close thickets which would have admitted an ambuscade to be sheltered within a few yards of our line of march and frequently crossing rough mountain torrents some of which took the soldiers up to the knees and ran with such violence that their force could only be stemmed by the strength of two or three men holding fast by each others arms it certainly appeared to me though altogether unacquainted with military affairs that a sort of halfsavage warriors as i had heard the highlanders asserted to be might in such passes as these attack a party of regular forces with great advantage the bailies good sense and shrewd observation had led him to the same conclusion as i understood from his requesting to speak with the captain whom he addressed nearly in the following terms captain its no to fleech ony favour out o ye for i scorn it and its under protest that i reserve my action and pleas of oppression and wrongous imprisonment but being a friend to king george and his army i take the liberty to speer dinna ye think ye might tak a better time to gang up this glen if ye are seeking rob roy hes kend to be better than half a hunder men strong when hes at the fewest an if he brings in the glengyle folk and the glenfinlas and balquhidder lads he may come to gie you your kail through the reek and its my sincere advice as a kings friend ye had better tak back again to the clachan for thae women at aberfoil are like the scarts and seamaws at the cumries theres aye foul weather follows their skirting make yourself easy sir replied captain thornton i am in the execution of my orders and as you say you are a friend to king george you will be glad to learn that it is impossible that this gang of ruffians whose license has disturbed the country so long can escape the measures now taken to suppress them the horse squadron of militia commanded by major galbraith is already joined by two or more troops of cavalry which will occupy all the lower passes of this wild country three hundred highlanders under the two gentlemen you saw at the inn are in possession of the upper part and various strong parties from the garrison are securing the hills and glens in different directions our last accounts of rob roy correspond with what this fellow has confessed that finding himself surrounded on all sides he had dismissed the greater part of his followers with the purpose either of lying concealed or of making his escape through his superior knowledge of the passes i dinna ken said the bailie theres mair brandy than brains in garschattachins head this morning and i wadna an i were you captain rest my main dependence on the hielandmen hawks winna pike out hawks een they may quarrel among themsells and gie ilk ither ill names and maybe a slash wi a claymore but they are sure to join in the lang run against a civilised folk that wear breeks on their hinder ends and hae purses in their pouches apparently these admonitions were not altogether thrown away on captain thornton he reformed his line of march commanded his soldiers to unsling their firelocks and fix their bayonets and formed an advanced and rearguard each consisting of a noncommissioned officer and two soldiers who received strict orders to keep an alert lookout dougal underwent another and very close examination in which he steadfastly asserted the truth of what he had before affirmed and being rebuked on account of the suspicious and dangerous appearance of the route by which he was guiding them he answered with a sort of testiness that seemed very natural her nainsell didna mak ta road an shentlemans likit grand roads she suld hae pided at glasco all this passed off well enough and we resumed our progress our route though leading towards the lake had hitherto been so much shaded by wood that we only from time to time obtained a glimpse of that beautiful sheet of water but the road now suddenly emerged from the forest ground and winding close by the margin of the loch afforded us a full view of its spacious mirror which now the breeze having totally subsided reflected in still magnificence the high dark heathy mountains huge grey rocks and shaggy banks by which it is encircled the hills now sunk on its margin so closely and were so broken and precipitous as to afford no passage except just upon the narrow line of the track which we occupied and which was overhung with rocks from which we might have been destroyed merely by rolling down stones without much possibility of offering resistance add to this that as the road winded round every promontory and bay which indented the lake there was rarely a possibility of seeing a hundred yards before us our commander appeared to take some alarm at the nature of the pass in which he was engaged which displayed itself in repeated orders to his soldiers to be on the alert and in many threats of instant death to dougal if he should be found to have led them into danger dougal received these threats with an air of stupid impenetrability which might arise either from conscious innocence or from dogged resolution if shentlemans were seeking ta red gregarach he said to be sure they couldna expect to find her without some wee danger just as the highlander uttered these words a halt was made by the corporal commanding the advance who sent back one of the file who formed it to tell the captain that the path in front was occupied by highlanders stationed on a commanding point of particular difficulty almost at the same instant a soldier from the rear came to say that they heard the sound of a bagpipe in the woods through which we had just passed captain thornton a man of conduct as well as courage instantly resolved to force the pass in front without waiting till he was assailed from the rear and assuring his soldiers that the bagpipes which they heard were those of the friendly highlanders who were advancing to their assistance he stated to them the importance of advancing and securing rob roy if possible before these auxiliaries should come up to divide with them the honour as well as the reward which was placed on the head of this celebrated freebooter he therefore ordered the rearguard to join the centre and both to close up to the advance doubling his files so as to occupy with his column the whole practicable part of the road and to present such a front as its breadth admitted dougal to whom he said in a whisper you dog if you have deceived me you shall die for it was placed in the centre between two grenadiers with positive orders to shoot him if he attempted an escape the same situation was assigned to us as being the safest and captain thornton taking his halfpike from the soldier who carried it placed himself at the head of his little detachment and gave the word to march forward the party advanced with the firmness of english soldiers not so andrew fairservice who was frightened out of his wits and not so if truth must be told either the bailie or i myself who without feeling the same degree of trepidation could not with stoical indifference see our lives exposed to hazard in a quarrel with which we had no concern but there was neither time for remonstrance nor remedy we approached within about twenty yards of the spot where the advanced guard had seen some appearance of an enemy it was one of those promontories which run into the lake and round the base of which the road had hitherto winded in the manner i have described in the present case however the path instead of keeping the waters edge sealed the promontory by one or two rapid zigzags carried in a broken track along the precipitous face of a slaty grey rock which would otherwise have been absolutely inaccessible on the top of this rock only to be approached by a road so broken so narrow and so precarious the corporal declared he had seen the bonnets and longbarrelled guns of several mountaineers apparently couched among the long heath and brushwood which crested the eminence captain thornton ordered him to move forward with three files to dislodge the supposed ambuscade while at a more slow but steady pace he advanced to his support with the rest of his party the attack which he meditated was prevented by the unexpected apparition of a female upon the summit of the rock stand she said with a commanding tone and tell me what ye seek in macgregors country i have seldom seen a finer or more commanding form than this woman she might be between the term of forty and fifty years and had a countenance which must once have been of a masculine cast of beauty though now imprinted with deep lines by exposure to rough weather and perhaps by the wasting influence of grief and passion its features were only strong harsh and expressive she wore her plaid not drawn around her head and shoulders as is the fashion of the women in scotland but disposed around her body as the highland soldiers wear theirs she had a mans bonnet with a feather in it an unsheathed sword in her hand and a pair of pistols at her girdle its helen campbell robs wife said the bailie in a whisper of considerable alarm and there will be broken heads amang us or its lang what seek ye here she asked again of captain thornton who had himself advanced to reconnoitre we seek the outlaw rob roy macgregor campbell answered the officer and make no war on women therefore offer no vain opposition to the kings troops and assure yourself of civil treatment ay retorted the amazon i am no stranger to your tender mercies ye have left me neither name nor fame my mothers bones will shrink aside in their grave when mine are laid beside them ye have left me neither house nor hold blanket nor bedding cattle to feed us or flocks to clothe us ye have taken from us all all the very name of our ancestors have ye taken away and now ye come for our lives i seek no mans life replied the captain i only execute my orders if you are alone good woman you have nought to fear if there are any with you so rash as to offer useless resistance their own blood be on their own heads move forward sergeant forward march said the noncommissioned officer huzza my boys for rob roys head and a purse of gold he quickened his pace into a run followed by the six soldiers but as they attained the first traverse of the ascent the flash of a dozen of firelocks from various parts of the pass parted in quick succession and deliberate aim the sergeant shot through the body still struggled to gain the ascent raised himself by his hands to clamber up the face of the rock but relaxed his grasp after a desperate effort and falling rolled from the face of the cliff into the deep lake where he perished of the soldiers three fell slain or disabled the others retreated on their main body all more or less wounded grenadiers to the front said captain thornton you are to recollect that in those days this description of soldiers actually carried that destructive species of firework from which they derive their name the four grenadiers moved to the front accordingly the officer commanded the rest of the party to be ready to support them and only saying to us look to your safety gentlemen gave in rapid succession the word to the grenadiers open your pouches handle your grenades blow your matches fall on the whole advanced with a shout headed by captain thornton the grenadiers preparing to throw their grenades among the bushes where the ambuscade lay and the musketeers to support them by an instant and close assault dougal forgotten in the scuffle wisely crept into the thicket which overhung that part of the road where we had first halted which he ascended with the activity of a wild cat i followed his example instinctively recollecting that the fire of the highlanders would sweep the open track i clambered until out of breath for a continued spattering fire in which every shot was multiplied by a thousand echoes the hissing of the kindled fusees of the grenades and the successive explosion of those missiles mingled with the huzzas of the soldiers and the yells and cries of their highland antagonists formed a contrast which added i do not shame to own it wings to my desire to reach a place of safety the difficulties of the ascent soon increased so much that i despaired of reaching dougal who seemed to swing himself from rock to rock and stump to stump with the facility of a squirrel and i turned down my eyes to see what had become of my other companions both were brought to a very awkward standstill the bailie to whom i suppose fear had given a temporary share of agility had ascended about twenty feet from the path when his foot slipping as he straddled from one huge fragment of rock to another he would have slumbered with his father the deacon whose acts and words he was so fond of quoting but for a projecting branch of a ragged thorn which catching hold of the skirts of his ridingcoat supported him in midair where he dangled not unlike to the sign of the golden fleece over the door of a mercer in the trongate of his native city as for andrew fairservice he had advanced with better success until he had attained the top of a bare cliff which rising above the wood exposed him at least in his own opinion to all the dangers of the neighbouring skirmish while at the same time it was of such a precipitous and impracticable nature that he dared neither to advance nor retreat footing it up and down upon the narrow space which the top of the cliff afforded very like a fellow at a countryfair dancing upon a trencher he roared for mercy in gaelic and english alternately according to the side on which the scale of victory seemed to predominate while his exclamations were only answered by the groans of the bailie who suffered much not only from apprehension but from the pendulous posture in which he hung suspended by the loins on perceiving the bailies precarious situation my first idea was to attempt to render him assistance but this was impossible without the concurrence of andrew whom neither sign nor entreaty nor command nor expostulation could inspire with courage to adventure the descent from his painful elevation where like an unskilful and obnoxious minister of state unable to escape from the eminence to which he had presumptuously ascended he continued to pour forth piteous prayers for mercy which no one heard and to skip to and fro writhing his body into all possible antic shapes to avoid the balls which he conceived to be whistling around him in a few minutes this cause of terror ceased for the fire at first so well sustained now sunk at once a sure sign that the conflict was concluded to gain some spot from which i could see how the day had gone was now my object in order to appeal to the mercy of the victors who i trusted whichever side might be gainers would not suffer the honest bailie to remain suspended like the coffin of mahomet between heaven and earth without lending a hand to disengage him at length by dint of scrambling i found a spot which commanded a view of the field of battle it was indeed ended and as my mind already augured from the place and circumstances attending the contest it had terminated in the defeat of captain thornton i saw a party of highlanders in the act of disarming that officer and the scanty remainder of his party they consisted of about twelve men most of whom were wounded who surrounded by treble their number and without the power either to advance or retreat exposed to a murderous and wellaimed fire which they had no means of returning with effect had at length laid down their arms by the order of their officer when he saw that the road in his rear was occupied and that protracted resistance would be only wasting the lives of his brave followers by the highlanders who fought under cover the victory was cheaply bought at the expense of one man slain and two wounded by the grenades all this i learned afterwards at present i only comprehended the general result of the day from seeing the english officer whose face was covered with blood stripped of his hat and arms and his men with sullen and dejected countenances which marked their deep regret enduring from the wild and martial figures who surrounded them the severe measures to which the laws of war subject the vanquished for security of the victors chapter fourteen woe to the vanquished was stern brennos word when sunk proud rome beneath the gallic sword woe to the vanquished when his massive blade bore down the scale against her ransom weighd and on the field of foughten battle still woe knows no limits save the victors will the gaulliad i anxiously endeavoured to distinguish dougal among the victors i had little doubt that the part he had played was assumed on purpose to lead the english officer into the defile and i could not help admiring the address with which the ignorant and apparently halfbrutal savage had veiled his purpose and the affected reluctance with which he had suffered to be extracted from him the false information which it must have been his purpose from the beginning to communicate i foresaw we should incur some danger on approaching the victors in the first flush of their success which was not unstained with cruelty for one or two of the soldiers whose wounds prevented them from rising were poniarded by the victors or rather by some ragged highland boys who had mingled with them i concluded therefore it would be unsafe to present ourselves without some mediator and as campbell whom i now could not but identify with the celebrated freebooter rob roy was nowhere to be seen i resolved to claim the protection of his emissary dougal after gazing everywhere in vain i at length retraced my steps to see what assistance i could individually render to my unlucky friend when to my great joy i saw mr jarvie delivered from his state of suspense and though very black in the face and much deranged in the garments safely seated beneath the rock in front of which he had been so lately suspended i hastened to join him and offer my congratulations which he was at first far from receiving in the spirit of cordiality with which they were offered a heavy fit of coughing scarce permitted him breath enough to express the broken hints which he threw out against my sincerity uh uh uh uh they say a friend uh uh a friend sticketh closer than a brither uh uh uh when i came up here maister osbaldistone to this country cursed of god and man uh uh heaven forgie me for swearing on nae mans errand but yours dye think it was fair uh uh uh to leave me first to be shot or drowned atween redwad highlanders and redcoats and next to be hung up between heaven and earth like an auld potatobogle without sae muckle as trying uh uh sae muckle as trying to relieve me i made a thousand apologies and laboured so hard to represent the impossibility of my affording him relief by my own unassisted exertions that at length i succeeded and the bailie who was as placable as hasty in his temper extended his favour to me once more i next took the liberty of asking him how he had contrived to extricate himself me extricate i might hae hung there till the day of judgment or i could hae helped mysell wi my head hinging down on the tae side and my heels on the tother like the yarnscales in the weighhouse it was the creature dougal that extricated me as he did yestreen he cuttit aff the tails o my coat wi his durk and another gillie and him set me on my legs as cleverly as if i had never been aff them but to see what a thing gude braid claith is had i been in ony o your rotten french camlets now or your drabdeberries it would hae screeded like an auld rag wi sic a weight as mine but fair fa the weaver that wrought the weft ot i swung and bobbit yonder as safe as a gabbart thats moored by a threeply cable at the broomielaw a kind of lighter used in the river clyde probably from the french abare i now inquired what had become of his preserver the creature so he continued to call the highlandman contrived to let me ken there wad be danger in gaun near the leddy till he came back and bade me stay here i am o the mind he continued that hes seeking after you its a considerate creature and troth i wad swear he was right about the leddy as he cas her too helen campbell was nane o the maist douce maidens nor meekest wives neither and folk say that rob himsell stands in awe o her i doubt she winna ken me for its mony years since we met i am clear for waiting for the dougal creature or we gang near her i signified my acquiescence in this reasoning but it was not the will of fate that day that the bailies prudence should profit himself or any one else andrew fairservice though he had ceased to caper on the pinnacle upon the cessation of the firing which had given occasion for his whimsical exercise continued as perched on the top of an exposed cliff too conspicuous an object to escape the sharp eyes of the highlanders when they had time to look a little around them we were apprized he was discovered by a wild and loud halloo set up among the assembled victors three or four of whom instantly plunged into the copsewood and ascended the rocky side of the hill in different directions towards the place where they had discovered this whimsical apparition those who arrived first within gunshot of poor andrew did not trouble themselves to offer him any assistance in the ticklish posture of his affairs but levelling their long spanishbarrelled guns gave him to understand by signs which admitted of no misconstruction that he must contrive to come down and submit himself to their mercy or to be marked at from beneath like a regimental target set up for ballpractice with such a formidable hint for venturous exertion andrew fairservice could no longer hesitate the more imminent peril overcame his sense of that which seemed less inevitable and he began to descend the cliff at all risks clutching to the ivy and oak stumps and projecting fragments of rock with an almost feverish anxiety and never failing as circumstances left him a hand at liberty to extend it to the plaided gentry below in an attitude of supplication as if to deprecate the discharge of their levelled firearms in a word the fellow under the influence of a counteracting motive for terror achieved a safe descent from his perilous eminence which i verily believe nothing but the fear of instant death could have moved him to attempt the awkward mode of andrews descent greatly amused the highlanders below who fired a shot or two while he was engaged in it without the purpose of injuring him as i believe but merely to enhance the amusement they derived from his extreme terror and the superlative exertions of agility to which it excited him at length he attained firm and comparatively level ground or rather to speak more correctly his foot slipping at the last point of descent he fell on the earth at his full length and was raised by the assistance of the highlanders who stood to receive him and who ere he gained his legs stripped him not only of the whole contents of his pockets but of periwig hat coat doublet stockings and shoes performing the feat with such admirable celerity that although he fell on his back a wellclothed and decent burgherseeming servingman he arose a forked uncased baldpated beggarlylooking scarecrow without respect to the pain which his undefended toes experienced from the sharp encounter of the rocks over which they hurried him those who had detected andrew proceeded to drag him downward towards the road through all the intervening obstacles in the course of their descent mr jarvie and i became exposed to their lynxeyed observation and instantly halfadozen of armed highlanders thronged around us with drawn dirks and swords pointed at our faces and throats and cocked pistols presented against our bodies to have offered resistance would have been madness especially as we had no weapons capable of supporting such a demonstration we therefore submitted to our fate and with great roughness on the part of those who assisted at our toilette were in the act of being reduced to as unsophisticated a state to use king lears phrase as the plumeless biped andrew fairservice who stood shivering between fear and cold at a few yards distance good chance however saved us from this extremity of wretchedness for just as i had yielded up my cravat a smart steinkirk by the way and richly laced and the bailie had been disrobed of the fragments of his ridingcoat enter dougal and the scene was changed by a high tone of expostulation mixed with oaths and threats as far as i could conjecture the tenor of his language from the violence of his gestures he compelled the plunderers however reluctant not only to give up their further depredations on our property but to restore the spoil they had already appropriated he snatched my cravat from the fellow who had seized it and twisted it in the zeal of his restitution around my neck with such suffocating energy as made me think that he had not only been during his residence at glasgow a substitute of the jailor but must moreover have taken lessons as an apprentice of the hangman he flung the tattered remnants of mr jarvies coat around his shoulders and as more highlanders began to flock towards us from the high road he led the way downwards directing and commanding the others to afford us but particularly the bailie the assistance necessary to our descending with comparative ease and safety it was however in vain that andrew fairservice employed his lungs in obsecrating a share of dougals protection or at least his interference to procure restoration of his shoes na na said dougal in reply shes nae gentle pody i trow her petters hae ganged parefoot or shes muckle mistaen and leaving andrew to follow at his leisure or rather at such leisure as the surrounding crowd were pleased to indulge him with he hurried us down to the pathway in which the skirmish had been fought and hastened to present us as additional captives to the female leader of his band we were dragged before her accordingly dougal fighting struggling screaming as if he were the party most apprehensive of hurt and repulsing by threats and efforts all those who attempted to take a nearer interest in our capture than he seemed to do himself at length we were placed before the heroine of the day whose appearance as well as those of the savage uncouth yet martial figures who surrounded us struck me to own the truth with considerable apprehension i do not know if helen macgregor had personally mingled in the fray and indeed i was afterwards given to understand the contrary but the specks of blood on her brow her hands and naked arms as well as on the blade of her sword which she continued to hold in her hand her flushed countenance and the disordered state of the raven locks which escaped from under the red bonnet and plume that formed her headdress seemed all to intimate that she had taken an immediate share in the conflict her keen black eyes and features expressed an imagination inflamed by the pride of gratified revenge and the triumph of victory yet there was nothing positively sanguinary or cruel in her deportment and she reminded me when the immediate alarm of the interview was over of some of the paintings i had seen of the inspired heroines in the catholic churches of france she was not indeed sufficiently beautiful for a judith nor had she the inspired expression of features which painters have given to deborah or to the wife of heber the kenite at whose feet the strong oppressor of israel who dwelled in harosheth of the gentiles bowed down fell and lay a dead man nevertheless the enthusiasm by which she was agitated gave her countenance and deportment wildly dignified in themselves an air which made her approach nearly to the ideas of those wonderful artists who gave to the eye the heroines of scripture history i was uncertain in what terms to accost a personage so uncommon when mr jarvie breaking the ice with a preparatory cough for the speed with which he had been brought into her presence had again impeded his respiration addressed her as follows uh uh c c i am very happy to have this joyful opportunity a quaver in his voice strongly belied the emphasis which he studiously laid on the word joyful this joyful occasion he resumed trying to give the adjective a more suitable accentuation to wish my kinsman robins wife a very good morning uh uh hows a wi ye by this time he had talked himself into his usual jogtrot manner which exhibited a mixture of familiarity and selfimportance hows a wi ye this lang time yell hae forgotten me mrs macgregor campbell as your cousin uh uh but yell mind my father deacon nicol jarvie in the saut market o glasgow an honest man he was and a sponsible and respectit you and yours sae as i said before i am right glad to see you mrs macgregor campbell as my kinsmans wife i wad crave the liberty of a kinsman to salute you but that your gillies keep such a dolefu fast haud o my arms and to speak heavens truth and a magistrates ye wadna be the waur of a cogfu o water before ye welcomed your friends there was something in the familiarity of this introduction which ill suited the exalted state of temper of the person to whom it was addressed then busied with distributing dooms of death and warm from conquest in a perilous encounter what fellow are you she said that dare to claim kindred with the macgregor and neither wear his dress nor speak his language what are you that have the tongue and the habit of the hound and yet seek to lie down with the deer i dinna ken said the undaunted bailie if the kindred has ever been weel redd out to you yet cousin but its kend and can be provd my mother elspeth macfarlane was the wife of my father deacon nicol jarvie peace be wi them baith and elspeth was the daughter of parlane macfarlane at the sheeling o loch sloy now this parlane macfarlane as his surviving daughter maggy macfarlane alias macnab wha married duncan macnab o stuckavrallachan can testify stood as near to your gudeman robert macgregor as in the fourth degree of kindred for the virago lopped the genealogical tree by demanding haughtily if a stream of rushing water acknowledged any relation with the portion withdrawn from it for the mean domestic uses of those who dwelt on its banks vera true kinswoman said the bailie but for a that the burn wad be glad to hae the milldam back again in simmer when the chuckiestanes are white in the sun i ken weel eneugh you hieland folk haud us glasgow people light and cheap for our language and our claes but everybody speaks their native tongue that they learned in infancy and it would be a daftlike thing to see me wi my fat wame in a short hieland coat and my puir short houghs gartered below the knee like ane o your langlegged gillies mair by token kinswoman he continued in defiance of various intimations by which dougal seemed to recommend silence as well as of the marks of impatience which the amazon evinced at his loquacity i wad hae ye to mind that the kings errand whiles comes in the cadgers gate and that for as high as ye may think o the gudeman as its right every wife should honour her husband theres scripture warrant for that yet as high as ye haud him as i was saying i hae been serviceable to rob ere now forbye a set o pearlins i sent yourself when ye was gaun to be married and when rob was an honest weeldoing drover and nane o this unlawfu wark wi fighting and flashes and fluffgibs disturbing the kings peace and disarming his soldiers he had apparently touched on a key which his kinswoman could not brook she drew herself up to her full height and betrayed the acuteness of her feelings by a laugh of mingled scorn and bitterness yes she said you and such as you might claim a relation to us when we stooped to be the paltry wretches fit to exist under your dominion as your hewers of wood and drawers of water to find cattle for your banquets and subjects for your laws to oppress and trample on but now we are free free by the very act which left us neither house nor hearth food nor covering which bereaved me of all of all and makes me groan when i think i must still cumber the earth for other purposes than those of vengeance and i will carry on the work this day has so well commenced by a deed that shall break all bands between macgregor and the lowland churls here allan dougal bind these sassenachs neck and heel together and throw them into the highland loch to seek for their highland kinsfolk the bailie alarmed at this mandate was commencing an expostulation which probably would have only inflamed the violent passions of the person whom he addressed when dougal threw himself between them and in his own language which he spoke with a fluency and rapidity strongly contrasted by the slow imperfect and idiotlike manner in which he expressed himself in english poured forth what i doubt not was a very animated pleading in our behalf his mistress replied to him or rather cut short his harangue by exclaiming in english as if determined to make us taste in anticipation the full bitterness of death base dog and son of a dog do you dispute my commands should i tell ye to cut out their tongues and put them into each others throats to try which would there best knap southron or to tear out their hearts and put them into each others breasts to see which would there best plot treason against the macgregor and such things have been done of old in the day of revenge when our fathers had wrongs to redress should i command you to do this would it be your part to dispute my orders to be sure to be sure dougal replied with accents of profound submission her pleasure suld be done tats but reason but an it were tat is an it could be thought the same to her to coup the illfaured loon of ta redcoat captain and hims corporal cramp and twa three o the redcoats into the loch herself wad dot wi muckle mair great satisfaction than to hurt ta honest civil shentlemans as were friends to the gregarach and came up on the chiefs assurance and not to do no treason as herself could testify the lady was about to reply when a few wild strains of a pibroch were heard advancing up the road from aberfoil the same probably which had reached the ears of captain thorntons rearguard and determined him to force his way onward rather than return to the village on finding the pass occupied the skirmish being of very short duration the armed men who followed this martial melody had not although quickening their march when they heard the firing been able to arrive in time sufficient to take any share in the rencontre the victory therefore was complete without them and they now arrived only to share in the triumph of their countrymen there was a marked difference betwixt the appearance of these new comers and that of the party by which our escort had been defeated and it was greatly in favour of the former among the highlanders who surrounded the chieftainess if i may presume to call her so without offence to grammar were men in the extremity of age boys scarce able to bear a sword and even women all in short whom the last necessity urges to take up arms and it added a shade of bitter shame to the defection which clouded thorntons manly countenance when he found that the numbers and position of a foe otherwise so despicable had enabled them to conquer his brave veterans but the thirty or forty highlanders who now joined the others were all men in the prime of youth or manhood active cleanmade fellows whose short hose and belted plaids set out their sinewy limbs to the best advantage their arms were as superior to those of the first party as their dress and appearance the followers of the female chief had axes scythes and other antique weapons in aid of their guns and some had only clubs daggers and long knives but of the second party most had pistols at the belt and almost all had dirks hanging at the pouches which they wore in front each had a good gun in his hand and a broadsword by his side besides a stout round target made of light wood covered with leather and curiously studded with brass and having a steel spike screwed into the centre these hung on their left shoulder during a march or while they were engaged in exchanging fire with the enemy and were worn on their left arm when they charged with sword in hand but it was easy to see that this chosen band had not arrived from a victory such as they found their illappointed companions possessed of the pibroch sent forth occasionally a few wailing notes expressive of a very different sentiment from triumph and when they appeared before the wife of their chieftain it was in silence and with downcast and melancholy looks they paused when they approached her and the pipes again sent forth the same wild and melancholy strain helen rushed towards them with a countenance in which anger was mingled with apprehension what means this alaster she said to the minstrel why a lament in the moment of victory robert hamish wheres the macgregor wheres your father her sons who led the band advanced with slow and irresolute steps towards her and murmured a few words in gaelic at hearing which she set up a shriek that made the rocks ring again in which all the women and boys joined clapping their hands and yelling as if their lives had been expiring in the sound the mountain echoes silent since the military sounds of battle had ceased had now to answer these frantic and discordant shrieks of sorrow which drove the very nightbirds from their haunts in the rocks as if they were startled to hear orgies more hideous and illomened than their own performed in the face of open day taken repeated helen when the clamour had subsided taken captive and you live to say so coward dogs did i nurse you for this that you should spare your blood on your fathers enemies or see him prisoner and come back to tell it the sons of macgregor to whom this expostulation was addressed were youths of whom the eldest had hardly attained his twentieth year hamish or james the elder of these youths was the tallest by a head and much handsomer than his brother his lightblue eyes with a profusion of fair hair which streamed from under his smart blue bonnet made his whole appearance a most favourable specimen of the highland youth the younger was called robert but to distinguish him from his father the highlanders added the epithet oig or the young dark hair and dark features with a ruddy glow of health and animation and a form strong and wellset beyond his years completed the sketch of the young mountaineer both now stood before their mother with countenances clouded with grief and shame and listened with the most respectful submission to the reproaches with which she loaded them at length when her resentment appeared in some degree to subside the eldest speaking in english probably that he might not be understood by their followers endeavoured respectfully to vindicate himself and his brother from his mothers reproaches i was so near him as to comprehend much of what he said and as it was of great consequence to me to be possessed of information in this strange crisis i failed not to listen as attentively as i could the macgregor his son stated had been called out upon a trysting with a lowland hallion who came with a token from he muttered the name very low but i thought it sounded like my own the macgregor he said accepted of the invitation but commanded the saxon who brought the message to be detained as a hostage that good faith should be observed to him accordingly he went to the place of appointment which had some wild highland name that i cannot remember attended only by angus breck and little rory commanding no one to follow him within half an hour angus breck came back with the doleful tidings that the macgregor had been surprised and made prisoner by a party of lennox militia under galbraith of garschattachin he added that galbraith on being threatened by macgregor who upon his capture menaced him with retaliation on the person of the hostage had treated the threat with great contempt replying let each side hang his man well hang the thief and your catherans may hang the gauger rob and the country will be rid of two damned things at once a wild highlander and a revenue officer angus breck less carefully looked to than his master contrived to escape from the hands of the captors after having been in their custody long enough to hear this discussion and to bring off the news and did you learn this you falsehearted traitor said the wife of macgregor and not instantly rush to your fathers rescue to bring him off or leave your body on the place the young macgregor modestly replied by representing the very superior force of the enemy and stated that as they made no preparation for leaving the country he had fallen back up the glen with the purpose of collecting a band sufficient to attempt a rescue with some tolerable chance of success at length he said the militiamen would quarter he understood in the neighbouring house of gartartan or the old castle in the port of monteith or some other stronghold which although strong and defensible was nevertheless capable of being surprised could they but get enough of men assembled for the purpose i understood afterwards that the rest of the freebooters followers were divided into two strong bands one destined to watch the remaining garrison of inversnaid a party of which under captain thornton had been defeated and another to show front to the highland clans who had united with the regular troops and lowlanders in this hostile and combined invasion of that mountainous and desolate territory which lying between the lakes of loch lomond loch katrine and loch ard was at this time currently called rob roys or the macgregor country messengers were despatched in great haste to concentrate as i supposed their forces with a view to the purposed attack on the lowlanders and the dejection and despair at first visible on each countenance gave place to the hope of rescuing their leader and to the thirst of vengeance it was under the burning influence of the latter passion that the wife of macgregor commanded that the hostage exchanged for his safety should be brought into her presence i believe her sons had kept this unfortunate wretch out of her sight for fear of the consequences but if it was so their humane precaution only postponed his fate they dragged forward at her summons a wretch already half dead with terror in whose agonised features i recognised to my horror and astonishment my old acquaintance morris he fell prostrate before the female chief with an effort to clasp her knees from which she drew back as if his touch had been pollution so that all he could do in token of the extremity of his humiliation was to kiss the hem of her plaid i never heard entreaties for life poured forth with such agony of spirit the ecstasy of fear was such that instead of paralysing his tongue as on ordinary occasions it even rendered him eloquent and with cheeks pale as ashes hands compressed in agony eyes that seemed to be taking their last look of all mortal objects he protested with the deepest oaths his total ignorance of any design on the person of rob roy whom he swore he loved and honoured as his own soul in the inconsistency of his terror he said he was but the agent of others and he muttered the name of rashleigh he prayed but for life for life he would give all he had in the world it was but life he asked life if it were to be prolonged under tortures and privations he asked only breath though it should be drawn in the damps of the lowest caverns of their hills it is impossible to describe the scorn the loathing and contempt with which the wife of macgregor regarded this wretched petitioner for the poor boon of existence i could have bid ye live she said had life been to you the same weary and wasting burden that it is to me that it is to every noble and generous mind but you wretch you could creep through the world unaffected by its various disgraces its ineffable miseries its constantly accumulating masses of crime and sorrow you could live and enjoy yourself while the nobleminded are betrayed while nameless and birthless villains tread on the neck of the brave and the longdescended you could enjoy yourself like a butchers dog in the shambles battening on garbage while the slaughter of the oldest and best went on around you this enjoyment you shall not live to partake of you shall die base dog and that before yon cloud has passed over the sun she gave a brief command in gaelic to her attendants two of whom seized upon the prostrate suppliant and hurried him to the brink of a cliff which overhung the flood he set up the most piercing and dreadful cries that fear ever uttered i may well term them dreadful for they haunted my sleep for years afterwards as the murderers or executioners call them as you will dragged him along he recognised me even in that moment of horror and exclaimed in the last articulate words i ever heard him utter oh mr osbaldistone save me save me i was so much moved by this horrid spectacle that although in momentary expectation of sharing his fate i did attempt to speak in his behalf but as might have been expected my interference was sternly disregarded the victim was held fast by some while others binding a large heavy stone in a plaid tied it round his neck and others again eagerly stripped him of some part of his dress halfnaked and thus manacled they hurled him into the lake there about twelve feet deep with a loud halloo of vindictive triumph above which however his last deathshriek the yell of mortal agony was distinctly heard the heavy burden splashed in the darkblue waters and the highlanders with their poleaxes and swords watched an instant to guard lest extricating himself from the load to which he was attached the victim might have struggled to regain the shore but the knot had been securely bound the wretched man sunk without effort the waters which his fall had disturbed settled calmly over him and the unit of that life for which he had pleaded so strongly was for ever withdrawn from the sum of human existence chapter fifteen and be he safe restored ere evening set or if theres vengeance in an injured heart and power to wreak it in an armed hand your land shall ache fort old play i know not why it is that a single deed of violence and cruelty affects our nerves more than when these are exercised on a more extended scale i had seen that day several of my brave countrymen fall in battle it seemed to me that they met a lot appropriate to humanity and my bosom though thrilling with interest was affected with nothing of that sickening horror with which i beheld the unfortunate morris put to death without resistance and in cold blood i looked at my companion mr jarvie whose face reflected the feelings which were painted in mine indeed he could not so suppress his horror but that the words escaped him in a low and broken whisper i take up my protest against this deed as a bloody and cruel murder it is a cursed deed and god will avenge it in his due way and time then you do not fear to follow said the virago bending on him a look of death such as that with which a hawk looks at his prey ere he pounces kinswoman said the bailie nae man willingly wad cut short his thread of life before the end o his pirn was fairly measured off on the yarnwinles and i hae muckle to do an i be spared in this warld public and private business as weel that belonging to the magistracy as to my ain particular and nae doubt i hae some to depend on me as puir mattie wha is an orphan shes a farawa cousin o the laird o limmerfield sae that laying a this thegither skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life and were i to set you at liberty said the imperious dame what name could you give to the drowning of that saxon dog uh uh hem hem said the bailie clearing his throat as well as he could i suld study to say as little on that score as might be least said is sunest mended but if you were called on by the courts as you term them of justice she again demanded what then would be your answer the bailie looked this way and that way like a person who meditates an escape and then answered in the tone of one who seeing no means of accomplishing a retreat determines to stand the brunt of battle i see what you are driving me to the wa about but ill tell yout plain kinswoman i behoved just to speak according to my ain conscience and though your ain gudeman that i wish had been here for his ain sake and mine as wool as the puir hieland creature dougal can tell ye that nicol jarvie can wink as hard at a friends failings as onybody yet ise tell ye kinswoman mines neer be the tongue to belie my thought and sooner than say that yonder puir wretch was lawfully slaughtered i wad consent to be laid beside him though i think ye are the first hieland woman wad mint sic a doom to her husbands kinsman but four times removed it is probable that the tone and firmness assumed by the bailie in his last speech was better suited to make an impression on the hard heart of his kinswoman than the tone of supplication he had hitherto assumed as gems can be cut with steel though they resist softer metals she commanded us both to be placed before her your name she said to me is osbaldistone the dead dog whose death you have witnessed called you so my name is osbaldistone was my answer rashleigh then i suppose is your christian name she pursued no my name is francis but you know rashleigh osbaldistone she continued he is your brother if i mistake not at least your kinsman and near friend he is my kinsman i replied but not my friend we were lately engaged together in a rencontre when we were separated by a person whom i understand to be your husband my blood is hardly yet dried on his sword and the wound on my side is yet green i have little reason to acknowledge him as a friend then she replied if a stranger to his intrigues you can go in safety to garschattachin and his party without fear of being detained and carry them a message from the wife of the macgregor i answered that i knew no reasonable cause why the militia gentlemen should detain me that i had no reason on my own account to fear being in their hands and that if my going on her embassy would act as a protection to my friend and servant who were here prisoners i was ready to set out directly i took the opportunity to say that i had come into this country on her husbands invitation and his assurance that he would aid me in some important matters in which i was interested that my companion mr jarvie had accompanied me on the same errand and i wish mr jarvies boots had been fu o boiling water when he drew them on for sic a purpose interrupted the bailie you may read your father said helen macgregor turning to her sons in what this young saxon tells us wise only when the bonnet is on his head and the sword is in his hand he never exchanges the tartan for the broadcloth but he runs himself into the miserable intrigues of the lowlanders and becomes again after all he has suffered their agent their tool their slave add madam said i and their benefactor be it so she said for it is the most empty title of them all since he has uniformly sown benefits to reap a harvest of the most foul ingratitude but enough of this i shall cause you to be guided to the enemys outposts ask for their commander and deliver him this message from me helen macgregor that if they injure a hair of macgregors head and if they do not set him at liberty within the space of twelve hours there is not a lady in the lennox but shall before christmas cry the coronach for them she will be loath to lose there is not a farmer but shall sing wellawa over a burnt barnyard and an empty byre there is not a laird nor heritor shall lay his head on the pillow at night with the assurance of being a live man in the morning and to begin as we are to end so soon as the term is expired i will send them this glasgow bailie and this saxon captain and all the rest of my prisoners each bundled in a plaid and chopped into as many pieces as there are checks in the tartan as she paused in her denunciation captain thornton who was within hearing added with great coolness present my compliments captain thorntons of the royals compliments to the commanding officer and tell him to do his duty and secure his prisoner and not waste a thought upon me if i have been fool enough to have been led into an ambuscade by these artful savages i am wise enough to know how to die for it without disgracing the service i am only sorry for my poor fellows he said that have fallen into such butcherly hands whist whist exclaimed the bailie are ye weary o your life yell gie my service to the commanding officer mr osbaldistone bailie nicol jarvies service a magistrate o glasgow as his father the deacon was before him and tell him here are a wheen honest men in great trouble and like to come to mair and the best thing he can do for the common good will be just to let rob come his was up the glen and nae mair about it theres been some ill dune here already but as it has lighted chiefly on the gauger it winna be muckle worth making a stir about with these very opposite injunctions from the parties chiefly interested in the success of my embassy and with the reiterated charge of the wife of macgregor to remember and detail every word of her injunctions i was at length suffered to depart and andrew fairservice chiefly i believe to get rid of his clamorous supplications was permitted to attend me doubtful however that i might use my horse as a means of escape from my guides or desirous to retain a prize of some value i was given to understand that i was to perform my journey on foot escorted by hamish macgregor the elder brother who with two followers attended as well to show me the way as to reconnoitre the strength and position of the enemy dougal had been at first ordered on this party but he contrived to elude the service with the purpose as we afterwards understood of watching over mr jarvie whom according to his wild principles of fidelity he considered as entitled to his good offices from having once acted in some measure as his patron or master after walking with great rapidity about an hour we arrived at an eminence covered with brushwood which gave us a commanding prospect down the valley and a full view of the post which the militia occupied being chiefly cavalry they had judiciously avoided any attempt to penetrate the pass which had been so unsuccessfully essayed by captain thornton they had taken up their situation with some military skill on a rising ground in the centre of the little valley of aberfoil through which the river forth winds its earliest course and which is formed by two ridges of hills faced with barricades of limestone rock intermixed with huge masses of breecia or pebbles imbedded in some softer substance which has hardened around them like mortar and surrounded by the more lofty mountains in the distance these ridges however left the valley of breadth enough to secure the cavalry from any sudden surprise by the mountaineers and they had stationed sentinels and outposts at proper distances from this main body in every direction so that they might secure full time to mount and get under arms upon the least alarm it was not indeed expected at that time that highlanders would attack cavalry in an open plain though late events have shown that they may do so with success the affairs of prestonpans and falkirk are probably alluded to which marks the time of writing the memoirs as subsequent to when i first knew the highlanders they had almost a superstitious dread of a mounted trooper the horse being so much more fierce and imposing in his appearance than the little shelties of their own hills and moreover being trained as the more ignorant mountaineers believed to fight with his feet and his teeth the appearance of the piequeted horses feeding in this little vale the forms of the soldiers as they sate stood or walked in various groups in the vicinity of the beautiful river and of the bare yet romantic ranges of rock which hedge in the landscape on either side formed a noble foreground while far to the eastward the eye caught a glance of the lake of menteith and stirling castle dimly seen along with the blue and distant line of the ochil mountains closed the scene after gazing on this landscape with great earnestness young macgregor intimated to me that i was to descend to the station of the militia and execute my errand to their commander enjoining me at the same time with a menacing gesture neither to inform them who had guided me to that place nor where i had parted from my escort thus tutored i descended towards the military post followed by andrew who only retaining his breeches and stockings of the english costume without a hat barelegged with brogues on his feet which dougal had given him out of compassion and having a tattered plaid to supply the want of all upper garments looked as if he had been playing the part of a highland tomofbedlam we had not proceeded far before we became visible to one of the videttes who riding towards us presented his carabine and commanded me to stand i obeyed and when the soldier came up desired to be conducted to his commandingofficer i was immediately brought where a circle of officers sitting upon the grass seemed in attendance upon one of superior rank he wore a cuirass of polished steel over which were drawn the insignia of the ancient order of the thistle my friend garschattachin and many other gentlemen some in uniform others in their ordinary dress but all armed and well attended seemed to receive their orders from this person of distinction many servants in rich liveries apparently a part of his household were also in waiting having paid to this nobleman the respect which his rank appeared to demand i acquainted him that i had been an involuntary witness to the kings soldiers having suffered a defeat from the highlanders at the pass of lochard such i had learned was the name of the place where mr thornton was made prisoner and that the victors threatened every species of extremity to those who had fallen into their power as well as to the low country in general unless their chief who had that morning been made prisoner were returned to them uninjured the duke for he whom i addressed was of no lower rank listened to me with great composure and then replied that he should be extremely sorry to expose the unfortunate gentlemen who had been made prisoners to the cruelty of the barbarians into whose hands they had fallen but that it was folly to suppose that he would deliver up the very author of all these disorders and offences and so encourage his followers in their license you may return to those who sent you he proceeded and inform them that i shall certainly cause rob roy campbell whom they call macgregor to be executed by break of day as an outlaw taken in arms and deserving death by a thousand acts of violence that i should be most justly held unworthy of my situation and commission did i act otherwise that i shall know how to protect the country against their insolent threats of violence and that if they injure a hair of the head of any of the unfortunate gentlemen whom an unlucky accident has thrown into their power i will take such ample vengeance that the very stones of their glens shall sing woe for it this hundred years to come i humbly begged leave to remonstrate respecting the honourable mission imposed on me and touched upon the obvious danger attending it when the noble commander replied that such being the case i might send my servant the deil be in my feet said andrew without either having respect to the presence in which he stood or waiting till i replied the deil be in my feet if i gang my taes length do the folk think i hae another thrapple in my pouch after john highlandmans sneeked this ane wi his joctaleg or that i can dive doun at the tae side of a highland loch and rise at the tother like a shelldrake na na ilk ane for himsell and god for us a folk may just make a page o their ain age and serve themsells till their bairns grow up and gang their ain errands for andrew rob roy never came near the parish of dreepdaily to steal either pippin or pear frae me or mine silencing my follower with some difficulty i represented to the duke the great danger captain thornton and mr jarvie would certainly be exposed to and entreated he would make me the bearer of such modified terms as might be the means of saving their lives i assured him i should decline no danger if i could be of service but from what i had heard and seen i had little doubt they would be instantly murdered should the chief of the outlaws suffer death the duke was obviously much affected it was a hard case he said and he felt it as such but he had a paramount duty to perform to the country rob roy must die i own it was not without emotion that i heard this threat of instant death to my acquaintance campbell who had so often testified his goodwill towards me nor was i singular in the feeling for many of those around the duke ventured to express themselves in his favour it would be more advisable they said to send him to stirling castle and there detain him a close prisoner as a pledge for the submission and dispersion of his gang it were a great pity to expose the country to be plundered which now that the long nights approached it would be found very difficult to prevent since it was impossible to guard every point and the highlanders were sure to select those that were left exposed they added that there was great hardship in leaving the unfortunate prisoners to the almost certain doom of massacre denounced against them which no one doubted would be executed in the first burst of revenge garschattachin ventured yet farther confiding in the honour of the nobleman whom he addressed although he knew he had particular reasons for disliking their prisoner rob roy he said though a kittle neighbour to the low country and particularly obnoxious to his grace and though he maybe carried the catheran trade farther than ony man o his day was an auldfarrand carle and there might be some means of making him hear reason whereas his wife and sons were reckless fiends without either fear or mercy about them and at the head of a his limmer loons would be a worse plague to the country than ever he had been pooh pooh replied his grace it is the very sense and cunning of this fellow which has so long maintained his reign a mere highland robber would have been put down in as many weeks as he has flourished years his gang without him is no more to be dreaded as a permanent annoyance it will no longer exist than a wasp without its head which may sting once perhaps but is instantly crushed into annihilation garschattachin was not so easily silenced i am sure my lord duke he replied i have no favour for rob and he as little for me seeing he has twice cleaned out my ain byres beside skaith amang my tenants but however but however garschattachin said the duke with a smile of peculiar expression i fancy you think such a freedom may be pardoned in a friends friend and robs supposed to be no enemy to major galbraiths friends over the water if it be so my lord said garschattachin in the same tone of jocularity its no the warst thing i have heard of him but i wish we heard some news from the clans that we have waited for sae lang i vow to god theyll keep a hielandmans word wi us i never kend them better its ill drawing boots upon trews i cannot believe it said the duke these gentlemen are known to be men of honour and i must necessarily suppose they are to keep their appointment send out two more horsemen to look for our friends we cannot till their arrival pretend to attack the pass where captain thornton has suffered himself to be surprised and which to my knowledge ten men on foot might make good against a regiment of the best horse in europe meanwhile let refreshments be given to the men i had the benefit of this last order the more necessary and acceptable as i had tasted nothing since our hasty meal at aberfoil the evening before the videttes who had been despatched returned without tidings of the expected auxiliaries and sunset was approaching when a highlander belonging to the clans whose cooperation was expected appeared as the bearer of a letter which he delivered to the duke with a most profound conge now will i wad a hogshead of claret said garschattachin that this is a message to tell us that these cursed highlandmen whom we have fetched here at the expense of so much plague and vexation are going to draw off and leave us to do our own business if we can it is even so gentlemen said the duke reddening with indignation after having perused the letter which was written upon a very dirty scrap of paper but most punctiliously addressed for the muchhonoured hands of ane high and mighty prince the duke c c c our allies continued the duke have deserted us gentlemen and have made a separate peace with the enemy its just the fate of all alliances said garschattachin the dutch were gaun to serve us the same gate if we had not got the start of them at utrecht you are facetious air said the duke with a frown which showed how little he liked the pleasantry but our business is rather of a grave cut just now i suppose no gentleman would advise our attempting to penetrate farther into the country unsupported either by friendly highlanders or by infantry from inversnaid a general answer announced that the attempt would be perfect madness nor would there be great wisdom the duke added in remaining exposed to a nightattack in this place i therefore propose that we should retreat to the house of duchray and that of gartartan and keep safe and sure watch and ward until morning but before we separate i will examine rob roy before you all and make you sensible by your own eyes and ears of the extreme unfitness of leaving him space for farther outrage he gave orders accordingly and the prisoner was brought before him his arms belted down above the elbow and secured to his body by a horsegirth buckled tight behind him two noncommissioned officers had hold of him one on each side and two file of men with carabines and fixed bayonets attended for additional security i had never seen this man in the dress of his country which set in a striking point of view the peculiarities of his form a shockhead of red hair which the hat and periwig of the lowland costume had in a great measure concealed was seen beneath the highland bonnet and verified the epithet of roy or red by which he was much better known in the low country than by any other and is still i suppose best remembered the justice of the appellation was also vindicated by the appearance of that part of his limbs from the bottom of his kilt to the top of his short hose which the fashion of his country dress left bare and which was covered with a fell of thick short red hair especially around his knees which resembled in this respect as well as from their sinewy appearance of extreme strength the limbs of a redcoloured highland bull upon the whole betwixt the effect produced by the change of dress and by my having become acquainted with his real and formidable character his appearance had acquired to my eyes something so much wilder and more striking than it before presented that i could scarce recognise him to be the same person his manner was bold unconstrained unless by the actual bonds haughty and even dignified he bowed to the duke nodded to garschattachin and others and showed some surprise at seeing me among the party it is long since we have met mr campbell said the duke it is so my lord duke i could have wished it had been looking at the fastening on his arms when i could have better paid the compliments i owe to your grace but theres a gude time coming no time like the time present mr campbell answered the duke for the hours are fast flying that must settle your last account with all mortal affairs i do not say this to insult your distress but you must be aware yourself that you draw near the end of your career i do not deny that you may sometimes have done less harm than others of your unhappy trade and that you may occasionally have exhibited marks of talent and even of a disposition which promised better things but you are aware how long you have been the terror and the oppressor of a peaceful neighbourhood and by what acts of violence you have maintained and extended your usurped authority you know in short that you have deserved death and that you must prepare for it my lord said rob roy although i may well lay my misfortunes at your graces door yet i will never say that you yourself have been the wilful and witting author of them my lord if i had thought sae your grace would not this day have been sitting in judgment on me for you have been three times within good rifle distance of me when you were thinking but of the red deer and few people have kend me miss my aim but as for them that have abused your graces ear and set you up against a man that was ance as peacefu a man as ony in the land and made your name the warrant for driving me to utter extremity i have had some amends of them and for a that your grace now says i expect to live to hae mair i know said the duke in rising anger that you are a determined and impudent villain who will keep his oath if he swears to mischief but it shall be my care to prevent you you have no enemies but your own wicked actions had i called myself grahame instead of campbell i might have heard less about them answered rob roy with dogged resolution you will do well sir said the duke to warn your wife and family and followers to beware how they use the gentlemen now in their hands as i will requite tenfold on them and their kin and allies the slightest injury done to any of his majestys liege subjects my lord said roy in answer none of my enemies will allege that i have been a bloodthirsty man and were i now wi my folk i could rule four or five hundred wild hielanders as easy as your grace those eight or ten lackeys and footboys but if your grace is bent to take the head away from a house ye may lay your account there will be misrule amang the members however come ot what like theres an honest man a kinsman o my ain maun come by nae skaith is there ony body here wad do a gude deed for macgregor he may repay it though his hands be now tied the highlander who had delivered the letter to the duke replied ill do your will for you macgregor and ill gang back up the glen on purpose he advanced and received from the prisoner a message to his wife which being in gaelic i did not understand but i had little doubt it related to some measures to be taken for the safety of mr jarvie do you hear the fellows impudence said the duke he confides in his character of a messenger his conduct is of a piece with his masters who invited us to make common cause against these freebooters and have deserted us so soon as the macgregors have agreed to surrender the balquhidder lands they were squabbling about no truth in plaids no faith in tartan trews chameleonlike they change a thousand hues your great ancestor never said so my lord answered major galbraith and with submission neither would your grace have occasion to say it wad ye but be for beginning justice at the wellhead gie the honest man his mear again let every head wear its ane bannet and the distractions o the lennox wad be mended wi them othe land hush hush garschattachin said the duke this is language dangerous for you to talk to any one and especially to me but i presume you reckon yourself a privileged person please to draw off your party towards gartartan i shall myself see the prisoner escorted to duchray and send you orders tomorrow you will please grant no leave of absence to any of your troopers heres auld ordering and counterordering muttered garschattachin between his teeth but patience patience we may ae day play at change seats the kings coming the two troops of cavalry now formed and prepared to march off the ground that they might avail themselves of the remainder of daylight to get to their evening quarters i received an intimation rather than an invitation to attend the party and i perceived that though no longer considered as a prisoner i was yet under some sort of suspicion the times were indeed so dangerous the great party questions of jacobite and hanoverian divided the country so effectually and the constant disputes and jealousies between the highlanders and lowlanders besides a number of inexplicable causes of feud which separated the great leading families in scotland from each other occasioned such general suspicion that a solitary and unprotected stranger was almost sure to meet with something disagreeable in the course of his travels i acquiesced however in my destination with the best grace i could consoling myself with the hope that i might obtain from the captive freebooter some information concerning rashleigh and his machinations i should do myself injustice did i not add that my views were not merely selfish i was too much interested in my singular acquaintance not to be desirous of rendering him such services as his unfortunate situation might demand or admit of his receiving chapter sixteen and when he came to broken brigg he bent his bow and swam and when he came to grass growing set down his feet and ran gil morrice the echoes of the rocks and ravines on either side now rang to the trumpets of the cavalry which forming themselves into two distinct bodies began to move down the valley at a slow trot that commanded by major galbraith soon took to the right hand and crossed the forth for the purpose of taking up the quarters assigned them for the night when they were to occupy as i understood an old castle in the vicinity they formed a lively object while crossing the stream but were soon lost in winding up the bank on the opposite side which was clothed with wood we continued our march with considerable good order to ensure the safe custody of the prisoner the duke had caused him to be placed on horseback behind one of his retainers called as i was informed ewan of brigglands one of the largest and strongest men who were present a horsebelt passed round the bodies of both and buckled before the yeomans breast rendered it impossible for rob roy to free himself from his keeper i was directed to keep close beside them and accommodated for the purpose with a troophorse we were as closely surrounded by the soldiers as the width of the road would permit and had always at least one if not two on each side with pistol in hand andrew fairservice furnished with a highland pony of which they had made prey somewhere or other was permitted to ride among the other domestics of whom a great number attended the line of march though without falling into the ranks of the more regularly trained troopers in this manner we travelled for a certain distance until we arrived at a place where we also were to cross the river the forth as being the outlet of a lake is of considerable depth even where less important in point of width and the descent to the ford was by a broken precipitous ravine which only permitted one horseman to descend at once the rear and centre of our small body halting on the bank while the front files passed down in succession produced a considerable delay as is usual on such occasions and even some confusion for a number of those riders who made no proper part of the squadron crowded to the ford without regularity and made the militia cavalry although tolerably well drilled partake in some degree of their own disorder illustration escape of rob roy at the ford it was while we were thus huddled together on the bank that i heard rob roy whisper to the man behind whom he was placed on horseback your father ewan wadna hae carried an auld friend to the shambles like a calf for a the dukes in christendom ewan returned no answer but shrugged as one who would express by that sign that what he was doing was none of his own choice and when the macgregors come down the glen and ye see toom faulds a bluidy hearthstone and the fire flashing out between the rafters o your house ye may be thinking then ewan that were your friend rob to the fore you would have had that safe which it will make your heart sair to lose ewan of brigglands again shrugged and groaned but remained silent its a sair thing continued rob sliding his insinuations so gently into ewans ear that they reached no other but mine who certainly saw myself in no shape called upon to destroy his prospects of escape its a sair thing that ewan of brigglands whom roy macgregor has helped with hand sword and purse suld mind a gloom from a great man mair than a friends life ewan seemed sorely agitated but was silent we heard the dukes voice from the opposite bank call bring over the prisoner ewan put his horse in motion and just as i heard roy say never weigh a macgregors bluid against a broken whang o leather for there will be another accounting to gie for it baith here and hereafter they passed me hastily and dashing forward rather precipitately entered the water not yet sir not yet said some of the troopers to me as i was about to follow while others pressed forward into the stream i saw the duke on the other side by the waning light engaged in commanding his people to get into order as they landed dispersedly some higher some lower many had crossed some were in the water and the rest were preparing to follow when a sudden splash warned me that macgregors eloquence had prevailed on ewan to give him freedom and a chance for life the duke also heard the sound and instantly guessed its meaning dog he exclaimed to ewan as he landed where is your prisoner and without waiting to hear the apology which the terrified vassal began to falter forth he fired a pistol at his head whether fatally i know not and exclaimed gentlemen disperse and pursue the villain an hundred guineas for him that secures rob roy all became an instant scene of the most lively confusion rob roy disengaged from his bonds doubtless by ewans slipping the buckle of his belt had dropped off at the horses tail and instantly dived passing under the belly of the troophorse which was on his left hand but as he was obliged to come to the surface an instant for air the glimpse of his tartan plaid drew the attention of the troopers some of whom plunged into the river with a total disregard to their own safety rushing according to the expression of their country through pool and stream sometimes swimming their horses sometimes losing them and struggling for their own lives others less zealous or more prudent broke off in different directions and galloped up and down the banks to watch the places at which the fugitive might possibly land the hollowing the whooping the calls for aid at different points where they saw or conceived they saw some vestige of him they were seeking the frequent report of pistols and carabines fired at every object which excited the least suspicion the sight of so many horsemen riding about in and out of the river and striking with their long broadswords at whatever excited their attention joined to the vain exertions used by their officers to restore order and regularity and all this in so wild a scene and visible only by the imperfect twilight of an autumn evening made the most extraordinary hubbub i had hitherto witnessed i was indeed left alone to observe it for our whole cavalcade had dispersed in pursuit or at least to see the event of the search indeed as i partly suspected at the time and afterwards learned with certainty many of those who seemed most active in their attempts to waylay and recover the fugitive were in actual truth least desirous that he should be taken and only joined in the cry to increase the general confusion and to give rob roy a better opportunity of escaping escape indeed was not difficult for a swimmer so expert as the freebooter as soon as he had eluded the first burst of pursuit at one time he was closely pressed and several blows were made which flashed in the water around him the scene much resembling one of the otterhunts which i had seen at osbaldistone hall where the animal is detected by the hounds from his being necessitated to put his nose above the stream to vent or breathe while he is enabled to elude them by getting under water again so soon as he has refreshed himself by respiration macgregor however had a trick beyond the otter for he contrived when very closely pursued to disengage himself unobserved from his plaid and suffer it to float down the stream where in its progress it quickly attracted general attention many of the horsemen were thus put upon a false scent and several shots or stabs were averted from the party for whom they were designed once fairly out of view the recovery of the prisoner became almost impossible since in so many places the river was rendered inaccessible by the steepness of its banks or the thickets of alders poplars and birch which overhanging its banks prevented the approach of horsemen errors and accidents had also happened among the pursuers whose task the approaching night rendered every moment more hopeless some got themselves involved in the eddies of the stream and required the assistance of their companions to save them from drowning others hurt by shots or blows in the confused melee implored help or threatened vengeance and in one or two instances such accidents led to actual strife the trumpets therefore sounded the retreat announcing that the commanding officer with whatsoever unwillingness had for the present relinquished hopes of the important prize which had thus unexpectedly escaped his grasp and the troopers began slowly reluctantly and brawling with each other as they returned again to assume their ranks i could see them darkening as they formed on the southern bank of the river whose murmurs long drowned by the louder cries of vengeful pursuit were now heard hoarsely mingling with the deep discontented and reproachful voices of the disappointed horsemen hitherto i had been as it were a mere spectator though far from an uninterested one of the singular scene which had passed but now i heard a voice suddenly exclaim where is the english stranger it was he gave rob roy the knife to cut the belt cleeve the pockpudding to the chafts cried one voice weize a brace of balls through his harnpan said a second drive three inches of cauld airn into his brisket shouted a third and i heard several horses galloping to and fro with the kind purpose doubtless of executing these denunciations i was immediately awakened to the sense of my situation and to the certainty that armed men having no restraint whatever on their irritated and inflamed passions would probably begin by shooting or cutting me down and afterwards investigate the justice of the action impressed by this belief i leaped from my horse and turning him loose plunged into a bush of aldertrees where considering the advancing obscurity of the night i thought there was little chance of my being discovered had i been near enough to the duke to have invoked his personal protection i would have done so but he had already commenced his retreat and i saw no officer on the left bank of the river of authority sufficient to have afforded protection in case of my surrendering myself i thought there was no point of honour which could require in such circumstances an unnecessary exposure of my life my first idea when the tumult began to be appeased and the clatter of the horses feet was heard less frequently in the immediate vicinity of my hidingplace was to seek out the dukes quarters when all should be quiet and give myself up to him as a liege subject who had nothing to fear from his justice and a stranger who had every right to expect protection and hospitality with this purpose i crept out of my hidingplace and looked around me the twilight had now melted nearly into darkness a few or none of the troopers were left on my side of the forth and of those who were already across it i only heard the distant trample of the horses feet and the wailing and prolonged sound of their trumpets which rung through the woods to recall stragglers here therefore i was left in a situation of considerable difficulty i had no horse and the deep and wheeling stream of the river rendered turbid by the late tumult of which its channel had been the scene and seeming yet more so under the doubtful influence of an imperfect moonlight had no inviting influence for a pedestrian by no means accustomed to wade rivers and who had lately seen horsemen weltering in this dangerous passage up to the very saddlelaps at the same time my prospect if i remained on the side of the river on which i then stood could be no other than of concluding the various fatigues of this day and the preceding night by passing that which was now closing in al fresco on the side of a highland hill after a moments reflection i began to consider that fairservice who had doubtless crossed the river with the other domestics according to his forward and impertinent custom of putting himself always among the foremost could not fail to satisfy the duke or the competent authorities respecting my rank and situation and that therefore my character did not require my immediate appearance at the risk of being drowned in the river of being unable to trace the march of the squadron in case of my reaching the other side in safety or finally of being cut down right or wrong by some straggler who might think such a piece of good service a convenient excuse for not sooner rejoining his ranks i therefore resolved to measure my steps back to the little inn where i had passed the preceding night i had nothing to apprehend from rob roy he was now at liberty and i was certain in case of my falling in with any of his people the news of his escape would ensure me protection i might thus also show that i had no intention to desert mr jarvie in the delicate situation in which he had engaged himself chiefly on my account and lastly it was only in this quarter that i could hope to learn tidings concerning rashleigh and my fathers papers which had been the original cause of an expedition so fraught with perilous adventure i therefore abandoned all thoughts of crossing the forth that evening and turning my back on the fords of frew began to retrace my steps towards the little village of aberfoil a sharp frostwind which made itself heard and felt from time to time removed the clouds of mist which might otherwise have slumbered till morning on the valley and though it could not totally disperse the clouds of vapour yet threw them in confused and changeful masses now hovering round the heads of the mountains now filling as with a dense and voluminous stream of smoke the various deep gullies where masses of the composite rock or breccia tumbling in fragments from the cliffs have rushed to the valley leaving each behind its course a rent and torn ravine resembling a deserted watercourse the moon which was now high and twinkled with all the vivacity of a frosty atmosphere silvered the windings of the river and the peaks and precipices which the mist left visible while her beams seemed as it were absorbed by the fleecy whiteness of the mist where it lay thick and condensed and gave to the more light and vapoury specks which were elsewhere visible a sort of filmy transparency resembling the lightest veil of silver gauze despite the uncertainty of my situation a view so romantic joined to the active and inspiring influence of the frosty atmosphere elevated my spirits while it braced my nerves i felt an inclination to cast care away and bid defiance to danger and involuntarily whistled by way of cadence to my steps which my feeling of the cold led me to accelerate and i felt the pulse of existence beat prouder and higher in proportion as i felt confidence in my own strength courage and resources i was so much lost in these thoughts and in the feelings which they excited that two horsemen came up behind me without my hearing their approach until one was on each side of me when the lefthand rider pulling up his horse addressed me in the english tongue so ho friend whither so late to my supper and bed at aberfoil i replied are the passes open he inquired with the same commanding tone of voice i do not know i replied i shall learn when i get there but i added the fate of morris recurring to my recollection if you are an english stranger i advise you to turn back till daylight there has been some disturbance in this neighbourhood and i should hesitate to say it is perfectly safe for strangers the soldiers had the worst had they not was the reply they had indeed and an officers party were destroyed or made prisoners are you sure of that replied the horseman as sure as that i hear you speak i replied i was an unwilling spectator of the skirmish unwilling continued the interrogator were you not engaged in it then certainly no i replied i was detained by the kings officer on what suspicion and who are you or what is your name he continued i really do not know sir said i why i should answer so many questions to an unknown stranger i have told you enough to convince you that you are going into a dangerous and distracted country if you choose to proceed it is your own affair but as i ask you no questions respecting your name and business you will oblige me by making no inquiries after mine mr francis osbaldistone said the other rider in a voice the tones of which thrilled through every nerve of my body should not whistle his favourite airs when he wishes to remain undiscovered and diana vernon for she wrapped in a horsemans cloak was the last speaker whistled in playful mimicry the second part of the tune which was on my lips when they came up good god i exclaimed like one thunderstruck can it be you miss vernon on such a spot at such an hour in such a lawless country in such in such a masculine dress you would say but what would you have the philosophy of the excellent corporal nym is the best after all things must be as they may pauca verba while she was thus speaking i eagerly took advantage of an unusually bright gleam of moonshine to study the appearance of her companion for it may be easily supposed that finding miss vernon in a place so solitary engaged in a journey so dangerous and under the protection of one gentleman only were circumstances to excite every feeling of jealousy as well as surprise the rider did not speak with the deep melody of rashleighs voice his tones were more high and commanding he was taller moreover as he sate on horseback than that firstrate object of my hate and suspicion neither did the strangers address resemble that of any of my other cousins it had that indescribable tone and manner by which we recognise a man of sense and breeding even in the first few sentences he speaks the object of my anxiety seemed desirous to get rid of my investigation diana he said in a tone of mingled kindness and authority give your cousin his property and let us not spend time here miss vernon had in the meantime taken out a small case and leaning down from her horse towards me she said in a tone in which an effort at her usual quaint lightness of expression contended with a deeper and more grave tone of sentiment you see my dear coz i was born to be your better angel rashleigh has been compelled to yield up his spoil and had we reached this same village of aberfoil last night as we purposed i should have found some highland sylph to have wafted to you all these representatives of commercial wealth but there were giants and dragons in the way and errantknights and damsels of modern times bold though they be must not as of yore run into useless danger do not you do so either my dear coz diana said her companion let me once more warn you that the evening waxes late and we are still distant from our home i am coming sir i am coming consider she added with a sigh how lately i have been subjected to control besides i have not yet given my cousin the packet and bid him farewell for ever yes frank she said for ever there is a gulf between us a gulf of absolute perdition where we go you must not follow what we do you must not share in farewell be happy illustration parting of die and frank on the moor in the attitude in which she bent from her horse which was a highland pony her face not perhaps altogether unwillingly touched mine she pressed my hand while the tear that trembled in her eye found its way to my cheek instead of her own it was a moment never to be forgotten inexpressibly bitter yet mixed with a sensation of pleasure so deeply soothing and affecting as at once to unlock all the floodgates of the heart it was but a moment however for instantly recovering from the feeling to which she had involuntarily given way she intimated to her companion she was ready to attend him and putting their horses to a brisk pace they were soon far distant from the place where i stood heaven knows it was not apathy which loaded my frame and my tongue so much that i could neither return miss vernons half embrace nor even answer her farewell the word though it rose to my tongue seemed to choke in my throat like the fatal guilty which the delinquent who makes it his plea knows must be followed by the doom of death the surprise the sorrow almost stupified me i remained motionless with the packet in my hand gazing after them as if endeavouring to count the sparkles which flew from the horses hoofs i continued to look after even these had ceased to be visible and to listen for their footsteps long after the last distant trampling had died in my ears at length tears rushed to my eyes glazed as they were by the exertion of straining after what was no longer to be seen i wiped them mechanically and almost without being aware that they were flowing but they came thicker and thicker i felt the tightening of the throat and breast the hysterica passio of poor lear and sitting down by the wayside i shed a flood of the first and most bitter tears which had flowed from my eyes since childhood chapter seventeen dangle egad i think the interpreter is the harder to be understood of the two critic i had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm ere was ashamed of my weakness i remembered that i had been for some time endeavouring to regard diana vernon when her idea intruded itself on my remembrance as a friend for whose welfare i should indeed always be anxious but with whom i could have little further communication but the almost unrepressed tenderness of her manner joined to the romance of our sudden meeting where it was so little to have been expected were circumstances which threw me entirely off my guard i recovered however sooner than might have been expected and without giving myself time accurately to examine my motives i resumed the path on which i had been travelling when overtaken by this strange and unexpected apparition i am not was my reflection transgressing her injunction so pathetically given since i am but pursuing my own journey by the only open route if i have succeeded in recovering my fathers property it still remains incumbent on me to see my glasgow friend delivered from the situation in which he has involved himself on my account besides what other place of rest can i obtain for the night excepting at the little inn of aberfoil they also must stop there since it is impossible for travellers on horseback to go farther well then we shall meet again meet for the last time perhaps but i shall see and hear her i shall learn who this happy man is who exercises over her the authority of a husband i shall learn if there remains in the difficult course in which she seems engaged any difficulty which my efforts may remove or aught that i can do to express my gratitude for her generosity for her disinterested friendship as i reasoned thus with myself colouring with every plausible pretext which occurred to my ingenuity my passionate desire once more to see and converse with my cousin i was suddenly hailed by a touch on the shoulder and the deep voice of a highlander who walking still faster than i though i was proceeding at a smart pace accosted me with a braw night maister osbaldistone we have met at the mirk hour before now there was no mistaking the tone of macgregor he had escaped the pursuit of his enemies and was in full retreat to his own wilds and to his adherents he had also contrived to arm himself probably at the house of some secret adherent for he had a musket on his shoulder and the usual highland weapons by his side to have found myself alone with such a character in such a situation and at this late hour in the evening might not have been pleasant to me in any ordinary mood of mind for though habituated to think of rob roy in rather a friendly point of view i will confess frankly that i never heard him speak but that it seemed to thrill my blood the intonation of the mountaineers gives a habitual depth and hollowness to the sound of their words owing to the guttural expression so common in their native language and they usually speak with a good deal of emphasis to these national peculiarities rob roy added a sort of hard indifference of accent and manner expressive of a mind neither to be daunted nor surprised nor affected by what passed before him however dreadful however sudden however afflicting habitual danger with unbounded confidence in his own strength and sagacity had rendered him indifferent to fear and the lawless and precarious life he led had blunted though its dangers and errors had not destroyed his feelings for others and it was to be remembered that i had very lately seen the followers of this man commit a cruel slaughter on an unarmed and suppliant individual yet such was the state of my mind that i welcomed the company of the outlaw leader as a relief to my own overstrained and painful thoughts and was not without hopes that through his means i might obtain some clew of guidance through the maze in which my fate had involved me i therefore answered his greeting cordially and congratulated him on his late escape in circumstances when escape seemed impossible ay he replied there is as much between the craig and the woodie as there is between the cup and the lip but my peril was less than you may think being a stranger to this country ie the throat and the withy twigs of willow such as bind faggots were often used for halters in scotland and ireland being a sage economy of hemp of those that were summoned to take me and to keep me and to retake me again there was a moiety as cousin nicol jarvie calls it that had nae will that i suld be either taen or keepit fast or retaen and of tother moiety there was as half was feared to stir me and so i had only like the fourth part of fifty or sixty men to deal withal and enough too i should think replied i i dinna ken that said he but i ken that turn every illwiller that i had amang them out upon the green before the clachan of aberfoil i wad find them play with broadsword and target one down and another come on he now inquired into my adventures since we entered his country and laughed heartily at my account of the battle we had in the inn and at the exploits of the bailie with the redhot poker let glasgow flourish he exclaimed the curse of cromwell on me if i wad hae wished better sport than to see cousin nicol jarvie singe iverachs plaid like a sheeps head between a pair of tongs but my cousin jarvie he added more gravely has some gentlemans bluid in his veins although he has been unhappily bred up to a peaceful and mechanical craft which could not but blunt any pretty mans spirit ye may estimate the reason why i could not receive you at the clachan of aberfoil as i purposed they had made a fine hosenet for me when i was absent twa or three days at glasgow upon the kings business but i think i broke up the league about their lugs theyll no be able to hound one clan against another as they hae dune i hope soon to see the day when a hielandmen will stand shouther to shouther but what chanced next i gave him an account of the arrival of captain thornton and his party and the arrest of the bailie and myself under pretext of our being suspicious persons and upon his more special inquiry i recollected the officer had mentioned that besides my name sounding suspicious in his ears he had orders to secure an old and young person resembling our description this again moved the outlaws risibility as man lives by bread he said the buzzards have mistaen my friend the bailie for his excellency and you for diana vernon o the most egregious nighthowlets miss vernon said i with hesitation and trembling for the answer does she still bear that name she passed but now along with a gentleman who seemed to use a style of authority ay ay answered rob shes under lawfu authority now and full time for she was a daft hempie but shes a mettle quean its a pity his excellency is a thought eldern the like o yourself or my son hamish wad be mair sortable in point of years here then was a complete downfall of those castles of cards which my fancy had in despite of my reason so often amused herself with building although in truth i had scarcely anything else to expect since i could not suppose that diana could be travelling in such a country at such an hour with any but one who had a legal title to protect her i did not feel the blow less severely when it came and macgregors voice urging me to pursue my story sounded in my ears without conveying any exact import to my mind you are ill he said at length after he had spoken twice without receiving an answer this days wark has been ower muckle for ane doubtless unused to sic things the tone of kindness in which this was spoken recalling me to myself and to the necessities of my situation i continued my narrative as well as i could rob roy expressed great exultation at the successful skirmish in the pass they say he observed that kings chaff is better than other folks corn but i think that canna be said o kings soldiers if they let themselves be beaten wi a wheen auld carles that are past fighting and bairns that are no come tillt and wives wi their rocks and distaffs the very wallydraigles o the countryside and dougal gregor too wha wad hae thought there had been as muckle sense in his tattypow that neer had a better covering than his ain shaggy hassock of hair but say away though i dread whats to come neist for my helens an incarnate devil when her bluids up puir thing she has ower muckle reason i observed as much delicacy as i could in communicating to him the usage we had received but i obviously saw the detail gave him great pain i wad rather than a thousand merks he said that i had been at hame to misguide strangers and forbye a my ain natural cousin that had showed me sic kindness i wad rather they had burned half the lennox in their folly but this comes o trusting women and their bairns that have neither measure nor reason in their dealings however its a owing to that dog of a gauger wha betrayed me by pretending a message from your cousin rashleigh to meet him on the kings affairs whilk i thought was very like to be anent garschattachin and a party of the lennox declaring themselves for king james faith but i kend i was clean beguiled when i heard the duke was there and when they strapped the horsegirth ower my arms i might hae judged what was biding me for i kend your kinsman being wi pardon a slippery loon himself is prone to employ those of his ain kidney i wish he mayna hae been at the bottom o the ploy himsell i thought the chield morris looked devilish queer when i determined he should remain a wad or hostage for my safe backcoming but i am come back nae thanks to him or them that employed him and the question is how the collector loon is to win back himsell i promise him it will not be without a ransom morris said i has already paid the last ransom which mortal man can owe eh what exclaimed my companion hastily what dye say i trust it was in the skirmish he was killed he was slain in cold blood after the fight was over mr campbell cold blood damnation he said muttering betwixt his teeth how fell that sir speak out sir and do not maister or campbell me my foot is on my native heath and my name is macgregor his passions were obviously irritated but without noticing the rudeness of his tone i gave him a short and distinct account of the death of morris he struck the butt of his gun with great vehemence against the ground and broke out i vow to god such a deed might make one forswear kin clan country wife and bairns and yet the villain wrought long for it and what is the difference between warsling below the water wi a stane about your neck and wavering in the wind wi a tether round it its but choking after a and he drees the doom he ettled for me i could have wished though they had rather putten a ball through him or a dirk for the fashion of removing him will give rise to mony idle clavers but every wight has his weird and we maun a dee when our day comes and naebody will deny that helen macgregor has deep wrongs to avenge so saying he seemed to dismiss the theme altogether from his mind and proceeded to inquire how i got free from the party in whose hands he had seen me my story was soon told and i added the episode of my having recovered the papers of my father though i dared not trust my voice to name the name of diana i was sure ye wad get them said macgregor the letter ye brought me contained his excellencys pleasure to that effect and nae doubt it was my will to have aided in it and i asked ye up into this glen on the very errand but its like his excellency has foregathered wi rashleigh sooner than i expected the first part of this answer was what most forcibly struck me was the letter i brought you then from this person you call his excellency who is he and what is his rank and proper name i am thinking said macgregor that since ye dinna ken them already they canna be o muckle consequence to you and sae i shall say naething on that score but weel i wot the letter was frae his ain hand or having a sort of business of my ain on my hands being as ye weel may see just as much as i can fairly manage i canna say i would hae fashed mysell sae muckle about the matter i now recollected the lights seen in the library the various circumstances which had excited my jealousy the glove the agitation of the tapestry which covered the secret passage from rashleighs apartment and above all i recollected that diana retired in order to write as i then thought the billet to which i was to have recourse in case of the last necessity her hours then were not spent in solitude but in listening to the addresses of some desperate agent of jacobitical treason who was a secret resident within the mansion of her uncle other young women have sold themselves for gold or suffered themselves to be seduced from their first love from vanity but diana had sacrificed my affections and her own to partake the fortunes of some desperate adventurer to seek the haunts of freebooters through midnight deserts with no better hopes of rank or fortune than that mimicry of both which the mock court of the stuarts at st germains had in their power to bestow i will see her i said internally if it be possible once more i will argue with her as a friend as a kinsman on the risk she is incurring and i will facilitate her retreat to france where she may with more comfort and propriety as well as safety abide the issue of the turmoils which the political trepanner to whom she has united her fate is doubtless busied in putting into motion i conclude then i said to macgregor after about five minutes silence on both sides that his excellency since you give me no other name for him was residing in osbaldistone hall at the same time with myself to be sure to be sure and in the young ladys apartment as best reason was this gratuitous information was adding gall to bitterness but few added macgregor kend he was derned there save rashleigh and sir hildebrand for you were out o the question and the young lads haena wit eneugh to ca the cat frae the cream but its a bra auldfashioned house and what i specially admire is the abundance o holes and bores and concealments ye could put twenty or thirty men in ae corner and a family might live a week without finding them out whilk nae doubt may on occasion be a special convenience i wish we had the like o osbaldistone hall on the braes o craigroyston but we maun gar woods and caves serve the like o us puir hieland bodies i suppose his excellency said i was privy to the first accident which befell i could not help hesitating a moment ye were going to say morris said rob roy coolly for he was too much accustomed to deeds of violence for the agitation he had at first expressed to be of long continuance i used to laugh heartily at that reik but ill hardly hae the heart to dot again since the illfard accident at the loch na na his excellency kend nought o that ploy it was a managed atween rashleigh and mysell but the sport that came after and rashleighs shift o turning the suspicion aff himself upon you that he had nae grit favour to frae the beginning and then miss die she maun hae us sweep up a our spiders webs again and set you out o the justices claws and then the frightened craven morris that was scared out o his seven senses by seeing the real man when he was charging the innocent stranger and the gowk of a clerk and the drunken carle of a justice ohon ohon mony a laugh that jobs gien me and now a that i can do for the puir devil is to get some messes said for his soul may i ask said i how miss vernon came to have so much influence over rashleigh and his accomplices as to derange your projected plan mine it was none of mine no man can say i ever laid my burden on other folks shoulders it was a rashleighs doings but undoubtedly she had great influence wi us baith on account of his excellencys affection as weel as that she kend far ower mony secrets to be lightlied in a matter o that kind deil tak him he ejaculated by way of summing up that gies women either secret to keep or power to abuse fules shouldna hae chappingsticks we were now within a quarter of a mile from the village when three highlanders springing upon us with presented arms commanded us to stand and tell our business the single word gregaragh in the deep and commanding voice of my companion was answered by a shout or rather yell of joyful recognition one throwing down his firelock clasped his leader so fast round the knees that he was unable to extricate himself muttering at the same time a torrent of gaelic gratulation which every now and then rose into a sort of scream of gladness the two others after the first howling was over set off literally with the speed of deers contending which should first carry to the village which a strong party of the macgregors now occupied the joyful news of rob roys escape and return the intelligence excited such shouts of jubilation that the very hills rung again and young and old men women and children without distinction of sex or age came running down the vale to meet us with all the tumultuous speed and clamour of a mountain torrent when i heard the rushing noise and yells of this joyful multitude approach us i thought it a fitting precaution to remind macgregor that i was a stranger and under his protection he accordingly held me fast by the hand while the assemblage crowded around him with such shouts of devoted attachment and joy at his return as were really affecting nor did he extend to his followers what all eagerly sought the grasp namely of his hand until he had made them understand that i was to be kindly and carefully used the mandate of the sultan of delhi could not have been more promptly obeyed indeed i now sustained nearly as much inconvenience from their wellmeant attentions as formerly from their rudeness they would hardly allow the friend of their leader to walk upon his own legs so earnest were they in affording me support and assistance upon the way and at length taking advantage of a slight stumble which i made over a stone which the press did not permit me to avoid they fairly seized upon me and bore me in their arms in triumph towards mrs macalpines on arrival before her hospitable wigwam i found power and popularity had its inconveniences in the highlands as everywhere else for before macgregor could be permitted to enter the house where he was to obtain rest and refreshment he was obliged to relate the story of his escape at least a dozen times over as i was told by an officious old man who chose to translate it at least as often for my edification and to whom i was in policy obliged to seem to pay a decent degree of attention the audience being at length satisfied group after group departed to take their bed upon the heath or in the neighbouring huts some cursing the duke and garschattachin some lamenting the probable danger of ewan of brigglands incurred by his friendship to macgregor but all agreeing that the escape of rob roy himself lost nothing in comparison with the exploit of any one of their chiefs since the days of dougal ciar the founder of his line the friendly outlaw now taking me by the arm conducted me into the interior of the hut my eyes roved round its smoky recesses in quest of diana and her companion but they were nowhere to be seen and i felt as if to make inquiries might betray some secret motives which were best concealed the only known countenance upon which my eyes rested was that of the bailie who seated on a stool by the fireside received with a sort of reserved dignity the welcomes of rob roy the apologies which he made for his indifferent accommodation and his inquiries after his health i am pretty weel kinsman said the bailie indifferent weel i thank ye and for accommodations ane canna expect to carry about the saut market at his tail as a snail does his caup and i am blythe that ye hae gotten out o the hands o your unfreends weel weel then answered roy what ist ails ye man as weel that ends weel the warld will last our day come take a cup o brandy your father the deacon could take ane at an orra time it might be he might do sae robin after fatigue whilk has been my lot mair ways than ane this day but he continued slowly filling up a little wooden stoup which might hold about three glasses he was a moderate man of his bicker as i am mysell heres wussing health to ye robin a sip and your weelfare here and hereafter another taste and also to my cousin helen and to your twa hopefu lads of whom mair anon so saying he drank up the contents of the cup with great gravity and deliberation while macgregor winked aside to me as if in ridicule of the air of wisdom and superior authority which the bailie assumed towards him in their intercourse and which he exercised when rob was at the head of his armed clan in full as great or a greater degree than when he was at the bailies mercy in the tolbooth of glasgow it seemed to me that macgregor wished me as a stranger to understand that if he submitted to the tone which his kinsman assumed it was partly out of deference to the rights of hospitality but still more for the jests sake as the bailie set down his cup he recognised me and giving me a cordial welcome on my return he waived farther communication with me for the present i will speak to your matters anon i maun begin as in reason wi those of my kinsman i presume robin theres naebody here will carry aught o what i am gaun to say to the towncouncil or elsewhere to my prejudice or to yours make yourself easy on that head cousin nicol answered macgregor the tae half o the gillies winna ken what ye say and the tother winna care besides that i wad stow the tongue out o the head o any o them that suld presume to say ower again ony speech held wi me in their presence aweel cousin sic being the case and mr osbaldistone here being a prudent youth and a safe friend ise plainly tell ye ye are breeding up your family to gang an ill gate then clearing his voice with a preliminary hem he addressed his kinsman checking as malvolio proposed to do when seated in his state his familiar smile with an austere regard of control ye ken yourself ye haud light by the law and for my cousin helen forbye that her reception o me this blessed day whilk i excuse on account of perturbation of mind was muckle on the north side o friendly i say outputting this personal reason of complaint i hae that to say o your wife say nothing of her kinsman said rob in a grave and stern tone but what is befitting a friend to say and her husband to hear of me you are welcome to say your full pleasure aweel aweel said the bailie somewhat disconcerted wese let that be a passover i dinna approve of making mischief in families but here are your twa sons hamish and robin whilk signifies as im gien to understand james and robert i trust ye will call them sae in future there comes nae gude o hamishes and eachines and angusses except that theyre the names ane aye chances to see in the indictments at the western circuits for cowlifting at the instance of his majestys advocate for his majestys interest aweel but the twa lads as i was saying they haena sae muckle as the ordinar grunds man of liberal education they dinna ken the very multiplication table itself whilk is the root of a usefu knowledge and they did naething but laugh and fleer at me when i tauld them my mind on their ignorance its my belief they can neither read write nor cipher if sic a thing could be believed o anes ain connections in a christian land if they could kinsman said macgregor with great indifference their learning must have come o free will for whar the deil was i to get them a teacher wad ye hae had me put on the gate o your divinity hall at glasgow college wanted a tutor for rob roys bairns na kinsman replied mr jarvie but ye might hae sent the lads whar they could hae learned the fear o god and the usages of civilised creatures they are as ignorant as the kyloes ye used to drive to market or the very english churls that ye sauld them to and can do naething whatever to purpose umph answered rob hamish can bring doun a blackcock when hes on the wing wi a single bullet and rob can drive a dirk through a twainch board sae muckle the waur for them cousin sae muckle the waur for them baith answered the glasgow merchant in a tone of great decision an they ken naething better than that they had better no ken that neither tell me yourself rob what has a this cutting and stabbing and shooting and driving of dirks whether through human flesh or fir deals dune for yourself and werena ye a happier man at the tail o your nowtebestial when ye were in an honest calling than ever ye hae been since at the head o your hieland kernes and gallyglasses i observed that macgregor while his wellmeaning kinsman spoke to him in this manner turned and writhed his body like a man who indeed suffers pain but is determined no groan shall escape his lips and i longed for an opportunity to interrupt the wellmeant but as it was obvious to me quite mistaken strain in which jarvie addressed this extraordinary person the dialogue however came to an end without my interference and sae said the bailie i hae been thinking rob that as it may be ye are ower deep in the black book to win a pardon and ower auld to mend yourself that it wad be a pity to bring up twa hopefu lads to sic a godless trade as your ain and i wad blythely tak them for prentices at the loom as i began mysell and my father the deacon afore me though praise to the giver i only trade now as wholesale dealer and and he saw a storm gathering on robs brow which probably induced him to throw in as a sweetener of an obnoxious proposition what he had reserved to crown his own generosity had it been embraced as an acceptable one and robin lad ye needna look sae glum for ill pay the prenticefee and never plague ye for the thousand merks neither ceade millia diaoul hundred thousand devils exclaimed rob rising and striding through the hut my sons weavers millia molligheart but i wad see every loom in glasgow beam traddles and shuttles burnt in hellfire sooner with some difficulty i made the bailie who was preparing a reply comprehend the risk and impropriety of pressing our host on this topic and in a minute he recovered or reassumed his serenity of temper but ye mean weel ye mean weel said he so gie me your hand nicol and if ever i put my sons apprentice i will gie you the refusal o them and as you say theres the thousand merks to be settled between us here eachin macanaleister bring me my sporran the person he addressed a tall strong mountaineer who seemed to act as macgregors lieutenant brought from some place of safety a large leathern pouch such as highlanders of rank wear before them when in full dress made of the skin of the seaotter richly garnished with silver ornaments and studs i advise no man to attempt opening this sporran till he has my secret said rob roy and then twisting one button in one direction and another in another pulling one stud upward and pressing another downward the mouth of the purse which was bound with massive silver plate opened and gave admittance to his hand he made me remark as if to break short the subject on which bailie jarvie had spoken that a small steel pistol was concealed within the purse the trigger of which was connected with the mounting and made part of the machinery so that the weapon would certainly be discharged and in all probability its contents lodged in the person of any one who being unacquainted with the secret should tamper with the lock which secured his treasure this said he touching the pistol this is the keeper of my privy purse the simplicity of the contrivance to secure a furred pouch which could have been ripped open without any attempt on the spring reminded me of the verses in the odyssey where ulysses in a yet ruder age is content to secure his property by casting a curious and involved complication of cordage around the seachest in which it was deposited the bailie put on his spectacles to examine the mechanism and when he had done returned it with a smile and a sigh observing ah rob had ither folks purses been as weel guarded i doubt if your sporran wad hae been as weel filled as it kythes to be by the weight never mind kinsman said rob laughing it will aye open for a friends necessity or to pay a just due and here he added pulling out a rouleau of gold here is your ten hundred merks count them and see that you are full and justly paid mr jarvie took the money in silence and weighing it in his hand for an instant laid it on the table and replied rob i canna tak it i downa intromit with it there can nae gude come ot i hae seen ower weel the day what sort of a gate your gowd is made in illgot gear neer prospered and to be plain wi you i winna meddle wit it looks as there might be bluid ont troutsho said the outlaw affecting an indifference which perhaps he did not altogether feel its gude french gowd and neer was in scotchmans pouch before mine look at them man they are a louisdors bright and bonnie as the day they were coined the waur the waur just sae muckle the waur robin replied the bailie averting his eyes from the money though like caesar on the lupercal his fingers seemed to itch for it rebellion is waur than witchcraft or robbery either theres gospel warrant fort never mind the warrant kinsman said the freebooter you come by the gowd honestly and in payment of a just debt it came from the one king you may gie it to the other if ye like and it will just serve for a weakening of the enemy and in the point where puir king james is weakest too for god knows he has hands and hearts eneugh but i doubt he wants the siller hell no get mony hielanders then robin said mr jarvie as again replacing his spectacles on his nose he undid the rouleau and began to count its contents nor lowlanders neither said macgregor arching his eyebrow and as he looked at me directing a glance towards mr jarvie who all unconscious of the ridicule weighed each piece with habitual scrupulosity and having told twice over the sum which amounted to the discharge of his debt principal and interest he returned three pieces to buy his kinswoman a gown as he expressed himself and a brace more for the twa bairns as he called them requesting they might buy anything they liked with them except gunpowder the highlander stared at his kinsmans unexpected generosity but courteously accepted his gift which he deposited for the time in his wellsecured pouch the bailie next produced the original bond for the debt on the back of which he had written a formal discharge which having subscribed himself he requested me to sign as a witness i did so and bailie jarvie was looking anxiously around for another the scottish law requiring the subscription of two witnesses to validate either a bond or acquittance you will hardly find a man that can write save ourselves within these three miles said rob but ill settle the matter as easily and taking the paper from before his kinsman he threw it in the fire bailie jarvie stared in his turn but his kinsman continued thats a hieland settlement of accounts the time might come cousin were i to keep a these charges and discharges that friends might be brought into trouble for having dealt with me the bailie attempted no reply to this argument and our supper now appeared in a style of abundance and even delicacy which for the place might be considered as extraordinary the greater part of the provisions were cold intimating they had been prepared at some distance and there were some bottles of good french wine to relish pasties of various sorts of game as well as other dishes i remarked that macgregor while doing the honours of the table with great and anxious hospitality prayed us to excuse the circumstance that some particular dish or pasty had been infringed on before it was presented to us you must know said he to mr jarvie but without looking towards me you are not the only guests this night in the macgregors country whilk doubtless ye will believe since my wife and the twa lads would otherwise have been maist ready to attend you as weel beseems them bailie jarvie looked as if he felt glad at any circumstance which occasioned their absence and i should have been entirely of his opinion had it not been that the outlaws apology seemed to imply they were in attendance on diana and her companion whom even in my thoughts i could not bear to designate as her husband while the unpleasant ideas arising from this suggestion counteracted the good effects of appetite welcome and good cheer i remarked that rob roys attention had extended itself to providing us better bedding than we had enjoyed the night before two of the least fragile of the bedsteads which stood by the wall of the hut had been stuffed with heath then in full flower so artificially arranged that the flowers being uppermost afforded a mattress at once elastic and fragrant cloaks and such bedding as could be collected stretched over this vegetable couch made it both soft and warm the bailie seemed exhausted by fatigue i resolved to adjourn my communication to him until next morning and therefore suffered him to betake himself to bed so soon as he had finished a plentiful supper though tired and harassed i did not myself feel the same disposition to sleep but rather a restless and feverish anxiety which led to some farther discourse betwixt me and macgregor chapter eighteenth a hopeless darkness settles oer my fate ive seen the last look of her heavenly eyes ive heard the last sound of her blessed voice ive seen her fair form from my sight depart my doom is closed count basil i ken not what to make of you mr osbaldistone said macgregor as he pushed the flask towards me you eat not you show no wish for rest and yet you drink not though that flask of bourdeaux might have come out of sir hildebrands ain cellar had you been always as abstinent you would have escaped the deadly hatred of your cousin rashleigh had i been always prudent said i blushing at the scene he recalled to my recollection i should have escaped a worse evil the reproach of my own conscience macgregor cast a keen and somewhat fierce glance on me as if to read whether the reproof which he evidently felt had been intentionally conveyed he saw that i was thinking of myself not of him and turned his face towards the fire with a deep sigh i followed his example and each remained for a few minutes wrapt in his own painful reverie all in the hut were now asleep or at least silent excepting ourselves macgregor first broke silence in the tone of one who takes up his determination to enter on a painful subject my cousin nicol jarvie means well he said but he presses ower hard on the temper and situation of a man like me considering what i have been what i have been forced to become and above all that which has forced me to become what i am he paused and though feeling the delicate nature of the discussion in which the conversation was likely to engage me i could not help replying that i did not doubt his present situation had much which must be most unpleasant to his feelings i should be happy to learn i added that there is an honourable chance of your escaping from it you speak like a boy returned macgregor in a low tone that growled like distant thunder like a boy who thinks the auld gnarled oak can be twisted as easily as the young sapling can i forget that i have been branded as an outlaw stigmatised as a traitor a price set on my head as if i had been a wolf my family treated as the dam and cubs of the hillfox whom all may torment vilify degrade and insult the very name which came to me from a long and noble line of martial ancestors denounced as if it were a spell to conjure up the devil with as he went on in this manner i could plainly see that by the enumeration of his wrongs he was lashing himself up into a rage in order to justify in his own eyes the errors they had led him into in this he perfectly succeeded his light grey eyes contracting alternately and dilating their pupils until they seemed actually to flash with flame while he thrust forward and drew back his foot grasped the hilt of his dirk extended his arm clenched his fist and finally rose from his seat and they shall find he said in the same muttered but deep tone of stifled passion that the name they have dared to proscribe that the name of macgregor is a spell to raise the wild devil withal they shall hear of my vengeance that would scorn to listen to the story of my wrongs the miserable highland drover bankrupt barefooted stripped of all dishonoured and hunted down because the avarice of others grasped at more than that poor all could pay shall burst on them in an awful change they that scoffed at the grovelling worm and trode upon him may cry and howl when they see the stoop of the flying and fierymouthed dragon but why do i speak of all this he said sitting down again and in a calmer tone only ye may opine it frets my patience mr osbaldistone to be hunted like an otter or a sealgh or a salmon upon the shallows and that by my very friends and neighbours and to have as many swordcuts made and pistols flashed at me as i had this day in the ford of avondow would try a saints temper much more a highlanders who are not famous for that gude gift as ye may hae heard mr osbaldistone but as thing bides wi me o what nicol said im vexed for the bairns im vexed when i think o hamish and robert living their fathers life and yielding to despondence on account of his sons which he felt not upon his own the father rested his head upon his hand i was much affected will all my life long i have been more melted by the distress under which a strong proud and powerful mind is compelled to give way than by the more easily excited sorrows of softer dispositions the desire of aiding him rushed strongly on my mind notwithstanding the apparent difficulty and even impossibility of the task we have extensive connections abroad said i might not your sons with some assistance and they are well entitled to what my fathers house can give find an honourable resource in foreign service i believe my countenance showed signs of sincere emotion but my companion taking me by the hand as i was going to speak farther said i thank i thank ye but let us say nae mair o this i did not think the eye of man would again have seen a tear on macgregors eyelash he dashed the moisture from his long gray eyelash and shaggy red eyebrow with the back of his hand tomorrow morning he said well talk of this and we will talk too of your affairs for we are early starters in the dawn even when we have the luck to have good beds to sleep in will ye not pledge me in a grace cup i declined the invitation then by the soul of st maronoch i must pledge myself and he poured out and swallowed at least halfaquart of wine i laid myself down to repose resolving to delay my own inquiries until his mind should be in a more composed state indeed so much had this singular man possessed himself of my imagination that i felt it impossible to avoid watching him for some minutes after i had flung myself on my heath mattress to seeming rest he walked up and down the hut crossed himself from time to time muttering over some latin prayer of the catholic church then wrapped himself in his plaid with his naked sword on one side and his pistol on the other so disposing the folds of his mantle that he could start up at a moments warning with a weapon in either hand ready for instant combat in a few minutes his heavy breathing announced that he was fast asleep overpowered by fatigue and stunned by the various unexpected and extraordinary scenes of the day i in my turn was soon overpowered by a slumber deep and overwhelming from which notwithstanding every cause for watchfulness i did not awake until the next morning when i opened my eyes and recollected my situation i found that macgregor had already left the hut i awakened the bailie who after many a snort and groan and some heavy complaints of the soreness of his bones in consequence of the unwonted exertions of the preceding day was at length able to comprehend the joyful intelligence that the assets carried off by rashleigh osbaldistone had been safely recovered the instant he understood my meaning he forgot all his grievances and bustling up in a great hurry proceeded to compare the contents of the packet which i put into his hands with mr owens memorandums muttering as he went on right right the real thing bailie and whittington wheres bailie and whittington seven hundred six and eight exact to a fraction pollock and peelman twentyeight seven exact praise be blest grub and grinder better men cannot be three hundred and seventy gliblad twenty i doubt gliblads ganging slipprytongue slipprytongues gaen but they are smasums smasums the rests aright praise be blest we have got the stuff and may leave this doleful country i shall never think on lochard but the thought will gar me grew again i am sorry cousin said macgregor who entered the hut during the last observation i have not been altogether in the circumstances to make your reception sic as i could have desired natheless if you would condescend to visit my puir dwelling muckle obliged muckle obliged answered mr jarvie very hastily but we maun be ganging we maun be jogging mr osbaldistone and me business canna wait aweel kinsman replied the highlander ye ken our fashion foster the guest that comes further him that maun gang but ye cannot return by drymen i must set you on loch lomond and boat ye down to the ferry o balloch and send your nags round to meet ye there its a maxim of a wise man never to return by the same road he came providing anothers free to him ay ay rob said the bailie thats ane o the maxims ye learned when ye were a drover ye caredna to face the tenants where your beasts had been taking a rug of their moorland grass in the byganging and i doubt your roads waur marked now than it was then the mair need not to travel it ower often kinsman replied rob but ise send round your nags to the ferry wi dougal gregor wha is converted for that purpose into the bailies man coming not as ye may believe from aberfoil or rob roys country but on a quiet jaunt from stirling see here he is i wadna hae kend the creature said mr jarvie nor indeed was it easy to recognise the wild highlander when he appeared before the door of the cottage attired in a hat periwig and ridingcoat which had once called andrew fairservice master and mounted on the bailies horse and leading mine he received his last orders from his master to avoid certain places where he might be exposed to suspicion to collect what intelligence he could in the course of his journey and to await our coming at an appointed place near the ferry of balloch at the same time macgregor invited us to accompany him upon our own road assuring us that we must necessarily march a few miles before breakfast and recommending a dram of brandy as a proper introduction to the journey in which he was pledged by the bailie who pronounced it an unlawful and perilous habit to begin the day wi spirituous liquors except to defend the stomach whilk was a tender part against the morning mist in whilk case his father the deacon had recommended a dram by precept and example very true kinsman replied rob for which reason we who are children of the mist have a right to drink brandy from morning till night the bailie thus refreshed was mounted on a small highland pony another was offered for my use which however i declined and we resumed under very different guidance and auspices our journey of the preceding day our escort consisted of macgregor and five or six of the handsomest best armed and most athletic mountaineers of his band and whom he had generally in immediate attendance upon his own person when we approached the pass the scene of the skirmish of the preceding day and of the still more direful deed which followed it macgregor hastened to speak as if it were rather to what he knew must be necessarily passing in my mind than to any thing i had said he spoke in short to my thoughts and not to my words you must think hardly of us mr osbaldistone and it is not natural that it should be otherwise but remember at least we have not been unprovoked we are a rude and an ignorant and it may be a violent and passionate but we are not a cruel people the land might be at peace and in law for us did they allow us to enjoy the blessings of peaceful law but we have been a persecuted generation and persecution said the bailie maketh wise men mad what must it do then to men like us living as our fathers did a thousand years since and possessing scarce more lights than they did can we view their bluidy edicts against us their hanging heading hounding and hunting down an ancient and honourable name as deserving better treatment than that which enemies give to enemies here i stand have been in twenty frays and never hurt man but when i was in het bluid and yet they wad betray me and hang me like a masterless dog at the gate of ony great man that has an ill will at me i replied that the proscription of his name and family sounded in english ears as a very cruel and arbitrary law and having thus far soothed him i resumed my propositions of obtaining military employment for himself if he chose it and his sons in foreign parts macgregor shook me very cordially by the hand and detaining me so as to permit mr jarvie to precede us a manoeuvre for which the narrowness of the road served as an excuse he said to me you are a kindhearted and an honourable youth and understand doubtless that which is due to the feelings of a man of honour but the heather that i have trode upon when living must bloom ower me when i am dead my heart would sink and my arm would shrink and wither like fern in the frost were i to lose sight of my native hills nor has the world a scene that would console me for the loss of the rocks and cairns wild as they are that you see around us and helen what could become of her were i to leave her the subject of new insult and atrocity or how could she bear to be removed from these scenes where the remembrance of her wrongs is aye sweetened by the recollection of her revenge i was once so hard put at by my great enemy as i may well ca him that i was forced een to gie way to the tide and removed myself and my people and family from our dwellings in our native land and to withdraw for a time into maccallum mores country and helen made a lament on our departure as weel as macrimmon himsell could hae framed it and so piteously sad and waesome that our hearts amaist broke as we sate and listened to her it was like the wailing of one that mourns for the mother that bore him the tears came down the rough faces of our gillies as they hearkened and i wad not have the same touch of heartbreak again no not to have all the lands that ever were owned by macgregor the macrimmons or maccrimonds were hereditary pipers to the chiefs of macleod and celebrated for their talents the pibroch said to have been composed by helen macgregor is still in existence see the introduction to this novel but your sons i said they are at the age when your countrymen have usually no objection to see the world and i should be content he replied that they pushed their fortune in the french or spanish service as is the wont of scottish cavaliers of honour and last night your plan seemed feasible eneugh but i hae seen his excellency this morning before ye were up did he then quarter so near us said i my bosom throbbing with anxiety nearer than ye thought was macgregors reply but he seemed rather in some shape to jalouse your speaking to the young leddy and so you see there was no occasion for jealousy i answered with some haughtiness i should not have intruded on his privacy but ye must not be offended or look out from amang your curls then like a wildcat out of an ivytod for ye are to understand that he wishes most sincere weel to you and has proved it and its partly that whilk has set the heather on fire een now heather on fire said i i do not understand you why resumed macgregor ye ken weel eneugh that women and gear are at the bottom of a the mischief in this warld i hae been misdoubting your cousin rashleigh since ever he saw that he wasna to get die vernon for his marrow and i think he took grudge at his excellency mainly on that account but then came the splore about the surrendering your papers and we hae now gude evidence that sae soon as he was compelled to yield them up he rade post to stirling and tauld the government all and mair than all that was gaun doucely on amang us hillfolk and doubtless that was the way that the country was laid to take his excellency and the leddy and to make sic an unexpected raid on me and i hae as little doubt that the poor deevil morris whom he could gar believe onything was egged on by him and some of the lowland gentry to trepan me in the gate he tried to do but if rashleigh osbaldistone were baith the last and best of his name and granting that he and i ever forgather again the fiend go down my weasand with a bare blade at his belt if we part before my dirk and his best blude are weel acquainted thegither he pronounced the last threat with an ominous frown and the appropriate gesture of his hand upon his dagger i should almost rejoice at what has happened said i could i hope that rashleighs treachery might prove the means of preventing the explosion of the rash and desperate intrigues in which i have long suspected him to be a prime agen trow ye na that said rob roy traitors word never yet hurt honest cause he was ower deep in our secrets thats true and had it not been so stirling and edinburgh castles would have been baith in our hands by this time or briefly hereafter whilk is now scarce to be hoped for but there are ower mony engaged and far ower gude a cause to be gien up for the breath of a traitors tale and that will be seen and heard of ere it be lang and so as i was about to say the best of my thanks to you for your offer anent my sons whilk last night i had some thoughts to have embraced in their behalf but i see that this villains treason will convince our great folks that they must instantly draw to a head and make a blow for it or be taen in their houses coupled up like hounds and driven up to london like the honest noblemen and gentlemen in the year seventeen hundred and seven civil war is like a cockatrice we have sitten hatching the egg that held it for ten years and might hae sitten on for ten years mair when in comes rashleigh and chips the shell and out bangs the wonder amang us and cries to fire and sword now in sic a matter ill hae need o a the hands i can mak and nae disparagement to the kings of france and spain whom i wish very weel to king james is as gude a man as ony o them and has the best right to hamish and rob being his naturalborn subjects i easily comprehended that these words boded a general national convulsion and as it would have been alike useless and dangerous to have combated the political opinions of my guide at such a place and moment i contented myself with regretting the promiscuous scene of confusion and distress likely to arise from any general exertion in favour of the exiled royal family let it come man let it come answered macgregor ye never saw dull weather clear without a shower and if the world is turned upside down why honest men have the better chance to cut bread out of it i again attempted to bring him back to the subject of diana but although on most occasions and subjects he used a freedom of speech which i had no great delight in listening to yet upon that alone which was most interesting to me he kept a degree of scrupulous reserve and contented himself with intimating that he hoped the leddy would be soon in a quieter country than this was like to be for one while i was obliged to be content with this answer and to proceed in the hope that accident might as on a former occasion stand my friend and allow me at least the sad gratification of bidding farewell to the object which had occupied such a share of my affections so much beyond even what i had supposed till i was about to be separated from her for ever illustration loch lomond we pursued the margin of the lake for about six english miles through a devious and beautifully variegated path until we attained a sort of highland farm or assembly of hamlets near the head of that fine sheet of water called if i mistake not lediart or some such name here a numerous party of macgregors men were stationed in order to receive us the taste as well as the eloquence of tribes in a savage or to speak more properly in a rude state is usually just because it is unfettered by system and affectation and of this i had an example in the choice these mountaineers had made of a place to receive their guests it has been said that a british monarch would judge well to receive the embassy of a rival power in the cabin of a manofwar and a highland leader acted with some propriety in choosing a situation where the natural objects of grandeur proper to his country might have their full effect on the minds of his guests we ascended about two hundred yards from the shores of the lake guided by a brawling brook and left on the right hand four or five highland huts with patches of arable land around them so small as to show that they must have been worked with the spade rather than the plough cut as it were out of the surrounding copsewood and waving with crops of barley and oats above this limited space the hill became more steep and on its edge we descried the glittering arms and waving drapery of about fifty of macgregors followers they were stationed on a spot the recollection of which yet strikes me with admiration the brook hurling its waters downwards from the mountain had in this spot encountered a barrier rock over which it had made its way by two distinct leaps the first fall across which a magnificent old oak slanting out from the farther bank partly extended itself as if to shroud the dusky stream of the cascade might be about twelve feet high the broken waters were received in a beautiful stone basin almost as regular as if hewn by a sculptor and after wheeling around its flinty margin they made a second precipitous dash through a dark and narrow chasm at least fifty feet in depth and from thence in a hurried but comparatively a more gentle course escaped to join the lake with the natural taste which belongs to mountaineers and especially to the scottish highlanders whose feelings i have observed are often allied with the romantic and poetical rob roys wife and followers had prepared our morning repast in a scene well calculated to impress strangers with some feelings of awe they are also naturally a grave and proud people and however rude in our estimation carry their ideas of form and politeness to an excess that would appear overstrained except from the demonstration of superior force which accompanies the display of it for it must be granted that the air of punctilious deference and rigid etiquette which would seem ridiculous in an ordinary peasant has like the salute of a corpsdegarde a propriety when tendered by a highlander completely armed there was accordingly a good deal of formality in our approach and reception the highlanders who had been dispersed on the side of the hill drew themselves together when we came in view and standing firm and motionless appeared in close column behind three figures whom i soon recognised to be helen macgregor and her two sons macgregor himself arranged his attendants in the rear and requesting mr jarvie to dismount where the ascent became steep advanced slowly marshalling us forward at the head of the troop as we advanced we heard the wild notes of the bagpipes which lost their natural discord from being mingled with the dashing sound of the cascade when we came close the wife of macgregor came forward to meet us her dress was studiously arranged in a more feminine taste than it had been on the preceding day but her features wore the same lofty unbending and resolute character and as she folded my friend the bailie in an unexpected and apparently unwelcome embrace i could perceive by the agitation of his wig his back and the calves of his legs that he felt much like to one who feels himself suddenly in the gripe of a shebear without being able to distinguish whether the animal is in kindness or in wrath kinsman she said you are welcome and you too stranger she added releasing my alarmed companion who instinctively drew back and settled his wig and addressing herself to me you also are welcome you came she added to our unhappy country when our bloods were chafed and our hands were red excuse the rudeness that gave you a rough welcome and lay it upon the evil times and not upon us all this was said with the manners of a princess and in the tone and style of a court nor was there the least tincture of that vulgarity which we naturally attach to the lowland scottish there was a strong provincial accentuation but otherwise the language rendered by helen macgregor out of the native and poetical gaelic into english which she had acquired as we do learned tongues but had probably never heard applied to the mean purposes of ordinary life was graceful flowing and declamatory her husband who had in his time played many parts used a much less elevated and emphatic dialect but even his language rose in purity of expression as you may have remarked if i have been accurate in recording it when the affairs which he discussed were of an agitating and important nature and it appears to me in his case and in that of some other highlanders whom i have known that when familiar and facetious they used the lowland scottish dialect when serious and impassioned their thoughts arranged themselves in the idiom of their native language and in the latter case as they uttered the corresponding ideas in english the expressions sounded wild elevated and poetical in fact the language of passion is almost always pure as well as vehement and it is no uncommon thing to hear a scotchman when overwhelmed by a countryman with a tone of bitter and fluent upbraiding reply by way of taunt to his adversary you have gotten to your english be this as it may the wife of macgregor invited us to a refreshment spread out on the grass which abounded with all the good things their mountains could offer but was clouded by the dark and undisturbed gravity which sat on the brow of our hostess as well as by our deep and anxious recollection of what had taken place on the preceding day it was in vain that the leader exerted himself to excite mirth a chill hung over our minds as if the feast had been funereal and every bosom felt light when it was ended adieu cousin she said to mr jarvie as we rose from the entertainment the best wish helen macgregor can give to a friend is that he may see her no more the bailie struggled to answer probably with some commonplace maxim of morality but the calm and melancholy sternness of her countenance bore down and disconcerted the mechanical and formal importance of the magistrate he coughed hemmed bowed and was silent for you stranger she said i have a token from one whom you can never helen interrupted macgregor in a loud and stern voice what means this have you forgotten the charge macgregor she replied i have forgotten nought that is fitting for me to remember it is not such hands as these and she stretched forth her long sinewy and bare arm that are fitting to convey lovetokens were the gift connected with aught but misery young man she said presenting me with a ring which i well remembered as one of the few ornaments that miss vernon sometimes wore this comes from one whom you will never see more if it is a joyless token it is well fitted to pass through the hands of one to whom joy can never be known her last words were let him forget me for ever and can she i said almost without being conscious that i spoke suppose that is possible all may be forgotten said the extraordinary female who addressed me all but the sense of dishonour and the desire of vengeance seid suas cried the macgregor stamping with impatience strike up the bagpipes sounded and with their thrilling and jarring tones cut short our conference our leave of our hostess was taken by silent gestures and we resumed our journey with an additional proof on my part that i was beloved by diana and was separated from her for ever chapter nineteenth farewell to the land where the clouds love to rest like the shroud of the dead on the mountains cold breast to the cataracts roar where the eagles reply and the lake her lone bosom expands to the sky our route lay through a dreary yet romantic country which the distress of my own mind prevented me from remarking particularly and which therefore i will not attempt to describe the lofty peak of ben lomond here the predominant monarch of the mountains lay on our right hand and served as a striking landmark i was not awakened from my apathy until after a long and toilsome walk we emerged through a pass in the hills and loch lomond opened before us i will spare you the attempt to describe what you would hardly comprehend without going to see it but certainly this noble lake boasting innumerable beautiful islands of every varying form and outline which fancy can frame its northern extremity narrowing until it is lost among dusky and retreating mountains while gradually widening as it extends to the southward it spreads its base around the indentures and promontories of a fair and fertile land affords one of the most surprising beautiful and sublime spectacles in nature the eastern side peculiarly rough and rugged was at this time the chief seat of macgregor and his clan to curb whom a small garrison had been stationed in a central position betwixt loch lomond and another lake the extreme strength of the country however with the numerous passes marshes caverns and other places of concealment or defence made the establishment of this little fort seem rather an acknowledgment of the danger than an effectual means of securing against it on more than one occasion as well as on that which i witnessed the garrison suffered from the adventurous spirit of the outlaw and his followers these advantages were never sullied by ferocity when he himself was in command for equally goodtempered and sagacious he understood well the danger of incurring unnecessary odium i learned with pleasure that he had caused the captives of the preceding day to be liberated in safety and many traits of mercy and even of generosity are recorded of this remarkable man on similar occasions a boat waited for us in a creek beneath a huge rock manned by four lusty highland rowers and our host took leave of us with great cordiality and even affection betwixt him and mr jarvie indeed there seemed to exist a degree of mutual regard which formed a strong contrast to their different occupations and habits after kissing each other very lovingly and when they were just in the act of parting the bailie in the fulness of his heart and with a faltering voice assured his kinsman that if ever an hundred pund or even twa hundred would put him or his family in a settled way he need but just send a line to the sautmarket and rob grasping his baskethilt with one hand and shaking mr jarvies heartily with the other protested that if ever anybody should affront his kinsman an he would but let him ken he would stow his lugs out of his head were he the best man in glasgow with these assurances of mutual aid and continued goodwill we bore away from the shore and took our course for the southwestern angle of the lake where it gives birth to the river leven rob roy remained for some time standing on the rock from beneath which we had departed conspicuous by his long gun waving tartans and the single plume in his cap which in those days denoted the highland gentleman and soldier although i observe that the present military taste has decorated the highland bonnet with a quantity of black plumage resembling that which is borne before funerals at length as the distance increased between us we saw him turn and go slowly up the side of the hill followed by his immediate attendants or bodyguard we performed our voyage for a long time in silence interrupted only by the gaelic chant which one of the rowers sung in low irregular measure rising occasionally into a wild chorus in which the others joined my own thoughts were sad enough yet i felt something soothing in the magnificent scenery with which i was surrounded and thought in the enthusiasm of the moment that had my faith been that of rome i could have consented to live and die a lonely hermit in one of the romantic and beautiful islands amongst which our boat glided the bailie had also his speculations but they were of somewhat a different complexion as i found when after about an hours silence during which he had been mentally engaged in the calculations necessary he undertook to prove the possibility of draining the lake and giving to plough and harrow many hundred ay many a thousand acres from whilk no man could get earthly gude eenow unless it were a gedd or a dish of perch now and then a pike amidst a long discussion which he crammed into mine ear against the stomach of my sense i only remember that it was part of his project to preserve a portion of the lake just deep enough and broad enough for the purposes of watercarriage so that coalbarges and gabbards should pass as easily between dumbarton and glenfalloch as between glasgow and greenock at length we neared our distant place of landing adjoining to the ruins of an ancient castle and just where the lake discharges its superfluous waters into the leven there we found dougal with the horses the bailie had formed a plan with respect to the creature as well as upon the draining of the lake and perhaps in both cases with more regard to the utility than to the practical possibility of his scheme dougal he said ye are a kindly creature and hae the sense and feeling o what is due to your betters and im een wae for you dougal for it canna be but that in the life ye lead you suld get a jeddart cast ae day suner or later i trust considering my services as a magistrate and my father the deacons afore me i hae interest eneugh in the council to gar them wink a wee at a waur faut than yours the memory of dunbars legal proceedings at jedburgh is preserved in the proverbial phrase jeddart justice which signifies trial after execution minstrelsy of the border preface p lvi sae i hae been thinking that if ye will gang back to glasgow wi us being a strongbackit creature ye might be employed in the warehouse till something better suld cast up her nainsell muckle obliged till the bailies honour replied dougal but teil be in her shanks fan she gangs on a causewayd street unless she be drawn up the gallowgate wi tows as she was before in fact i afterwards learned that dougal had originally come to glasgow as a prisoner from being concerned in some depredation but had somehow found such favour in the eyes of the jailor that with rather overweening confidence he had retained him in his service as one of the turnkeys a task which dougal had discharged with sufficient fidelity so far as was known until overcome by his clannish prejudices on the unexpected appearance of his old leader astonished at receiving so round a refusal to so favourable an offer the bailie turning to me observed that the creature was a naturalborn idiot i testified my own gratitude in a way which dougal much better relished by slipping a couple of guineas into his hand he no sooner felt the touch of the gold than he sprung twice or thrice from the earth with the agility of a wild buck flinging out first one heel and then another in a manner which would have astonished a french dancingmaster he ran to the boatmen to show them the prize and a small gratuity made them take part in his raptures he then to use a favourite expression of the dramatic john bunyan went on his way and i saw him no more the bailie and i mounted our horses and proceeded on the road to glasgow when we had lost the view of the lake and its superb amphitheatre of mountains i could not help expressing with enthusiasm my sense of its natural beauties although i was conscious that mr jarvie was a very uncongenial spirit to communicate with on such a subject ye are a young gentleman he replied and an englishman and a this may be very fine to you but for me wha am a plain man and ken something o the different values of land i wadna gie the finest sight we hae seen in the hielands for the first keek o the gorbals o glasgow and if i were ance there it suldna be every fules errand begging your pardon mr francis that suld take me out o sight o saint mungos steeple again the honest man had his wish for by dint of travelling very late we arrived at his own house that night or rather on the succeeding morning having seen my worthy fellowtraveller safely consigned to the charge of the considerate and officious mattie i proceeded to mrs flyters in whose house even at this unwonted hour light was still burning the door was opened by no less a person than andrew fairservice himself who upon the first sound of my voice set up a loud shout of joyful recognition and without uttering a syllable ran up stairs towards a parlour on the second floor from the windows of which the light proceeded justly conceiving that he went to announce my return to the anxious owen i followed him upon the foot owen was not alone there was another in the apartment it was my father the first impulse was to preserve the dignity of his usual equanimity francis i am glad to see you the next was to embrace me tenderly my dear dear son owen secured one of my hands and wetted it with his tears while he joined in gratulating my return these are scenes which address themselves to the eye and to the heart rather than to the ear my old eyelids still moisten at the recollection of our meeting but your kind and affectionate feelings can well imagine what i should find it impossible to describe when the tumult of our joy was over i learnt that my father had arrived from holland shortly after owen had set off for scotland determined and rapid in all his movements he only stopped to provide the means of discharging the obligations incumbent on his house by his extensive resources with funds enlarged and credit fortified by eminent success in his continental speculation he easily accomplished what perhaps his absence alone rendered difficult and set out for scotland to exact justice from rashleigh osbaldistone as well as to put order to his affairs in that country my fathers arrival in full credit and with the ample means of supporting his engagements honourably as well as benefiting his correspondents in future was a stunning blow to macvittie and company who had conceived his star set for ever highly incensed at the usage his confidential clerk and agent had received at their hands mr osbaldistone refused every tender of apology and accommodation and having settled the balance of their account announced to them that with all its numerous contingent advantages that leaf of their ledger was closed for ever while he enjoyed this triumph over false friends he was not a little alarmed on my account owen good man had not supposed it possible that a journey of fifty or sixty miles which may be made with so much ease and safety in any direction from london could be attended with any particular danger but he caught alarm by sympathy from my father to whom the country and the lawless character of its inhabitants were better known these apprehensions were raised to agony when a few hours before i arrived andrew fairservice made his appearance with a dismal and exaggerated account of the uncertain state in which he had left me the nobleman with whose troops he had been a sort of prisoner had after examination not only dismissed him but furnished him with the means of returning rapidly to glasgow in order to announce to my friends my precarious and unpleasant situation andrew was one of those persons who have no objection to the sort of temporary attention and woeful importance which attaches itself to the bearer of bad tidings and had therefore by no means smoothed down his tale in the telling especially as the rich london merchant himself proved unexpectedly one of the auditors he went at great length into an account of the dangers i had escaped chiefly as he insinuated by means of his own experience exertion and sagacity what was to come of me now when my better angel in his andrews person was removed from my side it was he said sad and sair to conjecture that the bailie was nae better than just naebody at a pinch or something waur for he was a conceited body and andrew hated conceit but certainly atween the pistols and the carabines of the troopers that rappit aff the tane after the tother as fast as hail and the dirks and claymores o the hielanders and the deep waters and weils o the avondow it was to be thought there wad be a puir account of the young gentleman this statement would have driven owen to despair had he been alone and unsupported but my fathers perfect knowledge of mankind enabled him easily to appreciate the character of andrew and the real amount of his intelligence stripped of all exaggeration however it was alarming enough to a parent he determined to set out in person to obtain my liberty by ransom or negotiation and was busied with owen till a late hour in order to get through some necessary correspondence and devolve on the latter some business which should be transacted during his absence and thus it chanced that i found them watchers it was late ere we separated to rest and too impatient long to endure repose i was stirring early the next morning andrew gave his attendance at my levee as in duty bound and instead of the scarecrow figure to which he had been reduced at aberfoil now appeared in the attire of an undertaker a goodly suit namely of the deepest mourning it was not till after one or two queries which the rascal affected as long as he could to misunderstand that i found out he had thought it but decent to put on mourning on account of my inexpressible loss and as the broker at whose shop he had equipped himself declined to receive the goods again and as his own garments had been destroyed or carried off in my honours service doubtless i and my honourable father whom providence had blessed wi the means wadna suffer a puir lad to sit down wi the loss a stand o claes was nae great matter to an osbaldistone be praised fort especially to an old and attached servant o the house as there was something of justice in andrews plea of loss in my service his finesse succeeded and he came by a good suit of mourning with a beaver and all things conforming as the exterior signs of woe for a master who was alive and merry my fathers first care when he arose was to visit mr jarvie for whose kindness he entertained the most grateful sentiments which he expressed in very few but manly and nervous terms he explained the altered state of his affairs and offered the bailie on such terms as could not but be both advantageous and acceptable that part in his concerns which had been hitherto managed by macvittie and company the bailie heartily congratulated my father and owen on the changed posture of their affairs and without affecting to disclaim that he had done his best to serve them when matters looked otherwise he said he had only just acted as he wad be done by that as to the extension of their correspondence he frankly accepted it with thanks had macvitties folk behaved like honest men he said he wad hae liked ill to hae come in ahint them and out afore them this gate but its otherwise and they maun een stand the loss the bailie then pulled me by the sleeve into a corner and after again cordially wishing me joy proceeded in rather an embarrassed tone i wad heartily wish maister francis there suld be as little said as possible about the queer things we saw up yonder awa theres nae gude unless ane were judicially examinate to say onything about that awfu job o morris and the members o the council wadna think it creditable in ane of their body to be fighting wi a wheen hielandmen and singeing their plaidens and abune a though i am a decent sponsible man when i am on my right end i canna but think i maun hae made a queer figure without my hat and my periwig hinging by the middle like bawdrons or a cloak flung ower a cloakpin bailie grahame wad hae an unco hair in my neck an he got that tale by the end i could not suppress a smile when i recollected the bailies situation although i certainly thought it no laughing matter at the time the goodnatured merchant was a little confused but smiled also when he shook his head i see how it is i see how it is but say naething about it theres a gude callant and charge that langtongued conceited upsetting serving man o yours to sae naething neither i wadna for ever sae muckle that even the lassock mattie kend onything about it i wad never hear an end ot he was obviously relieved from his impending fears of ridicule when i told him it was my fathers intention to leave glasgow almost immediately indeed he had now no motive for remaining since the most valuable part of the papers carried off by rashleigh had been recovered for that portion which he had converted into cash and expended in his own or on political intrigues there was no mode of recovering it but by a suit at law which was forthwith commenced and proceeded as our lawagents assured us with all deliberate speed we spent accordingly one hospitable day with the bailie and took leave of him as this narrative now does he continued to grow in wealth honour and credit and actually rose to the highest civic honours in his native city about two years after the period i have mentioned he tired of his bachelor life and promoted mattie from her wheel by the kitchen fire to the upper end of his table in the character of mrs jarvie bailie grahame the macvitties and others for all men have their enemies especially in the council of a royal burgh ridiculed this transformation but said mr jarvie let them say their say ill neer fash mysell nor lose my liking for sae feckless a matter as a nine days clash my honest father the deacon had a byword brent brow and lily skin a loving heart and a leal within is better than gowd or gentle kin besides as he always concluded mattie was nae ordinary lassockquean she was akin to the laird o limmerfield whether it was owing to her descent or her good gifts i do not presume to decide but mattie behaved excellently in her exaltation and relieved the apprehensions of some of the bailies friends who had deemed his experiment somewhat hazardous i do not know that there was any other incident of his quiet and useful life worthy of being particularly recorded chapter twentieth come ye hither my six good sons gallant men i trow ye be how many of you my children dear will stand by that good earl and me five of them did answer make five of them spoke hastily o father till the day we die well stand by that good earl and thee the rising in the north on the morning when we were to depart from glasgow andrew fairservice bounced into my apartment like a madman jumping up and down and singing with more vehemence than tune the kilns on fire the kilns on fire the kilns on fire shes a in a lowe with some difficulty i prevailed on him to cease his confounded clamour and explain to me what the matter was he was pleased to inform me as if he had been bringing the finest news imaginable that the hielands were clean broken out every man o them and that rob roy and a his breekless bands wad be down upon glasgow or twentyfour hours o the clock gaed round hold your tongue said i you rascal you must be drunk or mad and if there is any truth in your news is it a singing matter you scoundrel drunk or mad nae doubt replied andrew dauntlessly anes aye drunk or mad if he tells what grit folks dinna like to hear sing od the clans will make us sing on the wrang side o our mouth if we are sae drunk or mad as to bide their coming i rose in great haste and found my father and owen also on foot and in considerable alarm andrews news proved but too true in the main the great rebellion which agitated britain in the year had already broken out by the unfortunate earl of mars setting up the standard of the stuart family in an illomened hour to the ruin of many honourable families both in england and scotland the treachery of some of the jacobite agents rashleigh among the rest and the arrest of others had made george the firsts government acquainted with the extensive ramifications of a conspiracy long prepared and which at last exploded prematurely and in a part of the kingdom too distant to have any vital effect upon the country which however was plunged into much confusion this great public event served to confirm and elucidate the obscure explanations i had received from macgregor and i could easily see why the westland clans who were brought against him should have waived their private quarrel in consideration that they were all shortly to be engaged in the same public cause it was a more melancholy reflection to my mind that diana vernon was the wife of one of those who were most active in turning the world upside down and that she was herself exposed to all the privations and perils of her husbands hazardous trade we held an immediate consultation on the measures we were to adopt in this crisis and acquiesced in my fathers plan that we should instantly get the necessary passports and make the best of our way to london i acquainted my father with my wish to offer my personal service to the government in any volunteer corps several being already spoken of he readily acquiesced in my proposal for though he disliked war as a profession yet upon principle no man would have exposed his life more willingly in defence of civil and religious liberty we travelled in haste and in peril through dumfriesshire and the neighbouring counties of england in this quarter gentlemen of the tory interest were already in motion mustering men and horses while the whigs assembled themselves in the principal towns armed the inhabitants and prepared for civil war we narrowly escaped being stopped on more occasions than one and were often compelled to take circuitous routes to avoid the points where forces were assembling when we reached london we immediately associated with those bankers and eminent merchants who agreed to support the credit of government and to meet that run upon the funds on which the conspirators had greatly founded their hopes of furthering their undertaking by rendering the government as it were bankrupt my father was chosen one of the members of this formidable body of the monied interest as all had the greatest confidence in his zeal skill and activity he was also the organ by which they communicated with government and contrived from funds belonging to his own house or over which he had command to find purchasers for a quantity of the national stock which was suddenly flung into the market at a depreciated price when the rebellion broke out i was not idle myself but obtained a commission and levied at my fathers expense about two hundred men with whom i joined general carpenters army the rebellion in the meantime had extended itself to england the unfortunate earl of derwentwater had taken arms in the cause along with general foster my poor uncle sir hildebrand whose estate was reduced to almost nothing by his own carelessness and the expense and debauchery of his sons and household was easily persuaded to join that unfortunate standard before doing so however he exhibited a degree of precaution of which no one could have suspected him he made his will by this document he devised his estates at osbaldistone hall and so forth to his sons successively and their male heirs until he came to rashleigh whom on account of the turn he had lately taken in politics he detested with all his might he cut him off with a shilling and settled the estate on me as his next heir i had always been rather a favourite of the old gentleman but it is probable that confident in the number of gigantic youths who now armed around him he considered the destination as likely to remain a dead letter which he inserted chiefly to show his displeasure at rashleighs treachery both public and domestic there was an article by which he bequeathed to the niece of his late wife diana vernon now lady diana vernon beauchamp some diamonds belonging to her late aunt and a great silver ewer having the arms of vernon and osbaldistone quarterly engraven upon it but heaven had decreed a more speedy extinction of his numerous and healthy lineage than most probably he himself had reckoned on in the very first muster of the conspirators at a place called greenrigg thorncliff osbaldistone quarrelled about precedence with a gentleman of the northumbrian border to the full as fierce and intractable as himself in spite of all remonstrances they gave their commander a specimen of how far their discipline might be relied upon by fighting it out with their rapiers and my kinsman was killed on the spot his death was a great loss to sir hildebrand for notwithstanding his infernal temper he had a grain or two of more sense than belonged to the rest of the brotherhood rashleigh always excepted perceval the sot died also in his calling he had a wager with another gentleman who from his exploits in that line had acquired the formidable epithet of brandy swalewell which should drink the largest cup of strong liquor when king james was proclaimed by the insurgents at morpeth the exploit was something enormous i forget the exact quantity of brandy which percie swallowed but it occasioned a fever of which he expired at the end of three days with the word water water perpetually on his tongue dickon broke his neck near warrington bridge in an attempt to show off a foundered bloodmare which he wished to palm upon a manchester merchant who had joined the insurgents he pushed the animal at a fivebarred gate she fell in the leap and the unfortunate jockey lost his life wilfred the fool as sometimes befalls had the best fortune of the family he was slain at proud preston in lancashire on the day that general carpenter attacked the barricades fighting with great bravery though i have heard he was never able exactly to comprehend the cause of quarrel and did not uniformly remember on which kings side he was engaged john also behaved very boldly in the same engagement and received several wounds of which he was not happy enough to die on the spot old sir hildebrand entirely brokenhearted by these successive losses became by the next days surrender one of the unhappy prisoners and was lodged in newgate with his wounded son john i was now released from my military duty and lost no time therefore in endeavouring to relieve the distresses of these new relations my fathers interest with government and the general compassion excited by a parent who had sustained the successive loss of so many sons within so short a time would have prevented my uncle and cousin from being brought to trial for high treason but their doom was given forth from a greater tribunal john died of his wounds in newgate recommending to me in his last breath a cast of hawks which he had at the hall and a black spaniel bitch called lucy my poor uncle seemed beaten down to the very earth by his family calamities and the circumstances in which he unexpectedly found himself he said little but seemed grateful for such attentions as circumstances permitted me to show him i did not witness his meeting with my father for the first time for so many years and under circumstances so melancholy but judging from my fathers extreme depression of spirits it must have been melancholy in the last degree sir hildebrand spoke with great bitterness against rashleigh now his only surviving child laid upon him the ruin of his house and the deaths of all his brethren and declared that neither he nor they would have plunged into political intrigue but for that very member of his family who had been the first to desert them he once or twice mentioned diana always with great affection and once he said while i sate by his bedside nevoy since thorncliff and all of them are dead i am sorry you cannot have her the expression affected me much at the time for it was a usual custom of the poor old baronets when joyously setting forth upon the mornings chase to distinguish thorncliff who was a favourite while he summoned the rest more generally and the loud jolly tone in which he used to hollo call thornie call all of them contrasted sadly with the woebegone and selfabandoning note in which he uttered the disconsolate words which i have above quoted he mentioned the contents of his will and supplied me with an authenticated copy the original he had deposited with my old acquaintance mr justice inglewood who dreaded by no one and confided in by all as a kind of neutral person had become for aught i know the depositary of half the wills of the fighting men of both factions in the county of northumberland the greater part of my uncles last hours were spent in the discharge of the religious duties of his church in which he was directed by the chaplain of the sardinian ambassador for whom with some difficulty we obtained permission to visit him i could not ascertain by my own observation or through the medical attendants that sir hildebrand osbaldistone died of any formed complaint bearing a name in the science of medicine he seemed to me completely worn out and broken down by fatigue of body and distress of mind and rather ceased to exist than died of any positive struggle just as a vessel buffeted and tossed by a succession of tempestuous gales her timbers overstrained and her joints loosened will sometimes spring a leak and founder when there are no apparent causes for her destruction it was a remarkable circumstance that my father after the last duties were performed to his brother appeared suddenly to imbibe a strong anxiety that i should act upon the will and represent his fathers house which had hitherto seemed to be the thing in the world which had least charms for him but formerly he had been like the fox in the fable contemning what was beyond his reach and moreover i doubt not that the excessive dislike which he entertained against rashleigh now sir rashleigh osbaldistone who loudly threatened to attack his father sir hildebrands will and settlement corroborated my fathers desire to maintain it he had been most unjustly disinherited he said by his own father his brothers will had repaired the disgrace if not the injury by leaving the wreck of his property to frank the natural heir and he was determined the bequest should take effect in the meantime rashleigh was not altogether a contemptible personage as an opponent the information he had given to government was critically welltimed and his extreme plausibility with the extent of his intelligence and the artful manner in which he contrived to assume both merit and influence had to a certain extent procured him patrons among ministers we were already in the full tide of litigation with him on the subject of his pillaging the firm of osbaldistone and tresham and judging from the progress we made in that comparatively simple lawsuit there was a chance that this second course of litigation might be drawn out beyond the period of all our natural lives to avert these delays as much as possible my father by the advice of his counsel learned in the law paid off and vested in my person the rights to certain large mortgages affecting osbaldistone hall perhaps however the opportunity to convert a great share of the large profits which accrued from the rapid rise of the funds upon the suppression of the rebellion and the experience he had so lately had of the perils of commerce encouraged him to realise in this manner a considerable part of his property at any rate it so chanced that instead of commanding me to the desk as i fully expected having intimated my willingness to comply with his wishes however they might destine me i received his directions to go down to osbaldistone hall and take possession of it as the heir and representative of the family i was directed to apply to squire inglewood for the copy of my uncles will deposited with him and take all necessary measures to secure that possession which sages say makes nine points of the law at another time i should have been delighted with this change of destination but now osbaldistone hall was accompanied with many painful recollections still however i thought that in that neighbourhood only i was likely to acquire some information respecting the fate of diana vernon i had every reason to fear it must be far different from what i could have wished it but i could obtain no precise information on the subject it was in vain that i endeavoured by such acts of kindness as their situation admitted to conciliate the confidence of some distant relations who were among the prisoners in newgate a pride which i could not condemn and a natural suspicion of the whig frank osbaldistone cousin to the doubledistilled traitor rashleigh closed every heart and tongue and i only received thanks cold and extorted in exchange for such benefits as i had power to offer the arm of the law was also gradually abridging the numbers of those whom i endeavoured to serve and the hearts of the survivors became gradually more contracted towards all whom they conceived to be concerned with the existing government as they were led gradually and by detachments to execution those who survived lost interest in mankind and the desire of communicating with them i shall long remember what one of them ned shafton by name replied to my anxious inquiry whether there was any indulgence i could procure him mr frank osbaldistone i must suppose you mean me kindly and therefore i thank you but by g men cannot be fattened like poultry when they see their neighbours carried off day by day to the place of execution and know that their own necks are to be twisted round in their turn upon the whole therefore i was glad to escape from london from newgate and from the scenes which both exhibited to breathe the free air of northumberland andrew fairservice had continued in my service more from my fathers pleasure than my own at present there seemed a prospect that his local acquaintance with osbaldistone hall and its vicinity might be useful and of course he accompanied me on my journey and i enjoyed the prospect of getting rid of him by establishing him in his old quarters i cannot conceive how he could prevail upon my father to interest himself in him unless it were by the art which he possessed in no inconsiderable degree of affecting an extreme attachment to his master which theoretical attachment he made compatible in practice with playing all manner of tricks without scruple providing only against his master being cheated by any one but himself we performed our journey to the north without any remarkable adventure and we found the country so lately agitated by rebellion now peaceful and in good order the nearer we approached to osbaldistone hall the more did my heart sink at the thought of entering that deserted mansion so that in order to postpone the evil day i resolved first to make my visit at mr justice inglewoods that venerable person had been much disturbed with thoughts of what he had been and what he now was and natural recollections of the past had interfered considerably with the active duty which in his present situation might have been expected from him he was fortunate however in one respect he had got rid of his clerk jobson who had finally left him in dudgeon at his inactivity and become legal assistant to a certain squire standish who had lately commenced operations in those parts as a justice with a zeal for king george and the protestant succession which very different from the feelings of his old patron mr jobson had more occasion to restrain within the bounds of the law than to stimulate to exertion old justice inglewood received me with great courtesy and readily exhibited my uncles will which seemed to be without a flaw he was for some time in obvious distress how he should speak and act in my presence but when he found that though a supporter of the present government upon principle i was disposed to think with pity on those who had opposed it on a mistaken feeling of loyalty and duty his discourse became a very diverting medley of what he had done and what he had left undone the pains he had taken to prevent some squires from joining and to wink at the escape of others who had been so unlucky as to engage in the affair we were teteatete and several bumpers had been quaffed by the justices special desire when on a sudden he requested me to fill a bona fide brimmer to the health of poor dear die vernon the rose of the wilderness the heathbell of cheviot and the blossom thats transplanted to an infernal convent is not miss vernon married then i exclaimed in great astonishment i thought his excellency pooh pooh his excellency and his lordships all a humbug now you know mere st germains titles earl of beauchamp and ambassador plenipotentiary from france when the duke regent of orleans scarce knew that he lived i dare say but you must have seen old sir frederick vernon at the hall when he played the part of father vaughan good heavens then vaughan was miss vernons father to be sure he was said the justice coolly theres no use in keeping the secret now for he must be out of the country by this time otherwise no doubt it would be my duty to apprehend him come off with your bumper to my dear lost die and let her health go round around around and let her health go round for though your stocking be of silk your knees near kiss the ground aground aground this pithy verse occurs it is believed in shadwells play of bury fair i was unable as the reader may easily conceive to join in the justices jollity my head swam with the shock i had received i never heard i said that miss vernons father was living it was not our governments fault that he is replied inglewood for the devil a man there is whose head would have brought more money he was condemned to death for fenwicks plot and was thought to have had some hand in the knightsbridge affair in king williams time and as he had married in scotland a relation of the house of breadalbane he possessed great influence with all their chiefs there was a talk of his being demanded to be given up at the peace of ryswick but he shammed ill and his death was given publicly out in the french papers but when he came back here on the old score we old cavaliers knew him well that is to say i knew him not as being a cavalier myself but no information being lodged against the poor gentleman and my memory being shortened by frequent attacks of the gout i could not have sworn to him you know was he then not known at osbaldistone hall i inquired to none but to his daughter the old knight and rashleigh who had got at that secret as he did at every one else and held it like a twisted cord about poor dies neck i have seen her one hundred times she would have spit at him if it had not been fear for her father whose life would not have been worth five minutes purchase if he had been discovered to the government but dont mistake me mr osbaldistone i say the government is a good a gracious and a just government and if it has hanged onehalf of the rebels poor things all will acknowledge they would not have been touched had they staid peaceably at home waiving the discussion of these political questions i brought back mr inglewood to his subject and i found that diana having positively refused to marry any of the osbaldistone family and expressed her particular detestation of rashleigh he had from that time begun to cool in zeal for the cause of the pretender to which as the youngest of six brethren and bold artful and able he had hitherto looked forward as the means of making his fortune probably the compulsion with which he had been forced to render up the spoils which he had abstracted from my fathers countinghouse by the united authority of sir frederick vernon and the scottish chiefs had determined his resolution to advance his progress by changing his opinions and betraying his trust perhaps also for few men were better judges where his interest was concerned he considered their means and talents to be as they afterwards proved greatly inadequate to the important task of overthrowing an established government sir frederick vernon or as he was called among the jacobites his excellency viscount beauchamp had with his daughter some difficulty in escaping the consequences of rashleighs information here mr inglewoods information was at fault but he did not doubt since we had not heard of sir frederick being in the hands of the government he must be by this time abroad where agreeably to the cruel bond he had entered into with his brotherinlaw diana since she had declined to select a husband out of the osbaldistone family must be confined to a convent the original cause of this singular agreement mr inglewood could not perfectly explain but he understood it was a family compact entered into for the purpose of securing to sir frederick the rents of the remnant of his large estates which had been vested in the osbaldistone family by some legal manoeuvre in short a family compact in which like many of those undertaken at that time of day the feelings of the principal parties interested were no more regarded than if they had been a part of the livestock upon the lands i cannot tell such is the waywardness of the human heart whether this intelligence gave me joy or sorrow it seemed to me that in the knowledge that miss vernon was eternally divided from me not by marriage with another but by seclusion in a convent in order to fulfil an absurd bargain of this kind my regret for her loss was aggravated rather than diminished i became dull lowspirited absent and unable to support the task of conversing with justice inglewood who in his turn yawned and proposed to retire early i took leave of him overnight determining the next day before breakfast to ride over to osbaldistone hall mr inglewood acquiesced in my proposal it would be well he said that i made my appearance there before i was known to be in the country the more especially as sir rashleigh osbaldistone was now he understood at mr jobsons house hatching some mischief doubtless they were fit company he added for each other sir rashleigh having lost all right to mingle in the society of men of honour but it was hardly possible two such d d rascals should collogue together without mischief to honest people he concluded by earnestly recommending a toast and tankard and an attack upon his venison pasty before i set out in the morning just to break the cold air on the words chapter twenty first his masters gone and no one now dwells in the halls of ivor men dogs and horses all are dead he is the sole survivor wordsworth there are few more melancholy sensations than those with which we regard scenes of past pleasure when altered and deserted in my ride to osbaldistone hall i passed the same objects which i had seen in company with miss vernon on the day of our memorable ride from inglewood place her spirit seemed to keep me company on the way and when i approached the spot where i had first seen her i almost listened for the cry of the hounds and the notes of the horn and strained my eye on the vacant space as if to descry the fair huntress again descend like an apparition from the hill but all was silent and all was solitary when i reached the hall the closed doors and windows the grassgrown pavement the courts which were now so silent presented a strong contrast to the gay and bustling scene i had so often seen them exhibit when the merry hunters were going forth to their morning sport or returning to the daily festival the joyous bark of the foxhounds as they were uncoupled the cries of the huntsmen the clang of the horses hoofs the loud laugh of the old knight at the head of his strong and numerous descendants were all silenced now and for ever while i gazed round the scene of solitude and emptiness i was inexpressibly affected even by recollecting those whom when alive i had no reason to regard with affection but the thought that so many youths of goodly presence warm with life health and confidence were within so short a time cold in the grave by various yet all violent and unexpected modes of death afforded a picture of mortality at which the mind trembled it was little consolation to me that i returned a proprietor to the halls which i had left almost like a fugitive my mind was not habituated to regard the scenes around as my property and i felt myself an usurper at least an intruding stranger and could hardly divest myself of the idea that some of the bulky forms of my deceased kinsmen were like the gigantic spectres of a romance to appear in the gateway and dispute my entrance while i was engaged in these sad thoughts my follower andrew whose feelings were of a very different nature exerted himself in thundering alternately on every door in the building calling at the same time for admittance in a tone so loud as to intimate that he at least was fully sensible of his newly acquired importance as squire of the body to the new lord of the manor at length timidly and reluctantly anthony syddall my uncles aged butler and majordomo presented himself at a lower window well fenced with iron bars and inquired our business we are come to tak your charge aff your hand my auld friend said andrew fairservice ye may gie up your keys as sune as ye like ilka dog has his day ill tak the plate and napery aff your hand ye hae had your ain time ot mr syddall but ilka bean has its black and ilka path has its puddle and it will just set you henceforth to sit at the boardend as weel as it did andrew lang syne checking with some difficulty the forwardness of my follower i explained to syddall the nature of my right and the title i had to demand admittance into the hall as into my own property the old man seemed much agitated and distressed and testified manifest reluctance to give me entrance although it was couched in a humble and submissive tone i allowed for the agitation of natural feelings which really did the old man honour but continued peremptory in my demand of admittance explaining to him that his refusal would oblige me to apply for mr inglewoods warrant and a constable we are come from mr justice inglewoods this morning said andrew to enforce the menace and i saw archie rutledge the constable as i came up by the countrys no to be lawless as it has been mr syddall letting rebels and papists gang on as they best listed the threat of the law sounded dreadful in the old mans ears conscious as he was of the suspicion under which he himself lay from his religion and his devotion to sir hildebrand and his sons he undid with fear and trembling one of the postern entrances which was secured with many a bolt and bar and humbly hoped that i would excuse him for fidelity in the discharge of his duty i reassured him and told him i had the better opinion of him for his caution sae have not i said andrew syddall is an auld sneckdrawer he wadna be looking as white as a sheet and his knees knocking thegither unless it were for something mair than hes like to tell us lord forgive you mr fairservice replied the butler to say such things of an old friend and fellowservant where following me humbly along the passage where would it be your honours pleasure to have a fire lighted i fear me you will find the house very dull and dreary but perhaps you mean to ride back to inglewood place to dinner light a fire in the library i replied in the library answered the old man nobody has sat there this many a day and the room smokes for the daws have built in the chimney this spring and there were no young men about the hall to pull them down our ain reekes better than other folks fire said andrew his honour likes the library hes nane o your papishers that delight in blinded ignorance mr syddall very reluctantly as it appeared to me the butler led the way to the library and contrary to what he had given me to expect the interior of the apartment looked as if it had been lately arranged and made more comfortable than usual there was a fire in the grate which burned clearly notwithstanding what syddall had reported of the vent taking up the tongs as if to arrange the wood but rather perhaps to conceal his own confusion the butler observed it was burning clear now but had smoked woundily in the morning wishing to be alone till i recovered myself from the first painful sensations which everything around me recalled i desired old syddall to call the landsteward who lived at about a quarter of a mile from the hall he departed with obvious reluctance i next ordered andrew to procure the attendance of a couple of stout fellows upon whom he could rely the population around being papists and sir rashleigh who was capable of any desperate enterprise being in the neighbourhood andrew fairservice undertook this task with great cheerfulness and promised to bring me up from trinlayknowe twa trueblue presbyterians like himself that would face and outface baith the pope the devil and the pretender and blythe will i be o their company mysell for the very last night that i was at osbaldistone hall the blight be on ilka blossom in my bit yard if i didna see that very picture pointing to the fulllength portrait of miss vernons grandfather walking by moonlight in the garden i tauld your honour i was fleyed wi a bogle that night but ye wadna listen to me i aye thought there was witchcraft and deevilry amang the papishers but i neer sawt wi bodily een till that awfu night get along sir said i and bring the fellows you talk of and see they have more sense than yourself and are not frightened at their own shadow i hae been counted as gude a man as my neighbours ere now said andrew petulantly but i dinna pretend to deal wi evil spirits and so he made his exit as wardlaw the landsteward made his appearance he was a man of sense and honesty without whose careful management my uncle would have found it difficult to have maintained himself a housekeeper so long as he did he examined the nature of my right of possession carefully and admitted it candidly to any one else the succession would have been a poor one so much was the land encumbered with debt and mortgage most of these however were already vested in my fathers person and he was in a train of acquiring the rest his large gains by the recent rise of the funds having made it a matter of ease and convenience for him to pay off the debt which affected his patrimony i transacted much necessary business with mr wardlaw and detained him to dine with me we preferred taking our repast in the library although syddall strongly recommended our removing to the stonehall which he had put in order for the occasion meantime andrew made his appearance with his trueblue recruits whom he recommended in the highest terms as sober decent men weel founded in doctrinal points and above all as bold as lions i ordered them something to drink and they left the room i observed old syddall shake his head as they went out and insisted upon knowing the reason i maybe cannot expect he said that your honour should put confidence in what i say but it is heavens truth for all that ambrose wingfield is as honest a man as lives but if there is a false knave in the country it is his brother lancie the whole country knows him to be a spy for clerk jobson on the poor gentlemen that have been in trouble but hes a dissenter and i suppose thats enough nowadays having thus far given vent to his feelings to which however i was little disposed to pay attention and having placed the wine on the table the old butler left the apartment mr wardlaw having remained with me until the evening was somewhat advanced at length bundled up his papers and removed himself to his own habitation leaving me in that confused state of mind in which we can hardly say whether we desire company or solitude i had not however the choice betwixt them for i was left alone in the room of all others most calculated to inspire me with melancholy reflections as twilight was darkening the apartment andrew had the sagacity to advance his head at the door not to ask if i wished for lights but to recommend them as a measure of precaution against the bogles which still haunted his imagination i rejected his proffer somewhat peevishly trimmed the woodfire and placing myself in one of the large leathern chairs which flanked the old gothic chimney i watched unconsciously the bickering of the blaze which i had fostered and this said i alone is the progress and the issue of human wishes nursed by the merest trifles they are first kindled by fancy nay are fed upon the vapour of hope till they consume the substance which they inflame and man and his hopes passions and desires sink into a worthless heap of embers and ashes there was a deep sigh from the opposite side of the room which seemed to reply to my reflections i started up in amazement diana vernon stood before me resting on the arm of a figure so strongly resembling that of the portrait so often mentioned that i looked hastily at the frame expecting to see it empty my first idea was either that i had gone suddenly distracted or that the spirits of the dead had arisen and been placed before me a second glance convinced me of my being in my senses and that the forms which stood before me were real and substantial it was diana herself though paler and thinner than her former self and it was no tenant of the grave who stood beside her but vaughan or rather sir frederick vernon in a dress made to imitate that of his ancestor to whose picture his countenance possessed a family resemblance he was the first that spoke for diana kept her eyes fast fixed on the ground and astonishment actually riveted my tongue to the roof of my mouth we are your suppliants mr osbaldistone he said and we claim the refuge and protection of your roof till we can pursue a journey where dungeons and death gape for me at every step surely i articulated with great difficulty miss vernon cannot suppose you sir cannot believe that i have forgot your interference in my difficulties or that i am capable of betraying any one much less you i know it said sir frederick yet it is with the most inexpressible reluctance that i impose on you a confidence disagreeable perhaps certainly dangerous and which i would have specially wished to have conferred on some one else but my fate which has chased me through a life of perils and escapes is now pressing me hard and i have no alternative at this moment the door opened and the voice of the officious andrew was heard am bringin in the caunles ye can light them gin ye like can do is easy carried about wi ane i ran to the door which as i hoped i reached in time to prevent his observing who were in the apartment i turned him out with hasty violence shut the door after him and locked it then instantly remembering his two companions below knowing his talkative humour and recollecting syddalls remark that one of them was supposed to be a spy i followed him as fast as i could to the servants hall in which they were assembled andrews tongue was loud as i opened the door but my unexpected appearance silenced him what is the matter with you you fool said i you stare and look wild as if you had seen a ghost n n no nothing said andrew but your worship was pleased to be hasty because you disturbed me out of a sound sleep you fool syddall tells me he cannot find beds for these good fellows tonight and mr wardlaw thinks there will be no occasion to detain them here is a crownpiece for them to drink my health and thanks for their goodwill you will leave the hall immediately my good lads the men thanked me for my bounty took the silver and withdrew apparently unsuspicious and contented i watched their departure until i was sure they could have no further intercourse that night with honest andrew and so instantly had i followed on his heels that i thought he could not have had time to speak two words with them before i interrupted him but it is wonderful what mischief may be done by only two words on this occasion they cost two lives having made these arrangements the best which occurred to me upon the pressure of the moment to secure privacy for my guests i returned to report my proceedings and added that i had desired syddall to answer every summons concluding that it was by his connivance they had been secreted in the hall diana raised her eyes to thank me for the caution you now understand my mystery she said you know doubtless how near and dear that relative is who has so often found shelter here and will be no longer surprised that rashleigh having such a secret at his command should rule me with a rod of iron her father added that it was their intention to trouble me with their presence as short a time as was possible i entreated the fugitives to waive every consideration but what affected their safety and to rely on my utmost exertions to promote it this led to an explanation of the circumstances under which they stood i always suspected rashleigh osbaldistone said sir frederick but his conduct towards my unprotected child which with difficulty i wrung from her and his treachery in your fathers affairs made me hate and despise him in our last interview i concealed not my sentiments as i should in prudence have attempted to do and in resentment of the scorn with which i treated him he added treachery and apostasy to his catalogue of crimes i at that time fondly hoped that his defection would be of little consequence the earl of mar had a gallant army in scotland and lord derwentwater with forster kenmure winterton and others were assembling forces on the border as my connections with these english nobility and gentry were extensive it was judged proper that i should accompany a detachment of highlanders who under brigadier macintosh of borlum crossed the firth of forth traversed the low country of scotland and united themselves on the borders with the english insurgents my daughter accompanied me through the perils and fatigues of a march so long and difficult and she will never leave her dear father exclaimed miss vernon clinging fondly to his arm i had hardly joined our english friends when i became sensible that our cause was lost our numbers diminished instead of increasing nor were we joined by any except of our own persuasion the tories of the high church remained in general undecided and at length we were cooped up by a superior force in the little town of preston we defended ourselves resolutely for one day on the next the hearts of our leaders failed and they resolved to surrender at discretion to yield myself up on such terms were to have laid my head on the block about twenty or thirty gentlemen were of my mind we mounted our horses and placed my daughter who insisted on sharing my fate in the centre of our little party my companions struck with her courage and filial piety declared that they would die rather than leave her behind we rode in a body down a street called fishergate which leads to a marshy ground or meadow extending to the river ribble through which one of our party promised to show us a good ford this marsh had not been strongly invested by the enemy so that we had only an affair with a patrol of honeywoods dragoons whom we dispersed and cut to pieces we crossed the river gained the high road to liverpool and then dispersed to seek several places of concealment and safety my fortune led me to wales where there are many gentlemen of my religious and political opinions i could not however find a safe opportunity of escaping by sea and found myself obliged again to draw towards the north a welltried friend has appointed to meet me in this neighbourhood and guide me to a seaport on the solway where a sloop is prepared to carry me from my native country for ever as osbaldistone hall was for the present uninhabited and under the charge of old syddall who had been our confidant on former occasions we drew to it as to a place of known and secure refuge i resumed a dress which had been used with good effect to scare the superstitious rustics or domestics who chanced at any time to see me and we expected from time to time to hear by syddall of the arrival of our friendly guide when your sudden coming hither and occupying this apartment laid us under the necessity of submitting to your mercy thus ended sir fredericks story whose tale sounded to me like one told in a vision and i could hardly bring myself to believe that i saw his daughters form once more before me in flesh and blood though with diminished beauty and sunk spirits the buoyant vivacity with which she had resisted every touch of adversity had now assumed the air of composed and submissive but dauntless resolution and constancy her father though aware and jealous of the effect of her praises on my mind could not forbear expatiating upon them she has endured trials he said which might have dignified the history of a martyr she has faced danger and death in various shapes she has undergone toil and privation from which men of the strongest frame would have shrunk she has spent the day in darkness and the night in vigil and has never breathed a murmur of weakness or complaint in a word mr osbaldistone he concluded she is a worthy offering to that god to whom crossing himself i shall dedicate her as all that is left dear or precious to frederick vernon there was a silence after these words of which i well understood the mournful import the father of diana was still as anxious to destroy my hopes of being united to her now as he had shown himself during our brief meeting in scotland we will now said he to his daughter intrude no farther on mr osbaldistones time since we have acquainted him with the circumstances of the miserable guests who claim his protection i requested them to stay and offered myself to leave the apartment sir frederick observed that my doing so could not but excite my attendants suspicion and that the place of their retreat was in every respect commodious and furnished by syddall with all they could possibly want we might perhaps have even contrived to remain there concealed from your observation but it would have been unjust to decline the most absolute reliance on your honour you have done me but justice i replied to you sir frederick i am but little known but miss vernon i am sure will bear me witness that i do not want my daughters evidence he said politely but yet with an air calculated to prevent my addressing myself to diana since i am prepared to believe all that is worthy of mr francis osbaldistone permit us now to retire we must take repose when we can since we are absolutely uncertain when we may be called upon to renew our perilous journey he drew his daughters arm within his and with a profound reverence disappeared with her behind the tapestry chapter twenty second but now the hand of fate is on the curtain and gives the scene to light don sebastian i felt stunned and chilled as they retired imagination dwelling on an absent object of affection paints her not only in the fairest light but in that in which we most desire to behold her i had thought of diana as she was when her parting tear dropped on my cheek when her parting token received from the wife of macgregor augured her wish to convey into exile and conventual seclusion the remembrance of my affection i saw her and her cold passive manner expressive of little except composed melancholy disappointed and in some degree almost offended me in the egotism of my feelings i accused her of indifference of insensibility i upbraided her father with pride with cruelty with fanaticism forgetting that both were sacrificing their interest and diana her inclination to the discharge of what they regarded as their duty sir frederick vernon was a rigid catholic who thought the path of salvation too narrow to be trodden by an heretic and diana to whom her fathers safety had been for many years the principal and moving spring of thoughts hopes and actions felt that she had discharged her duty in resigning to his will not alone her property in the world but the dearest affections of her heart but it was not surprising that i could not at such a moment fully appreciate these honourable motives yet my spleen sought no ignoble means of discharging itself i am contemned then i said when left to run over the tenor of sir fredericks communications i am contemned and thought unworthy even to exchange words with her be it so they shall not at least prevent me from watching over her safety here will i remain as an outpost and while under my roof at least no danger shall threaten her if it be such as the arm of one determined man can avert i summoned syddall to the library he came but came attended by the eternal andrew who dreaming of great things in consequence of my taking possession of the hall and the annexed estates was resolved to lose nothing for want of keeping himself in view and as often happens to men who entertain selfish objects overshot his mark and rendered his attentions tedious and inconvenient his unrequired presence prevented me from speaking freely to syddall and i dared not send him away for fear of increasing such suspicions as he might entertain from his former abrupt dismissal from the library i shall sleep here sir i said giving them directions to wheel nearer to the fire an oldfashioned daybed or settee i have much to do and shall go late to bed syddall who seemed to understand my look offered to procure me the accommodation of a mattress and some bedding i accepted his offer dismissed my attendant lighted a pair of candles and desired that i might not be disturbed till seven in the ensuing morning the domestics retired leaving me to my painful and illarranged reflections until nature worn out should require some repose i endeavoured forcibly to abstract my mind from the singular circumstances in which i found myself placed feelings which i had gallantly combated while the exciting object was remote were now exasperated by my immediate neighbourhood to her whom i was so soon to part with for ever her name was written in every book which i attempted to peruse and her image forced itself on me in whatever train of thought i strove to engage myself it was like the officious slave of priors solomon abra was ready ere i named her name and when i called another abra came i alternately gave way to these thoughts and struggled against them sometimes yielding to a mood of melting tenderness of sorrow which was scarce natural to me sometimes arming myself with the hurt pride of one who had experienced what he esteemed unmerited rejection i paced the library until i had chafed myself into a temporary fever i then threw myself on the couch and endeavoured to dispose myself to sleep but it was in vain that i used every effort to compose myself that i lay without movement of finger or of muscle as still as if i had been already a corpse that i endeavoured to divert or banish disquieting thoughts by fixing my mind on some act of repetition or arithmetical process my blood throbbed to my feverish apprehension in pulsations which resembled the deep and regular strokes of a distant fullingmill and tingled in my veins like streams of liquid fire at length i arose opened the window and stood by it for some time in the clear moonlight receiving in part at least that refreshment and dissipation of ideas from the clear and calm scene without which they had become beyond the command of my own volition i resumed my place on the couch with a heart heaven knows not lighter but firmer and more resolved for endurance in a short time a slumber crept over my senses still however though my senses slumbered my soul was awake to the painful feelings of my situation and my dreams were of mental anguish and external objects of terror i remember a strange agony under which i conceived myself and diana in the power of macgregors wife and about to be precipitated from a rock into the lake the signal was to be the discharge of a cannon fired by sir frederick vernon who in the dress of a cardinal officiated at the ceremony nothing could be more lively than the impression which i received of this imaginary scene i could paint even at this moment the mute and courageous submission expressed in dianas features the wild and distorted faces of the executioners who crowded around us with mopping and mowing grimaces ever changing and each more hideous than that which preceded i saw the rigid and inflexible fanaticism painted in the face of the father i saw him lift the fatal match the deadly signal exploded it was repeated again and again and again in rival thunders by the echoes of the surrounding cliffs and i awoke from fancied horror to real apprehension the sounds in my dream were not ideal they reverberated on my waking ears but it was two or three minutes ere i could collect myself so as distinctly to understand that they proceeded from a violent knocking at the gate i leaped from my couch in great apprehension took my sword under my arm and hastened to forbid the admission of any one but my route was necessarily circuitous because the library looked not upon the quadrangle but into the gardens when i had reached a staircase the windows of which opened upon the entrance court i heard the feeble and intimidated tones of syddall expostulating with rough voices which demanded admittance by the warrant of justice standish and in the kings name and threatened the old domestic with the heaviest penal consequences if he refused instant obedience ere they had ceased i heard to my unspeakable provocation the voice of andrew bidding syddall stand aside and let him open the door if they come in king georges name we have naething to fear we hae spent baith bluid and gowd for him we dinna need to darn ourselves like some folks mr syddall we are neither papists nor jacobites i trow it was in vain i accelerated my pace down stairs i heard bolt after bolt withdrawn by the officious scoundrel while all the time he was boasting his own and his masters loyalty to king george and i could easily calculate that the party must enter before i could arrive at the door to replace the bars devoting the back of andrew fairservice to the cudgel so soon as i should have time to pay him his deserts i ran back to the library barricaded the door as i best could and hastened to that by which diana and her father entered and begged for instant admittance diana herself undid the door she was ready dressed and betrayed neither perturbation nor fear danger is so familiar to us she said that we are always prepared to meet it my father is already up he is in rashleighs apartment we will escape into the garden and thence by the posterngate i have the key from syddall in case of need into the wood i know its dingles better than any one now alive keep them a few minutes in play and dear dear frank once more faretheewell she vanished like a meteor to join her father and the intruders were rapping violently and attempting to force the library door by the time i had returned into it you robber dogs i exclaimed wilfully mistaking the purpose of their disturbance if you do not instantly quit the house i will fire my blunderbuss through the door fire a fules bauble said andrew fairservice its mr clerk jobson with a legal warrant to search for take and apprehend said the voice of that execrable pettifogger the bodies of certain persons in my warrant named charged of high treason under the th of king william chapter third and the violence on the door was renewed i am rising gentlemen said i desirous to gain as much time as possible commit no violence give me leave to look at your warrant and if it is formal and legal i shall not oppose it god save great george our king ejaculated andrew i tauld ye that ye would find nae jacobites here spinning out the time as much as possible i was at length compelled to open the door which they would otherwise have forced mr jobson entered with several assistants among whom i discovered the younger wingfield to whom doubtless he was obliged for his information and exhibited his warrant directed not only against frederick vernon an attainted traitor but also against diana vernon spinster and francis osbaldistone gentleman accused of misprision of treason it was a case in which resistance would have been madness i therefore after capitulating for a few minutes delay surrendered myself a prisoner i had next the mortification to see jobson go straight to the chamber of miss vernon and i learned that from thence without hesitation or difficulty he went to the room where sir frederick had slept the hare has stolen away said the brute but her form is warm the greyhounds will have her by the haunches yet a scream from the garden announced that he prophesied too truly in the course of five minutes rashleigh entered the library with sir frederick vernon and his daughter as prisoners the fox he said knew his old earth but he forgot it could be stopped by a careful huntsman i had not forgot the gardengate sir frederick or if that title suits you better most noble lord beauchamp rashleigh said sir frederick thou art a detestable villain i better deserved the name sir knight or my lord when under the direction of an able tutor i sought to introduce civil war into the bosom of a peaceful country but i have done my best said he looking upwards to atone for my errors i could hold no longer i had designed to watch their proceedings in silence but i felt that i must speak or die if hell i said has one complexion more hideous than another it is where villany is masked by hypocrisy ha my gentle cousin said rashleigh holding a candle towards me and surveying me from head to foot right welcome to osbaldistone hall i can forgive your spleen it is hard to lose an estate and a mistress in one night for we shall take possession of this poor manorhouse in the name of the lawful heir sir rashleigh osbaldistone while rashleigh braved it out in this manner i could see that he put a strong force upon his feelings both of anger and shame but his state of mind was more obvious when diana vernon addressed him rashleigh she said i pity you for deep as the evil is which you have laboured to do me and the evil you have actually done i cannot hate you so much as i scorn and pity you what you have now done may be the work of an hour but will furnish you with reflection for your life of what nature i leave to your own conscience which will not slumber for ever rashleigh strode once or twice through the room came up to the sidetable on which wine was still standing and poured out a large glass with a trembling hand but when he saw that we observed his tremor he suppressed it by a strong effort and looking at us with fixed and daring composure carried the bumper to his head without spilling a drop it is my fathers old burgundy he said looking to jobson i am glad there is some of it left you will get proper persons to take care of old butler and that foolish scotch rascal meanwhile we will convey these persons to a more proper place of custody i have provided the old family coach for your convenience he said though i am not ignorant that even the lady could brave the nightair on foot or on horseback were the errand more to her mind andrew wrung his hands i only said that my master was surely speaking to a ghaist in the library and the villain lancie to betray an auld friend that sang aff the same psalmbook wi him every sabbath for twenty years he was turned out of the house together with syddall without being allowed to conclude his lamentation his expulsion however led to some singular consequences resolving according to his own story to go down for the night where mother simpson would give him a lodging for old acquaintance sake he had just got clear of the avenue and into the old wood as it was called though it was now used as a pastureground rather than woodland when he suddenly lighted on a drove of scotch cattle which were lying there to repose themselves after the days journey at this andrew was in no way surprised it being the wellknown custom of his countrymen who take care of those droves to quarter themselves after night upon the best unenclosed grassground they can find and depart before daybreak to escape paying for their nights lodgings but he was both surprised and startled when a highlander springing up accused him of disturbing the cattle and refused him to pass forward till he had spoken to his master the mountaineer conducted andrew into a thicket where he found three or four more of his countrymen and said andrew i saw sune they were ower mony men for the drove and from the questions they put to me i judged they had other tow on their rock they questioned him closely about all that had passed at osbaldistone hall and seemed surprised and concerned at the report he made to them and troth said andrew i tauld them a i kend for dirks and pistols were what i could never refuse information to in a my life they talked in whispers among themselves and at length collected their cattle together and drove them close up to the entrance of the avenue which might be half a mile distant from the house they proceeded to drag together some felled trees which lay in the vicinity so as to make a temporary barricade across the road about fifteen yards beyond the avenue it was now near daybreak and there was a pale eastern gleam mingled with the fading moonlight so that objects could be discovered with some distinctness the lumbering sound of a coach drawn by four horses and escorted by six men on horseback was heard coming up the avenue the highlanders listened attentively the carriage contained mr jobson and his unfortunate prisoners the escort consisted of rashleigh and of several horsemen peaceofficers and their assistants so soon as we had passed the gate at the head of the avenue it was shut behind the cavalcade by a highlandman stationed there for that purpose at the same time the carriage was impeded in its farther progress by the cattle amongst which we were involved and by the barricade in front two of the escort dismounted to remove the felled trees which they might think were left there by accident or carelessness the others began with their whips to drive the cattle from the road who dare abuse our cattle said a rough voice shoot him angus rashleigh instantly called out a rescue a rescue and firing a pistol wounded the man who spoke claymore cried the leader of the highlanders and a scuffle instantly commenced the officers of the law surprised at so sudden an attack and not usually possessing the most desperate bravery made but an imperfect defence considering the superiority of their numbers some attempted to ride back to the hall but on a pistol being fired from behind the gate they conceived themselves surrounded and at length galloped of in different directions rashleigh meanwhile had dismounted and on foot had maintained a desperate and singlehanded conflict with the leader of the band the window of the carriage on my side permitted me to witness it at length rashleigh dropped will you ask forgiveness for the sake of god king james and auld friendship said a voice which i knew right well no never said rashleigh firmly then traitor die in your treason retorted macgregor and plunged his sword in his prostrate antagonist in the next moment he was at the carriage door handed out miss vernon assisted her father and me to alight and dragging out the attorney head foremost threw him under the wheel mr osbaldistone he said in a whisper you have nothing to fear i must look after those who have your friends will soon be in safety farewell and forget not the macgregor he whistled his band gathered round him and hurrying diana and her father along with him they were almost instantly lost in the glades of the forest the coachman and postilion had abandoned their horses and fled at the first discharge of firearms but the animals stopped by the barricade remained perfectly still and well for jobson that they did so for the slightest motion would have dragged the wheel over his body my first object was to relieve him for such was the rascals terror that he never could have risen by his own exertions i next commanded him to observe that i had neither taken part in the rescue nor availed myself of it to make my escape and enjoined him to go down to the hall and call some of his party who had been left there to assist the wounded but jobsons fears had so mastered and controlled every faculty of his mind that he was totally incapable of moving i now resolved to go myself but in my way i stumbled over the body of a man as i thought dead or dying it was however andrew fairservice as well and whole as ever he was in his life who had only taken this recumbent posture to avoid the slashes stabs and pistolballs which for a moment or two were flying in various directions i was so glad to find him that i did not inquire how he came thither but instantly commanded his assistance rashleigh was our first object he groaned when i approached him as much through spite as through pain and shut his eyes as if determined like iago to speak no word more we lifted him into the carriage and performed the same good office to another wounded man of his party who had been left on the field i then with difficulty made jobson understand that he must enter the coach also and support sir rashleigh upon the seat he obeyed but with an air as if he but half comprehended my meaning andrew and i turned the horses heads round and opening the gate of the avenue led them slowly back to osbaldistone hall some fugitives had already reached the hall by circuitous routes and alarmed its garrison by the news that sir rashleigh clerk jobson and all their escort save they who escaped to tell the tale had been cut to pieces at the head of the avenue by a whole regiment of wild highlanders when we reached the mansion therefore we heard such a buzz as arises when bees are alarmed and mustering in their hives mr jobson however who had now in some measure come to his senses found voice enough to make himself known he was the more anxious to be released from the carriage as one of his companions the peaceofficer had to his inexpressible terror expired by his side with a hideous groan sir rashleigh osbaldistone was still alive but so dreadfully wounded that the bottom of the coach was filled with his blood and long traces of it left from the entrancedoor into the stonehall where he was placed in a chair some attempting to stop the bleeding with cloths while others called for a surgeon and no one seemed willing to go to fetch one torment me not said the wounded man i know no assistance can avail me i am a dying man he raised himself in his chair though the damps and chill of death were already on his brow and spoke with a firmness which seemed beyond his strength cousin francis he said draw near to me i approached him as he requested i wish you only to know that the pangs of death do not alter i one iota of my feelings towards you i hate you he said the expression of rage throwing a hideous glare into the eyes which were soon to be closed for ever i hate you with a hatred as intense now while i lie bleeding and dying before you as if my foot trode on your neck i have given you no cause sir i replied and for your own sake i could wish your mind in a better temper you have given me cause he rejoined in love in ambition in the paths of interest you have crossed and blighted me at every turn i was born to be the honour of my fathers house i have been its disgrace and all owing to you my very patrimony has become yours take it he said and may the curse of a dying man cleave to it illustration the death of rashleigh in a moment after he had uttered this frightful wish he fell back in the chair his eyes became glazed his limbs stiffened but the grin and glare of mortal hatred survived even the last gasp of life i will dwell no longer on so painful a picture nor say any more of the death of rashleigh than that it gave me access to my rights of inheritance without farther challenge and that jobson found himself compelled to allow that the ridiculous charge of misprision of high treason was got up on an affidavit which he made with the sole purpose of favouring rashleighs views and removing me from osbaldistone hall the rascals name was struck off the list of attorneys and he was reduced to poverty and contempt i returned to london when i had put my affairs in order at osbaldistone hall and felt happy to escape from a place which suggested so many painful recollections my anxiety was now acute to learn the fate of diana and her father a french gentleman who came to london on commercial business was intrusted with a letter to me from miss vernon which put my mind at rest respecting their safety it gave me to understand that the opportune appearance of macgregor and his party was not fortuitous the scottish nobles and gentry engaged in the insurrection as well as those of england were particularly anxious to further the escape of sir frederick vernon who as an old and trusted agent of the house of stuart was possessed of matter enough to have ruined half scotland rob roy of whose sagacity and courage they had known so many proofs was the person whom they pitched upon to assist his escape and the place of meeting was fixed at osbaldistone hall you have already heard how nearly the plan had been disconcerted by the unhappy rashleigh it succeeded however perfectly for when once sir frederick and his daughter were again at large they found horses prepared for them and by macgregors knowledge of the country for every part of scotland and of the north of england was familiar to him were conducted to the western seacoast and safely embarked for france the same gentleman told me that sir frederick was not expected to survive for many months a lingering disease the consequence of late hardships and privations his daughter was placed in a convent and although it was her fathers wish she should take the veil he was understood to refer the matter entirely to her own inclinations when these news reached me i frankly told the state of my affections to my father who was not a little startled at the idea of my marrying a roman catholic but he was very desirous to see me settled in life as he called it and he was sensible that in joining him with heart and hand in his commercial labours i had sacrificed my own inclinations after a brief hesitation and several questions asked and answered to his satisfaction he broke out with i little thought a son of mine should have been lord of osbaldistone manor and far less that he should go to a french convent for a spouse but so dutiful a daughter cannot but prove a good wife you have worked at the desk to please me frank it is but fair you should wive to please yourself how i sped in my wooing will tresham i need not tell you you know too how long and happily i lived with diana you know how i lamented her but you do not cannot know how much she deserved her husbands sorrow i have no more of romantic adventure to tell nor indeed anything to communicate farther since the latter incidents of my life are so well known to one who has shared with the most friendly sympathy the joys as well as the sorrows by which its scenes have been chequered i often visited scotland but never again saw the bold highlander who had such an influence on the early events of my life i learned however from time to time that he continued to maintain his ground among the mountains of loch lomond in despite of his powerful enemies and that he even obtained to a certain degree the connivance of government to his selfelected office of protector of the lennox in virtue of which he levied blackmail with as much regularity as the proprietors did their ordinary rents it seemed impossible that his life should have concluded without a violent end nevertheless he died in old age and by a peaceful death some time about the year and is still remembered in his country as the robin hood of scotland the dread of the wealthy but the friend of the poor and possessed of many qualities both of head and heart which would have graced a less equivocal profession than that to which his fate condemned him old andrew fairservice used to say that there were many things ower bad for blessing and ower gude for banning like rob roy here the original manuscript ends somewhat abruptly i have reason to think that what followed related to private a affairs postscript the second article of the appendix to the introduction to rob roy contains two curious letters respecting the arrest of mr grahame of killearn by that daring freebooter while levying the duke of montroses rents these were taken from scroll copies in the possession of his grace the present duke who kindly permitted the use of them in the present publication the novel had but just passed through the press when the right honourable mr peel whose important state avocations do not avert his attention from the interests of literature transmitted to the author copies of the original letters and enclosure of which he possessed only the rough draught the originals were discovered in the state paper office by the indefatigable researches of mr lemon who is daily throwing more light on that valuable collection of records from the documents with which the author has been thus kindly favoured he is enabled to fill up the addresses which were wanting in the scrolls that of the st nov is addressed to lord viscount townshend and is accompanied by one of the same date to robert pringle esquire undersecretary of state which is here inserted as relative to so curious an incident letter from the duke of montrose to robert pringle esq undersecretary to lord viscount townshend sr glasgow nov haveing had so many dispatches to make this night i hope yel excuse me that i make use of another hand to give yow a short account of the occasion of this express by which i have written to my ld duke of roxburgh and my lord townshend which i hope yel gett carefully deleivered mr graham younger of killearn being on munday last in menteith att a country house collecting my rents was about nine oclock that same night surprised by rob roy with a party of his men in arms who haveing surrounded the house and secured the avenues presented their guns in at the windows while he himself entered the room with some others with cokt pistolls and seased killearn with all his money books papers and bonds and carryed all away with him to the hills at the same time ordering killearn to write a letter to me of which ye have the copy inclosed proposeing a very honourable treaty to me i must say this story was as surprising to me as it was insolent and it must bring a very great concern upon me that this gentleman my near relation should be brought to suffer all the barbaritys and crueltys which revenge and mallice may suggest to these miscreants for his haveing acted a faithfull part in the service of the government and his affection to me in my concerns i need not be more particular to you since i know that my letter to my lord townshend will come into your hands so shall only now give you the assurances of my being with great sincerity sr yr most humble servant signed montrose i long exceedingly for a return of my former dispatches to the secretarys about methven and colll urquhart and my wifes cousins balnamoon and phinaven i must beg yowll give my humble service to mr secretary methven and tell him that i must refer him to what i have written to my lord townshend in this affair of rob roy believing it was needless to trouble both with letters examined robt lemon deputy keeper of state papers state paper office nov note the enclosure referred to in the preceding letter is another copy of the letter which mr grahame of killearn was compelled by rob roy to write to the duke of montrose and is exactly the same as the one enclosed in his graces letter to lord townshend dated november st r l the last letter in the appendix no ii th november acquainting the government with killearns being set at liberty is also addressed to the undersecretary of state mr pringle the author may also here remark that immediately previous to the insurrection of he perceives from some notes of information given to government that rob roy appears to have been much employed and trusted by the jacobite party even in the very delicate task of transporting specie to the earl of breadalbane though it might have somewhat resembled trusting don raphael and ambrose de lamela with the church treasure notes to rob roy note a the grey stone of macgregor i have been informed that at no very remote period it was proposed to take this large stone which marks the grave of dugald ciar mhor and convert it to the purpose of the lintel of a window the threshold of a door or some such mean use a man of the clan macgregor who was somewhat deranged took fire at this insult and when the workmen came to remove the stone planted himself upon it with a broad axe in his hand swearing he would dash out the brains of any one who should disturb the monument athletic in person and insane enough to be totally regardless of consequences it was thought best to give way to his humour and the poor madman kept sentinel on the stone day and night till the proposal of removing it was entirely dropped note b dugald ciar mhor the above is the account which i find in a manuscript history of the clan macgregor of which i was indulged with a perusal by donald macgregor esq late major of the d regiment where great pains have been taken to collect traditions and written documents concerning the family but an ancient and constant tradition preserved among the inhabitants of the country and particularly those of the clan macfarlane relieves dugald ciar mhor of the guilt of murdering the youths and lays the blame on a certain donald or duncan lean who performed the act of cruelty with the assistance of a gillie who attended him named charlioch or charlie they say that the homicides dared not again join their clan but that they resided in a wild and solitary state as outlaws in an unfrequented part of the macfarlanes territory here they lived for some time undisturbed till they committed an act of brutal violence on two defenceless women a mother and daughter of the macfarlane clan in revenge of this atrocity the macfarlanes hunted them down and shot them it is said that the younger ruffian charlioch might have escaped being remarkably swift of foot but his crime became his punishment for the female whom he had outraged had defended herself desperately and had stabbed him with his own dirk in the thigh he was lame from the wound and was the more easily overtaken and killed i always inclined to think this last the true edition of the story and that the guilt was transferred to dugald ciar mhor as a man of higher name but i have learned that dugald was in truth dead several years before the battle my authority being his representative mr gregorson of ardtornish see also note to introduction legend of montrose vol vi note c the loch lomond expedition the loch lomond expedition was judged worthy to form a separate pamphlet which i have not seen but as quoted by the historian rae it must be delectable on the morrow being thursday the th they went on their expedition and about noon came to inversnaid the place of danger where the paisley men and those of dumbarton and several of the other companies to the number of an hundred men with the greatest intrepidity leapt on shore got up to the top of the mountains and stood a considerable time beating their drums all the while but no enemy appearing they went in quest of their boats which the rebels had seized and having casually lighted on some ropes and oars hid among the shrubs at length they found the boats drawn up a good way on the land which they hurled down to the loch such of them as were not damaged they carried off with them and such as were they sank and hewed to pieces that same night they returned to luss and thence next day to dumbarton from whence they had at first set out bringing along with them the whole boats they found in their way on either side of the loch and in the creeks of the isles and mooring them under the cannon of the castle during this expedition the pinnaces discharging their patararoes and the men their smallarms

were encamped at strath fillan raes history of the rebellion to p note d authors expedition against the maclarens the author is uncertain whether it is worth while to mention that he had a personal opportunity of observing even in his own time that the kings writ did not pass quite current in the brass of balquhidder there were very considerable debts due by stewart of appin chiefly to the authors family which were likely to be lost to the creditors if they could not be made available out of this same farm of invernenty the scene of the murder done upon maclaren his family consisting of several strapping deerstalkers still possessed the farm by virtue of a long lease for a trifling rent there was no chance of any one buying it with such an encumbrance and a transaction was entered into by the maclarens who being desirous to emigrate to america agreed to sell their lease to the creditors for l and to remove at the next term of whitsunday but whether they repented their bargain or desired to make a better or whether from a mere point of honour the maclarens declared they would not permit a summons of removal to be executed against them which was necessary for the legal completion of the bargain and such was the general impression that they were men capable of resisting the legal execution of warning by very effectual means no kings messenger would execute the summons without the support of a military force an escort of a sergeant and six men was obtained from a highland regiment lying in stirling and the author then a writers apprentice equivalent to the honourable situation of an attorneys clerk was invested with the superintendence of the expedition with directions to see that the messenger discharged his duty fully and that the gallant sergeant did not exceed his part by committing violence or plunder and thus it happened oddly enough that the author first entered the romantic scenery of loch katrine of which he may perhaps say he has somewhat extended the reputation riding in all the dignity of danger with a front and rear guard and loaded arms the sergeant was absolutely a highland sergeant kite full of stories of rob roy and of himself and a very good companion we experienced no interruption whatever and when we came to invernenty found the house deserted we took up our quarters for the night and used some of the victuals which we found there on the morning we returned as unmolested as we came the maclarens who probably never thought of any serious opposition received their money and went to america where having had some slight share in removing them from their paupera regna i sincerely hope they prospered the rent of invernenty instantly rose from l to l or l and when sold the farm was purchased i think by the late laird of

grizzled hair exhibited marks of having been red and his complexion was weatherbeaten and remarkably freckled some civilities in french passed between the old man and my friend in the course of which

been brought forth from their place of concealment in and exposed to the view of the people by whom they must be looked upon with deep associations and in this very winter of mons meg has been restored to the country where that which in every other place or situation was a mere mass of rusty iron becomes once more a curious monument of antiquity note h fairy superstition the lakes and precipices amidst which the avondhu or river forth has its birth are still according to popular tradition haunted by the elfin people the most peculiar but most pleasing of the creations of celtic superstitions the opinions entertained about these beings are much the same with those of the irish so exquisitely well narrated by mr crofton croker an eminently beautiful little conical hill near the eastern extremity of the valley of aberfoil is supposed to be one of their peculiar haunts and is the scene which awakens in andrew fairservice the terror of their power it is remarkable that two successive clergymen of this parish of aberfoil have employed themselves in writing about this fairy superstition the eldest of these was robert kirke a man of some talents who translated the psalms into gaelic verse he had formerly been minister at the neighbouring parish of balquhidder and died at aberfoil in at the early age of fortytwo he was author of the secret commonwealth which was printed after his death in an edition which i have never seen and was reprinted in edinburgh this is a work concerning the fairy people in whose existence mr kirke appears to have been a devout believer he describes them with the usual powers and qualities ascribed to such beings in highland tradition but what is sufficiently singular the rev robert kirke author of the said treatise is believed himself to have been taken away by the fairies in revenge perhaps for having let in too much light upon the secrets of their commonwealth we learn this catastrophe from the information of his successor the late amiable and learned dr patrick grahame also minister at aberfoil who in his sketches of perthshire has not forgotten to touch upon the daoine schie or men of peace the rev robert kirke was it seems walking upon a little eminence to the west of the present manse which is still held a dun shie or fairy mound when he sunk down in what seemed to mortals a fit and was supposed to be dead this however was not his real fate mr kirke was the near relation of graham of duchray the ancestor of the present general graham stirling shortly after his funeral he appeared in the dress in which he had sunk down to a medical relation of his own and of duchray go said he to him to my cousin duchray and tell him that i am not dead i fell down in a swoon and was carried into fairyland where i now am tell him that when he and my friends are assembled at the baptism of my child for he had left his wife pregnant i will appear in the room and that if he throws the knife which he holds in his hand over my head i will be released and restored to human society the man it seems neglected for some time to deliver the message mr kirke appeared to him a second time threatening to haunt him night and day till he executed his commission which at length he did the time of the baptism arrived they were seated at table the figure of mr kirke entered but the laird of duchray by some unaccountable fatality neglected to perform the prescribed ceremony mr kirke retired by another door and was seen no wore it is firmly believed that he is at this day in fairyland sketches of perthshire p the treatise by robert kirke here mentioned was written in the year but not printed till note i clachan of aberfoil i do not know how this might stand in mr osbaldistones day but i can assure the reader whose curiosity may lead him to visit the scenes of these romantic adventures that the clachan of aberfoil now affords a very comfortable little inn if he chances to be a scottish antiquary it will be an additional recommendation to him that he will find himself in the vicinity of the rev dr patrick grahame minister of the gospel at aberfoil whose urbanity in communicating information on the subject of national antiquities is scarce exceeded even by the stores of legendary lore which he has accumulated original note the respectable clergyman alluded to has been dead for some years see note h
