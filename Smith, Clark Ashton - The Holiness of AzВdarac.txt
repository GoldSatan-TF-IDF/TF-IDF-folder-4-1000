the holiness of azйdarac clark ashton smith i by the ram with a thousand ewes by the tail of dagon and the horns of derceto said azйdarac as he fingered the tiny potbellied vial of vermilion liquid on the table before him something will have to be done with this pestilential brother ambrose i have now learned that he was sent to ximes by the archbishop of averoigne for no other purpose than to gather proof of my subterraneous connection with azazel and the old ones he has spied upon my evocations in the vaults he has heard the hidden formulae and beheld the veritable manifestation of lilit and even of iogsotфt and sodagui those demons who are more ancient than the world and this very morning an hour agone he has mounted his white ass for the return journey to vyones there are two ways or in a sense there is one way in which i can avoid the bother and inconvenience of a trial for sorcery the contents of this vial must be administered to ambrose before he has reached his journeys end or failing this i myself shall be compelled to make use of a similar medicament jehan mauvaissoir looked at the vial and then at azйdarac he was not at all horrified nor even surprised by the nonepiscopal oaths and the somewhat uncanonical statements which he had just heard from the bishop of ximes he had known the bishop too long and too intimately and had rendered him too many services of an unconventional nature to be surprised at anything in fact he had known azйdarac long before the sorcerer had ever dreamt of becoming a prelate in a phase of his existence that was wholly unsuspected by the people of ximes and azйdarac had not troubled to keep many secrets from jehan at any time i understand said jehan you can depend upon it that the contents of the vial will be administered brother ambrose will hardly travel posthaste on that ambling white ass and he will not reach vyones before tomorrow noon there is abundant time to overtake him of course he knows me at least he knows jehan mauvaissoir but that can be easily remedied azйdarac smiled confidently i leave the affair and the vial in your hands jehan of course no matter what the eventuation with all the satanic and presatanic facilities at my disposal i should be in no great danger from these addlepated bigots however i am very comfortably situated here in ximes and the lot of a christian bishop who lives in the odor of incense and piety and maintains in a meanwhile a private understanding with the adversary is certainly preferable to the mischancy life of a hedgesorcerer i do not care to be annoyed or disturbed or ousted from my sinecure if such can be avoided may moloch devour that sanctimonious little milksop of an ambrose he went on i must be growing old and dull not to have suspected him before this it was the horrorstricken and averted look he has been wearing lately that made me think he had peered through the keyhole on the subterranean rites then when i heard he was leaving i wisely thought to review my library and i have found that the book of eibon which contains the oldest incantations and the secret manforgotten lore of iogsotфt and sodagui is now missing as you know i had replaced the former binding of aboriginal subhuman skin with the sheepleather of a christian missal and had surrounded the volume with rows of legitimate prayerbooks ambrose is carrying it away under his robe as proof conclusive that i am addicted to the black arts no one in averoigne will be able ta read the immemorial hyperborean script but the dragonsblood illuminations and drawings will be enough to damn me master and servant regarded each other for an interval of significant silence jehan eyed with profound respect the haughty stature the grimly lined lineaments the grizzled tonsure the odd ruddy crescent scar on the pallid brow of azйdarac and the sultry points of orangeyellow fire that seemed to burn deep down in the chill and liquid ebon of his eyes azйdarac in his turn considered with confidence the vulpine features and discreet inexpressive air of jehan who might have been and could be if necessary anything from a mercer to a cleric it is regrettable resumed azйdarac that any question of my holiness and devotional probity should have been raised among the clergy of averoigne but i suppose it was inevitable sooner or later even though the chief difference between myself and many other ecclesiastics is that i serve the devil wittingly and of my own free will while they do the same in sanctimonious blindness however we must do what we can to delay the evil hour of public scandal and eviction from our neatly feathered nest ambrose alone could prove anything to my detriment at present and you jehan will remove ambrose to a realm wherein his monkish tattlings will be of small consequence after that i shall be doubly vigilant the next emissary from vyones i assure you will find nothing to report but saintliness and beadtelling ii the thoughts of brother ambrose were sorely troubled and at variance with the tranquil beauty of the sylvan scene as he rode onward through the forest of averoigne between ximes and vyones horror was nesting in his heart like a knot of malignant vipers and the evil book of eibon that primordial manual of sorcery seemed to burn beneath his robe like a huge hot satanic sigil pressed against his bosom not for the first time there occurred to him the wish that clйment the archbishop had delegated someone else to investigate the erebean turpitude of azйdarac sojourning for a month in the bishops household ambrose had learned too much for the peace of mind of any pious cleric and had seen things that were like a secret blot of shame and terror on the white page of his memory to find that a christian prelate could serve the powers of nethermost perdition could entertain in privity the foulnesses that are older than asmodai was abysmally disturbing to his devout soul and ever since then he had seemed to smell corruption everywhere and had felt on every side the serpentine encroachment of the dark adversary as he rode on among the somber pines and verdant beeches he wished also that he were mounted on something swifter than the gentle milkwhite ass appointed for his use by the archbishop he was dogged by the shadowy intimation of leering gargoyle faces of invisible cloven feet that followed him behind the thronging trees and along the umbrageous meanderings of the road in the oblique rays the elongated webs of shadow wrought by the dying afternoon the forest seemed to attend with bated breath the noisome and furtive passing of innominable things nevertheless ambrose had met no one for miles and he had seen neither bird nor beast nor viper in the summer woods his thoughts returned with fearful insistence to azйdarac who appeared to him as a tall prodigious antichrist uprearing his sable vans and giant figure from out the flaming mire of abaddon again he saw the vaults beneath the bishops mansion wherein he had peered one night on a scene of infernal terror and loathliness had beheld the bishop swathed in the gorgeous coiling fumes of unholy censers that mingled in midair with the sulfurous and bituminous vapors of the pit and through the vapors had seen the lasciviously swaying limbs the bellying and dissolving features of foul enormous entities recalling them again he trembled at the preadamite lubriciousness of lilit again he shuddered at the transgalactic horror of the demon sodagui and the ultradimensional hideousness of that being known as iogsotфt to the sorcerers of averoigne how balefully potent and subversive he thought were these immemorial devils who had placed their servant azйdarac in the very bosom of the church in a position of high and holy trust for nine years the evil prelate had held an unchallenged and unsuspected tenure had befouled the bishopric of ximes with infidelities that were worse than those of the paynims then somehow through anonymous channels a rumour had reached clйment a warning whisper that not even the archbishop had dared to voice aloud and ambrose a young benedictine monk the nephew of clйment had been dispatched to examine privily the fester ing foulness that threatened the integrity of the church only at that time did anyone recall how little was actually known regarding the antecedents of azйdarac how tenuous were his claims to ecclesiastical preferment or even to mere priestship how veiled and doubtful were the steps by which he had attained his office it was then realized that a formidable wizardry had been at work uneasily ambrose wondered if azйdarac had already discovered the removal of the book of eibon from among the missals contaminated by its blasphemous presence even more uneasily he wondered what azйdarac would do in that event and how long it would take him to connect the absence of the volume with his visitors departure at this point the meditations of ambrose were inter rupted by the hard clatter of galloping hoofs that ap proached from behind the emergence of a centaur from the oldest wood of paganism could scarcely have startled him to a keener panic and he peered apprehensively over his shoulder at the nearing horseman this person mounted on a fine black steed with opulent trappings was a bushybearded of obvious consequence for his gay garments were those of a noble or a courtier he overtook ambrose and passed on with a polite nod seeming to be wholly intent on his own affairs the monk was immensely reassured though vaguely troubled for some moments by a feeling that he had seen elsewhere under circumstances which he was unable to recall the narrow eyes and sharp profile that contrasted so oddly with the bluff beard of the horseman however he was comfortably sure that he had never seen the man in ximes the rider soon vanished beyond a leafy turn of the arboreal highway ambrose returned to the pious horror and apprehensiveness of his former soliloquy as he went on it seemed to him that the sun had gone down with untimely and appalling swiftness though the heavens above were innocent of cloud and the lowlying air was free from vapors the woods were embrowned by an inexplicable gloom that gathered visibly on all sides in this gloom the trunks of the trees were strangely distorted and the low masses of foliage assumed unnatural and disquieting forms it appeared to ambrose that the silence around him was a fragile film through which the raucous rumble and mutter of diabolic voices might break at any moment even as the foul and sunken driftage that rises anon above the surface of a smoothly flowing river with much relief he remembered that he was not far from a wayside tavern known as the inn of bonne jouissance here since his journey to vyones was little more than half completed he resolved to tarry for the night a minute more and he saw the lights of the inn before their benign and golden radiance the equivocal forest shadows that attended him seemed to halt and retire and he gained the haven of the tavern courtyard with the feeling of one who has barely escaped from an army of goblin perils committing his mount to the care of a stableservant ambrose entered the main room of the inn here he was greeted with the deference due to his cloth by the stout and unctuous taverner and being assured that the best accommodations of the place were at his disposal he seated himself at one of several tables where other guests had already gathered to await the evening meal among them ambrose recognized the bluffbearded horseman who had overtaken him in the woods an hour agone this person was sitting alone and a little apart the other guests a couple of travelling mercers a notary and two soldiers acknowledged the presence of the monk with all due civility but the horseman arose from his table and coming over to ambrose began immediately to make overtures that were more than those of common courtesy will you not dine mth me sir monk he invited in a gruff but ingratiating voice that was perplexingly familiar to ambrose and yet like the wolfish profile was irrecognizable at the time i am the sieur des йmaux from touraine at your service the man went on it would seem that we are traveliag the same road possibly to the same destination mine is the cathedral city of vyones and yours though he was vaguely perturbed and even a little suspicious ambrose found himself unable to decline the invitation in reply to the last question he admitted that he also was on his way to vyones he did not altogether like the sieur des йmaux whose slitted eyes gave back the candlelight of the inn with a covert glitter and whose manner was somewhat effusive not to say fulsome but there seemed to be no ostensible reason for refusing a courtesy that was doubtless wellmeant and genuine he accompanied his host to their separate table you belong to the benedictine order i observe said the sieur des йmaux eyeing the monk with an odd smile that was tinged with furtive irony it is an order that i have always admired greatly a most noble and worthy brotherhood may i not inquire your name ambrose gave the requested information with a curious reluctance well then brother ambrose said the sieur des йmaux i suggest that we drink to your health and the prosperity of your order in the red wine of averoigne while we are waiting for supper to be served wine is always welcome following a long journey and is no less beneficial before a good meal than after ambrose mumbled an unwilling assent he could not have told why but the personality of the man was more and more distasteful to him he seemed to detect a sinister undertone in the purring voice to surprise an evil meaning in the lowlidded glance and all the while his brain was tantalized by intimations of a forgotten memory had he seen his interlocutor in ximes was the selfstyled sieur des йmaux a henchman of azйdarac in disguise wine was now ordered by his host who left the table to confer with the innkeeper for this purpose and even insisted on paying a visit to the cellar that he might select a suitable viatage in person noting the obeisance paid to the man by the people of the tavern who addressed him by name anbrose felt a certain measure of reassurance when the taverner followed by the sieur des йmaux returned with two earthen pitchers of wine he had wellnigh succeeded in dismissing his vague doubts and vaguer fears two large goblets were now placed on the table and the sieur des йmaux filled them immediately from one of the pitchers it seemed to ambrose that the first of the goblets already contained a small amount of some sanguine fluid before the wine was poured into it but he could not have sworn to this in the dim light and thaught that he must have been mistaken here are two matchless vintages said the sieur des йmaux indicating the pitchers both are so excellent that i was unable to choose between them but you brother ambrose are perhaps capable of deciding their merits with a finer palate than mine he pushed one of the filled goblets toward ambrose this is the wine of la frenaie he said drink it will verily transyort you from the world by virtue of the mighty fire that slumbers in its heart ambrose took the proffered goblet and raised it to his lips the sieur des йmaux was bending forward above his own wine to inhale its bouquet and something in his posture was terrifyingly familiar to ambrose in a chill flash of horror his memory told him that the thin pointed features behind the square beard were dubiously similar to those of jehan mauvaissoir whom he had often seen in the household of azйdarac and who as he had reason to believe was implicated in the bishops sorceries he wondered why he had not placed the resemblance before and what wizardry had drugged his powers of recollection even now he was not sure but the mere suspicion terrified him as if some deadly serpent had reared its head across the table drink brother ambrose urged the sieur des йmaux draining his own goblet to your welfare and that of all good benedictines ambrose hesitated the cold hypnotic eyes of his interlocutor were upon him and he was powerless to refuse in spite of all his apprehensions shuddering slightly with the sense of some irresistible compulsion and feeling that he might drop dead from the virulent working of a sudden poison he emptied his goblet an instant more and he felt that his worst fears had been justified the wine burned like the liquid flames of phlegeton in his throat and on his lips it seemed to fill his veins with a hot infernal quicksilver then all at once an unbearable cold had inundated his being an icy whirlwind wrapped him round with coils of roaring air the chair melted beneath him and he was falling through endless glacial gulfs the walls of the inn had flown like receding vapors the lights went out like stars in the black mist of a marish and the face of the sieur des йmaux faded with them on the swirling shadows even as a bubble that breaks on the milling of midnight waters iii it was with some difficulty that ambrose assured himself that he was not dead he had seemed to fall eternally through a gray night that was peopled with everchanging forms with blurred unstable masses that dissolved to other masses before they could assume definitude for a moment he thought there were walls about him once more and then he was plunging fron terrace to terrace of a world of phantom trees at whiles he thought also that there were human faces but all was doubtful and evanescent all was drifting smoke and surging shadow abruptly with no sense of transition or impact he found that he was no longer falling the vague fantasmagoria around him had returned to an actual scene but a scene in which there was no trace of the inn of bonne jouissance or the sieur des йmaux ambrose peered about with incredulous eyes on a situation that was truly unbelievable he was sitting in broad daylight on a large square block of roughly hewn granite around him at a little distance beyond the open space of a grassy glade were the lofty pines and spreading beeches of an elder forest whose boughs were already touched by the gold of the declining sun immediately before him several men were standing these men appeared to regard ambrose with a profound and almost religious amazement they were bearded and savage of aspect with white robes of a fashion he had never before seen their hair was long and matted like tangles of black snakes and their eyes burned with a frenetic fire each of them bore in his right hand a rude knife of sharply chiselled stone ambrose wondered if he had died after all and if these beings were the strange devils of some unlisted hell in the face of what had happened and the light of ambroses own beliefs it was a far from unreasanable conjecture he peered with fearful trepidation at the supposed demons and began to mumble a prayer to the god who had aban doned him so inexplicably to his spiritual foes then he remembered the necromantic powers of azйdarac and conceived another surmise that he had been spirited bodily away from the inn of bonne jouissance and delivered into the hands of those presatanic entities that served the sorcerous bishop becoming convinced of his own physical solidity and integrity and reflecting that such was scarcely the appropriate condition of a disincarnate soul and also that the sylvan scene about him was hardly characteristic of the infernal regions he accepted this as the true explanation he was still alive and still on earth though the circumstances of his situation were more than mysterious and were fraught with dire unknowable danger the strange beings had maintained an utter silence as if they were too dumbfounded for speech hearing the prayerful nurmurs of ambrose they seemed to recover from their surprise and became not only articulate but vociferous ambrose could make nothing of their harsh vocables in which sibilants and aspirates and gutturals were often combined in a manner difficult for the normal human tongue to imitate however he caught the word taranit several times repeated and wondered if it were the name of an especially malevolent demon the speech of the weird beings began to assume a sort of rude rhythm like the intonations of some primordial chant two of them stepped forward and seized ambrose while the voices of their companions rose in a shrill triumphant litany scarcely knowing what had happened and still less what was to follow ambrose was flung supine on the granite block and was held down by one of his captors while the other raised aloft the keen blade of chiselled flint which he carried the blade was poised in the air above ambroses heart and the monk realized in sudden terror that it would fall with dire velocity and pierce him through before the lapse of another moment then above the demoniac chanting which had risen to a mad malignant frenzy he heard the sweet and imperious cry of a womans voice in the wild confusion of his terror the words were strange and meaningless to him but plainly they were understood by his captors and were taken as an undeniable command the stone knife was lowered sullenly and ambrose was permitted to resume a sitting posture on the flat slab his rescuer was standing on the edge of the open glade in the wideflung umbrage of an ancient pine she came forward now and the whitegarmented beings fell back with evident respect before her she was very tall with a fearless and regal demeanor and was gowned in a dark shimmering blue like the starladen blue of nocturnal summer skies her hair was knotted in a long goldenbrown braid heavy as the glistening coils of some eastern serpcnt her eyes were a strange amber her lips a vermilion touched with the coolness of woodland shadow and her skin was of alabastrine fairness ambrose saw that she was beautiful but she inspired him with the same awe that he would have felt before a queen together with something of the fear and consternation which a virtuous young monk would conceive in the perilous presence of an alluring succubus come with me she said to ambrose in a tongue that his monastic studies enabled him to recognize as an obsolete variant of the french of averoigne a tongue that no man had supposedly spoken for many hundred years obediently and in great wonder he arose and followed her with no hindrance from his glowering and reluctant captors the woman led him to a narrow path that wound sinuously away through the deep forest in a few moments the glade the granite block and the cluster of whiterobed men were lost to sight behind the heavy foliage who are you asked the lady turning to ambrose you look like one of those crazy missionaries who are beginning to enter averoigne nowadays i believe that people call them christians the druids have sacrificed so many of them to taranit that i marvel at your temerity in coming here ambrose found it difficult to comprehend the archaic phrasing and the import of her words was so utterly strange and baffling that he felt sure he must have misunderstood her i am brother ambrose he replied expressing himself slowly and awkwardly in the longdisused dialect of course i am a christian but i confess that i fail to understand you i have heard of the pagan druids but surely they were all driven from averoigne many centuries ago the woman stared at ambrose with open amazement and pity her brownishyellow eyes were bright and clear as a mellowed wine poor little one she said i fear that your dreadful experiences have served to unsettle you it was fortunate that i came aiong when i did and decided to intervene i seldom interfere with the druids aud their sacrifices but i saw you sitting on their altar a little while agone and was struck by your youth and comeliness ambrose felt more and more that he had been made the victim of a most peculiar sorcery but even yet he was far from suspecting the true magnitude of this sorcery amid his bemusement and consternation however he realized that he owed his life to the singular and lovely woman beside him and began to stammer out his gratitude you need not thank me said the lady with a dulcet smile i am moriamis the enchantress and the druids fear my magic which is more sovereign and more excellent than theirs though i use it only for the welfare of men and not for their bale or bane the monk was dismayed to learn that his fair rescuer was a sorceress even though her powers were professedly benignant the knowledge added to his alarm but he felt that it would be politic to conceal his emotions in this regard indeed i am grateful to you he protested and now if you can tell me the way to the inn of bonne jouissance which i left not long ago i shall owe you a further debt moriamis knitted her light brows i have never heard of the inn of bonne jouissance there is no such place in this region but this is the forest of averoigne is it not inquired the puzzled ambrose and surely we are not far from the road that runs between the town of ximes and the city of vyones i have never heard of ximes or vyones either said moriamis truly the land is known as averoigne and this forest is the great wood of averoigne which men have called by that name from primeval years but there are no towns such as the ones whereof you speak brother ambrose i fear that you still wander a little in your mind ambrose was aware of a maddening perplexity i have been most damnably beguiled he said half to himself it is all the doing of that abominable sorcerer azйdarac i am sure the woman started as if she had been stung by a wild bee there was something both eager and severe in the searching gaze that she turned upon ambrose azйdarac she queried what do you know of azйdarac i was once acquainted with someone by that name and i wonder if it could be the same person is he tall and a little gray with hot dark eyes and a proud halfangry air and a crescent scar on the brow greatly mystified and more troubled than ever ambrose admitted the veracity of her description realizing that in same unknown way he had stumbled upon the hidden antecedents of the sorcerer he confided the story of his adventures to moriamis hoping that she would reciprocate with further information concerning azйdarac the woman listened with the air of one who is much interested but not at all surprised i understand now she observed when he had finished anon i shall explain everything that mystifies and troubles you i think i know this jehan mauvaissoir also he has long been the manservant of azйdarac though his name was melchire in other days these two have always been the underlings of evil and have served the old ones in ways forgotten or never known by the druids indeed i hope you can explain what has happened said ambrose it is a fearsome and strange and ungodly thing to drink a draft of wine in a tavern at eventide and then find ones self in the heart of the forest by afternoon daylight among demons such as those from whom you succored me yea countered moriamis it is even stranger than you dream tell me brother ambrose what was the year in which you entered the inn of bonne jouissance why it is the year of our lord of course what other year could it be the druids use a different chronology replied moriamis and their notation would mean nothing to you but according to that which the christian missionaries would now introduce in averoigne the present year is ad you have been sent back no less than seven hundred years into what the people of your era would regard as the past the druid altar an which i found you lying is probably located on the future site of the inn of bonne jouissance ambrose was more than dumbfounded his mind was unable to grasp the entire import of moriamis words but how can such things be he cried how can a man go backward in time among years and people that have long turned to dust that mayhap is a mystery for azйdarac to unriddle however the past and the future coexist with what we call the present and are merely the two segments of the circle of time we see them and name them according to our own position in the circle ambrose felt that he had fallen among necromancies of a most unhallowed and unexampled sort and had been made the victim of diableries unknown to the christian catalogues tonguetied by a consciousness that all comment all protest or even prayer would prove inadequate to the situation he saw that a stone tower with small lozengeshaped windows was now visible above the turrets of pine along the path which he and moriamis were following this is my home said moriamis as they came forth from beneath the thinning trees at the foot of a little knoll on which the tower was situated brother ambrose you must be my guest ambrose was unable to decline the proffered hospitality in spite of his feeling that moriamis was hardly the most suitable of chatelaines for a chaste and godfearing monk however the pious misgivings with which she inspired him were not unmingled with fascination also like a lost child he clung to the only available protection in a land of fearful perils and astounding mysteries the interior of the tower was neat and clean and homelike though with furniture of a ruder sort than that to which ambrose was accustomed and rich but roughly woven arrases a servingwoman tall as moriamis herself but darker brought to him a huge bowl of milk and wheaten bread and the monk was now able to assuage the hunger that had gone unsatisfied in the inn of bonne jouissance as he seated himself before the simple fare he realized that the book of eibon was still heavy in the bosom of his gown he removed the volume and gave it gingerly to moriamis her eyes widened but she made no comment until he had finished his meal then she said this volume is indeed the property of azйdarac who was formerly a neighbor of mine i knew the scoundrel quite well in fact i knew him all too well her bosom heaved with an obscure emotion as she paused for a moment he was the wisest and the mightiest of sorcerers and the most secret withal for no one knew the time and the manner of his coming into averoigne or the fashion in which he had procured the immemorial book of eibon whose runic writings were beyond the lore of all other wizards he was master of all enchantments and all demons and likewise a compounder of mighty potions among these were certain philtres blended with potent spells and possessed of unique virtue that would send the drinker backward or forward in time one of them i believe was administered to you by melchire or jehan mauvaissoir and azйdarac himself together with this manservant made use of another perhaps not for the first time when they went onward from the presemt age of the druids into that age of christian authority to which you belong there was a bloodred vial for the past and a green for the future behold i possess one of each though azйdarac was unaware that i knew of their existence she opened a little cupboard in which were the various charms and medicaments the sundried herbs and mooncompounded essences that a sorceress would employ from among them she brought out the two vials one of which contained a sanguinecolored liquid and the other a fluid of emerald brightness i stole them one day out of womanly curiosity from his hidden store of philtres and elixirs and nagistrals continued moriamis i could have followed the rascal when he disappeared into the future if i had chosen to do so but i am well enough content with ny own age and moreover i am not the sort of woman who pursues a wearied and reluctant lover then said ambrose more bewildered than ever but hopeful if i were to drink the contents of the green vial i should return to my own epoch precisely and i am sure from what you have told me that your return would be a source of much annoyance to azйdarac it is like the fellow to have established himself in a fat prelacy he was ever the master of circumstance with an eye to his own accommodation and comfort it would hardly please him i am sure if you were to reach the archbishop i am not revengeful by nature but on the other hand it is hard to understand how anyone could have wearied of you said ambrose gallantly as he began to comprehend the situation moriamis smiled that is prettily said and you are really a charming youth in spite of that dismallooking robe i am glad that i rescued you from the druids who would have torn your heart out and offered it to their demon taranit and now you will send me back moriamis frowned a little and then assumed her most seductive air are you in such a hurry to leave your hostess now that you are living in another century than your own a day a week or a month will make no difference in the date of your return i have also retained the formulas of azйdarac and i know how to graduate the potion if necessary the usual period of transportation in time is exactly seven huadred years but the philtre can be strengthened or weakened a little the sun had fallen beyond the pines and a soft twilight was beginning to invade the tower the maidservant had left the room moriamis cane over and seated herself beside ambrose on the rough bench he was occupying still smiling she fixed her amber eyes uyon him with a languid flame in their depths a flame that seemed to brighten as the dusk grew stronger without speaking she began slowly to unbraid her heavy hair from which there emanated a perfume that was subtle and delicious as the perfume of grapeflowers ambrose was embarrassed by this delightful proximity i am not sure that it would be right for me to remain after all what would the archbishop think my dear child the archbishop will not even be born for at least six hundred and fifty years and it will be still longer before you are born and when you return anything that you have done during your stay with me will have happened no less than seven centuries ago which should be long enough to procure the remission of any sin no matter how often repeated like a man who has been taken in the toils of some fantastic drean and finds that the dream is not altogether disagreeable ambrose yielded to this feminine and irrefutable reasoning he hardly knew what was to happen but under the exceptional circumstances indicated by moriamis the rigors of monastic discipline might well be relaxed to almost any conceivable degree without entailing spiritual perdition or even a serious breach of vows iv a month iater moriamis and ambrose were standing beside the druid altar it was late in the evening and a slightly gibbous moon had risen upon the deserted glade and was fringing the treetops with wefted silver the warm breath of the summer night was gentle as the sighing of a woman in slumber must you go after all said moriamis in a pleading and regretful voice it is my duty i must return to clйment with the book of eibon and the other evidence i have collected against azйdarac the words sounded a little unreal to ambrose as he uttered them and he tried very hard but vainly to convince himself of the cogency and validity of his arguments the idyll of his stay with moriamis to which he was oddly unable to attach any true conviction of sin had given to all that preceded it a certain dismal insubstantiality free of all responsibility or restraint in the sheer obliviousness of dreams he had lived like a happy pagan and now he must go back to the drear existence of a nediaeval monk beneath the prompting of an obscure sense of duty i shall not try to hold you moriamis sighed but i shall miss you and remenber you as a worthy lover and a pleasant playmate here is the philtre the green essence was cold and almost hueless in the moonlight as moriamis poured it into a little cup and gave it to ambrose are you sure of its precise efficacy the monk inquired are you sure that i shah return to the inn of bonne jouissance at a time not far subsequent to that of my departure therefrom yea said moriamis for the potion is infallible but stay i have also brought along the other vial the vial of the past take it with you for who knows you may sometime wish to return and visit me again ambrose accepted the red vial and placed it in his robe beside the ancient manual of hyperborean sorcery then after an appropriate farewell to moriamis he drained with sudden resolution the contents of the cup the moonlit glade the gray altar and moriamis all vanished in a swirl of flame and shadow it seemed to ambrose that he was soaring endlessly through fantasmagoric gulfs amid the ceaseless shifting and melting of unstable things the transient forming and fading of irresoluble worlds at the end he found himself sitting once more in the inn of bonne jouissance at what he assumed to be the very same table before which he had sat with the sieur des йmaux it was daylight and the room was full of people among whom he looked in vain for the rubicund face of the innkeeper or the servants and fellowguests he had previously seen all were unfamiliar to him and the furniture was strangely worn and was grimier than he remembered it perceiving the presence of ambrose the people began to eye him with open curiosity and wonderment a tall man with dolorous eyes and lantern jaws came hastily forward and bowed before him with an air that was half servile but full of a prying impertinence what do you wish he asked is this the inn of bonne jouissance the innkeeper stared at ambrose nay it is the inn of haute esperance of which i have been the taverner these thirty years could you not read the sign it was called the inn of bonne jouissance in my fathers time but the name was changed after his death ambrose was filled with consternation but the inn was differently named and was kept by another man when i visited it not long ago he cried in bewilderment the owner was a stout jovial man not in the least like you that would answer the description of my father said the taverner eyeing ambrose more dubiously than ever he has been dead for the full thirty years of which i speak and surely you were not even born at the time of his decease ambrose began to realize what had happened the emerald potion by some error or excess of potcncy had taken him many years beyond his own time into the future i must resume my journey to vyones he said in a bewildered voice without fully comprehending the implications of his situation i have a message for the archbishop clйment and must not delay longer in delivering it but clйment has been dead even longer than my father exclaimed the innkeeper from whence do you come that you are ignorant of this it was plain from his manner that he had begun to doubt the sanity of ambrose others overhearing the strange discussion had begun to crowd about and were plying the monk with jocular and sometimes ribald questions and what of azйdarac the bishop of ximes is he dead too inquired ambrose desperately you mean st azйdarac no doubt he outlived clйment but nevertheless he has been dead and duly canonized for thirtytwo years some say that he did not die but was transported to heaven alive and that his body was never buried in the great mausoleum reared for him at ximes but that is probably a mere legend ambrose was overwhelmed with unspeakable desolation and confusion in the meanwhile the crowd about him had increased and in spite of his robe he was being made the subject of rude remarks and jeers the good brother has lost his wits cried some the wines of averoigne are too strong for him said others what year is this demanded ambrose in his desperation the year of our lord replied the taverner breaking into a derisive laugh and what year did you think it was it was the year when i last visited the inn of bonne jouissance admitted ambrose his declaration was greeted with fresh jeers and laughter hola young sir you were not even conceived at that time the taverner said then seeming to remember something he went on in a more thoughtful tone when i was a child my father told me of a young monk about your age who came to the inn of bonne jouissance one evening in the summer of and vanished inexplicably after drinking a draft of red wine i believe his name was ambrose perhaps you are ambrose and have only just returned from a visit to nowhere he gave a derisory wink and the new jest was taken up and bandied from mouth to mouth among the frequenters af the tavern ambrose was trying to realize the full import of his predicament his mission was now useless through the death or disappearance of azйdarac and no one would remain in all averoigne to recognize him or believe his story he felt the hopelessness of his alienation among unknown years and people suddenly he remembered the red vial given him at parting by moriamis the potion like the green philtre might prove uncertain in its effect but he was seized by an allconsuming desire to escape from the weird embarrassment and wilderment of his present position also he longed for moriamis like a lost child for its mother and the charm of his sojourn in the past was upon him with an irresistible spell ignoring the ribald faces and voices about him he drew the vial from his bosom uncorked it and swallowed the contents v he was back in the forest glade by the gigantic altar moriamis was beside him again lovely and warm and breathing and the moon was still rising above the pinetops it seemed that no more than a few moments could have elapsed since he had said farewell to the beloved enchantress i thought you might return said moriamis and i waited a little while ambrose told her of the singular mishap that had attended his journey in time moriamis nodded gravely the green philtre was more potent than i had supposed she remarked it is fortunate though that the red philtre was equivalently strong and could bring you back to me through all those added years you will have to remain with me now for i possessed only the two vials i hope you are not sorry ambrose proceeded to prove in a somewhat unmonastic manner that her hope was fully justified neither then nor at any other time did moriamis tell him that she herself had strengthened slightly and equally the two philtres by means of the private formula which she had also stolen from azйdarac
