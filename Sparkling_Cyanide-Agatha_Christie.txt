chapter one iris marle rosemary barton died from cyanide poisoning nearly a year ago iris marle was thinking about her sister rosemary barton for nearly a year she had tried to forget the blue face the twisted fingers the difference between that and the lovely happy rosemary of the day before well perhaps not happy she had been ill she was tired and depressed thats why she had killed herself wasnt it but last night rosemarys husband george barton had called her into his study and shown her those letters and now she had to remember the past pictures came into her mind herself as a small child eating bread and milk and rosemary six years older doing school work at a table rosemary going to boarding school and coming home for the holidays rosemary going to live in paris and coming home an elegant beautiful woman with redgold hair and dark blue eyes rosemarys life became full of late breakfasts in bed lunches with girlfriends and evening dances while iris still went to school walked in the parks ate supper at nine oclock and was in bed by ten and then rosemary had married george barton iris still wondered why so many exciting young men had been courting her while george barton was fifteen years older than herself kind pleasant and extremely dull it wasnt money rosemary already had uncle pauls money paul bennett wasnt really an uncle he had been in love with their mother but she had chosen another poorer man hector marle paul had accepted his defeat and remained a family friend he had become known as uncle paul and was godfather to rosemary when he died he left his entire fortune to his thirteenyearold goddaughter so why had the rich and beautiful rosemary married boring george barton she hadnt loved him but she had been happy with him and was very fond of him a year later iris and rosemarys mother viola marle had died their father hector had died many years before and so at the age of seventeen iris went to live with rosemary and george in elvaston square iris had not seen much of her sister in those days rosemary was always out shopping or going to parties but she had seemed happy enough until that day a week before it happened when iris had entered rosemarys sitting room to find her sitting at her desk and weeping bitterly iris had never seen rosemary cry before it frightened her although rosemary had been ill with influenza and she knew that it could leave you depressed rosemary whats wrong she cried rosemary wiped her tearstained face nothing she said angrily then she stood up and ran out of the room puzzled iris walked over to the table and saw her own name on a page of notepaper rosemary had been writing to her she read the note darling iris there isnt any point in making a will because my money goes to you anyway but id like some of my things to be given to particular people to george the jewellery hes given me to gloria king my cigarette case to maisie the note stopped there what did it mean rosemary wasnt going to die she had been very ill but she was better now my money goes to you anyway iris had always thought uncle pauls fortune would go to george if rosemary died but it said here that the money would come to her instead that did make things rather less unfair she was surprised by the thought had she felt it was unfair for rosemary to get all uncle pauls money perhaps deep in her heart she had rosemary always had everything parties pretty dresses young men in love with her and an adoring husband iris picked up the unfinished letter and put it safely away in one the drawers of the desk after the fatal birthday party it was used to prove that rosemary had been depressed after her illness and might have been considering suicide depression after influenza was the verdict given at the inquest now iris wondered how she had not been able to see the truth after rosemarys funeral the family lawyer had explained the details of paul bennetts will to iris rosemary had inherited his fortune and she was meant to pass it on to her own children when she died but if she died childless the money would go to iris when she reached the age of twentyone or when she got married george invited iris to continue living with him he suggested that her aunt mrs lucilla drake should also come and live with them mrs drake had very little money of her own because her son spent it all and so she was very pleased by georges invitation iris had happily agreed to the arrangement george treated her like a younger sister and mrs drake who was a rather silly woman let her do just as she pleased the new household settled down comfortably together six months after rosemarys death iris had gone up into the attic of the house to look for a favourite jumper which was packed away in a suitcase of unused clothes searching through the suitcase she found an old robe that had belonged to rosemary and felt something in one of the pockets she reached into the pocket and pulled out a letter in rosemarys handwriting darling i know you dont mean it we love each other we cant just say goodbye we belong together for ever and ever i dont care what people say love matters more than anything you once said that life was nothing without me and now you say that our relationship must end but i cant live without you cant cant cant george will understand that it isnt right to live together if you dont love each other anymore well be wonderfully happy darling but we must be brave i shant tell george until after my birthday oh darling the letter ended here so rosemary had had a lover and she had planned to go away with him who was this unknown man did he love rosemary as much as she loved him he must have done and yet he had suggested ending it was he tired of her it seemed that he had wanted to end the affair but that rosemary had disagreed rosemary had had many admirers but there had been no one special had there iris frowned could it have been stephen farraday people said he was a brilliant politician a possible future prime minister was that the attraction surely rosemary couldnt really have loved such a cold unemotional man but it must be stephen farraday because if it wasnt it had to be anthony browne and iris didnt want it to be anthony browne anthony had been devoted to rosemary but he had disappeared after her death and noone had seen him since of course he travelled a lot he had mentioned south america canada uganda and the usa iris thought he was actually american although his accent was very slight and there was no reason why he should have continued to visit the rest of them he was rosemarys friend after all but iris didnt want him to have been rosemarys lover that would hurt terribly she wanted to throw the letter away but something stopped her from doing it one day it might be necessary to show someone that letter to explain why rosemary killed herself so instead she took it downstairs and locked it in her jewellery box rosemary had died in november in may iris assisted by her aunt lucilla had entered londons social world she went to lunches teas and dances but she didnt enjoy them very much it was at a rather boring dance at the end of june that she had heard someone behind her say iris marle she had turned round and looked straight into anthony brownes handsome face you probably dont remember me he said but of course i do she smiled oh thats splendid its been such a long time since i saw you i know not since rosemarys birthday par she stopped in distress rosemarys birthday party rosemarys suicide she wouldnt think of it she would not im terribly sorry he said quickly i shouldnt have reminded you iris swallowed hard its all right please forgive me shall we dance she nodded and floated onto the dance floor in his arms where have you been all this time she heard herself asking travelling on business i see so why have you come back now he smiled to see you iris marle since then iris had seen anthony at least once a week she walked with him in the park sat next to him at dinner parties danced with him but he never came to elvaston square always cleverly managing to avoid accepting her invitations she began to wonder why was it perhaps because he and rosemary had been lovers there in the past then one day george had suddenly questioned her about the relationship whos this anthony browne youre seeing he asked what do you know about him she stared at him in surprise tony he was a friend of rosemarys george blinked oh yes of course he was well you should be careful of the fellow youre a very rich young woman you know tony has plenty of money she cried angrily why hes staying at claridges hotel george smiled very respectable and expensive all the same my dear nobody knows much about him he doesnt come to this house does he no and i can see why if youre so horrid about him im simply warning you ill talk to lucilla george did mention anthony browne to aunt lucilla but she did not pay much attention to him at the time because her attention was focused on a telegram from her beloved son in rio de janeiro can you send me two hundred pounds it said life or death victor victor knows i dont have much money so he wouldnt ask for help unless it was an emergency im so afraid hell shoot himself i would never forgive myself if i didnt do what he asked george sighed ill find out exactly what sort of trouble victors in but you should let him try to get out of trouble by himself lucilla hell never take any responsibility for himself otherwise youre cruel george the poor boy has always been unlucky george kept his thoughts about victor to himself and decided to ask his efficient secretary to deal with it he simply said ill get ruth to send a telegram at once we should know by tomorrow the two hundred pounds was eventually reduced to fifty which george paid himself iris told george how much she admired his kindness well theres always one loser in the family he said who must be supported by the others but victor isnt your family couldnt i do it youre always saying how rich i am he smiled not until youre twentyone and i hope you wont do it then but ill give you one piece of advice when someone threatens to end his life unless he gets two hundred pounds at once twenty pounds will usually be enough and ten will do you can always cut down the amount victor would never kill himself the people who threaten suicide never do it never what about rosemary thought iris since rosemarys death george seemed older and heavier he had grown increasingly absentminded and spent a lot of time deep in thought something serious seemed to be worrying him iris sometimes noticed him staring at her with a puzzled look on his face then he started returning early from work and going straight into his study she had followed him in there one afternoon and found him sitting at his desk staring into space when she asked him what the matter was he replied quickly nothing as time went on he began to ask peculiar questions such as iris did rosemary ever talk to you of course george about what oh herself her friends whether she was happy that sort of thing iris was afraid that george had found out about rosemarys affair but she didnt want to hurt him and rosemary had never said anything so she shook her head oh well it doesnt matter he sighed another day he asked her who rosemarys best friends had been gloria king and maisie atwell she replied would she have told her secrets to them i dont know what sort of secrets do you mean well was she afraid of anybody did she have any enemies iris stared at him in astonishment and his face reddened i just wondered the next day he asked her how well rosemary knew the farradays i really dont know george but she was interested in politics only after she met the farradays in switzerland she never thought about political matters before that i think stephen farraday got her interested in the subject what did sandra farraday think about that she might resent him having a friendship with another woman iris felt uncomfortable perhaps she agreed george suddenly changed the subject are you still seeing anthony browne yes isnt his business something to do with armaments he has never said well he certainly spent a lot of time with lord dewsbury last year and dewsbury is the chairman of united arms ltd rosemary saw a lot of browne too didnt she he took her dancing yes i was surprised that she wanted him at her birthday party though she hadnt known him for long he dances very well a picture of the fatal party at the luxembourg restaurant flashed across iriss mind the round table the soft lights the seven guests herself anthony rosemary stephen farraday ruth lessing george and stephens wife lady alexandra known to her friends as sandra that was the first time iris had met tony properly before then he had just been a name a shadow in the hall waiting to escort rosemary out to yet another party she pulled her mind back into the present to hear george saying well do ask browne to dinner one night my dear id like to meet him again iris was delighted she gave georges invitation to tony and he accepted but on the day of the dinner he suddenly had to leave london on a business matter and couldnt come after all in july george announced that he had bought a house called little priors in the sussex countryside will it need decorating asked mrs drake oh ruth is arranging all that for us ruth lessing georges efficient secretary was pleasant and goodlooking in a hard blackandwhite kind of way george was devoted to her and relied on her completely lucilla drake was annoyed george dear women do like to arrange the colour scheme of their own drawing room george looked upset i wanted it to be a surprise im sure ruth will have made it perfect said iris shes so clever what shall we do down there is there a tennis court yes and its only fourteen miles to the sea and well have neighbours we know too the farradays own a house nearby they spent most of august and september in sussex little priors was a handsome house tastefully furnished and decorated visitors came to stay at the weekends there were tennis parties and dinners with the farradays sandra farraday introduced them to the rest of their neighbours and advised george about buying horses stephen was often away in london working on political business iris suspected that he was deliberately avoiding the family at little priors the household had returned to london in october and iris had hoped that perhaps george would start behaving normally again but then late last night he had knocked on her bedroom door and asked her to come into his study for a talk halfasleep she had agreed downstairs in the study he invited her to sit down is anything the matter george she asked as he lit a cigarette with a shaking hand he looked really ill i cant go on alone you must tell me if you think its possible he rubbed his hand over his face youll understand when ive shown you these he handed iris two neatly printed letters the first one said your wife didnt commit suicide she was killed the second said rosemary was murdered they came about three months ago george continued at first i thought it was a cruel joke but then i began to think why would rosemary have killed herself lots of people have influenza and feel a bit depressed afterwards but rosemary wouldnt kill herself just because she was unhappy she might threaten to but she wouldnt actually do it but what other explanation could there be george they found the cyanide poison in her handbag i know but ever since these letters came ive been thinking about it and i believe theyre true thats why i asked you if rosemary had enemies or was afraid of anyone whoever killed her must have had a reason and you must help me find out iris youve got to remember that night in every detail because if she was killed you see the murderer must have been sitting at that table chapter two ruth lessing ruth lessing a welldressed darkhaired woman of twenty nine was devoted to george barton when she had first come to work for him six years ago at the age of twentythree she had discovered that he was a very disorganized and inefficient man being a businesslike young woman she had immediately taken control of his affairs she had saved him time and money chosen his friends and advised him on his business decisions george rosemary and iris all called her ruth and she spent a lot of time with them at the house in elvaston square last year in early november not long before rosemarys death george had spoken to ruth about victor drake i want you to do a rather unpleasant job for me ruth he said one morning she nodded my wifes cousin victor drake is a very bad man he has ruined his mother lucilla who has given him almost all her savings he was caught forging a cheque while he was at oxford university and the family sent him abroad he has travelled all over the world but he never makes a success of anything he does hes in london at the moment and has written to ask for money ive made an appointment to meet him at twelve oclock today at his hotel and i want you to go in my place i believe the matter can be kept absolutely businesslike if its managed by a third person what do you want me to offer him a hundred pounds in cash and a ticket to buenos aires the money will be given to him as he gets on the boat ruth smiled you want to be sure he actually leaves indeed are you sure you dont mind doing this for me of course not heres his ticket ive booked him onto the san cristobal which sails from tilbury docks tomorrow ruth put the ticket into her handbag where do i meet him at the rupert hotel russell square my dear what would i do without you george put a hand on her shoulder affectionately youre the kindest dearest girl in the world victor drake was a very attractive man but ruth could sense the cold calculating personality hidden beneath his obvious charm he greeted her with delight so youre georges messenger what a wonderful surprise coolly she made georges offer and victor agreed to the deal at once a hundred pounds not bad i would have taken sixty but dont tell george and whos coming to see me off on the san cristobal you my dear how delightful his dark eyes smiled in his sunburned face youve been with barton for six years havent you miss lessing and he wouldnt know what to do without you oh yes i know all about you my dear how do you know asked ruth sharply victor grinned rosemary told me rosemary she was very nice to me she gave me a hundred pounds actually he laughed although she disapproved of his bad behaviour ruth found herself laughing too thats too bad of you mr drake not at all im a professional beggar with an excellent technique my mother for example will always send money if i send a telegram suggesting suicide you should be ashamed of yourself oh i am im a bad man miss lessing but i do enjoy myself greatly ive lived a very interesting life ive been an actor a shopkeeper a waiter a builder a porter and a circus assistant i stood for president in a south american republic ive been in prison and ive never done an honest job or paid my own bills ruth knew she should be horrified but victor drake managed to make evil seem amusing and youre not so good yourself ruth he was looking at her closely now you worship success george shouldnt have married that little fool rosemary he would have done much better to marry you rosemarys lovely but shes got no brains at all shes the kind of woman that men always fall in love with but never stay with now you well if a man fell in love with you he would never grow tired of it but george wouldnt fall in love with me she cried oh ruth if anything happened to rosemary george would marry you at once you know that as well i do you could twist him round your little finger its true thought ruth suddenly very angry if it werent for rosemary i could make george marry me victor was watching her with amusement he enjoyed putting ideas into peoples heads or showing them the ideas that were already there soon after ruth returned to work that afternoon rosemary had called her on the telephone oh ruth she said colonel race wont be here in time for my party so ask george who he would like to invite instead we need another man there are four women coming iris sandra farraday and i cant remember the other one im the fourth you very kindly asked me oh of course id forgotten rosemary laughed and ended the call at that moment ruth lessing realized that she hated rosemary barton hated her for being rich and beautiful and careless and brainless she didnt need to work in an office everything had been handed to her on a golden plate love affairs a devoted husband i wish you were dead ruth said to the silent telephone chapter three anthony browne anthony browne knew he had been a fool to get involved with rosemary barton after all he wasnt staying at claridges hotel for pleasure he was in london to work but rosemary was beautiful enough to excuse the fact that he was neglecting his business affairs for a little while luckily his fascination with her soon began to fade and he knew that it wasnt love after all but they could still have a good time together rosemary danced wonderfully and whenever they went out other men turned round to stare at her it was very pleasant as long as you didnt want to talk to her she couldnt even listen intelligently but he had taken her out danced with her kissed her in taxis and was on the way to making a bit of a fool of himself over her until that incredible day he remembered the expectant look in her dark blue eyes as she said softly anthony browne is a nice name its very respectable he replied lightly there was an advisor to king henry the eighth called anthony browne but you must be from the italian branch of the family because of my brown skin i had a spanish mother oh that explains it mr anthony browne youre very fond of my name he laughed well its nicer than tony morelli he couldnt believe it he caught hold of her arm where did you hear that name his voice was suddenly dangerous who told you she laughed in delight at his reaction someone who recognized you who this is serious rosemary my wicked cousin victor drake ive never met him he probably wasnt using that name when you knew him i expect he had chosen to give a false one in order to save the family embarrassment anthony said slowly i see so you mean that we met in prison then yes i saw victor recently and i was telling him what a disgrace to the family he was when he grinned and said you arent so perfect yourself sweetheart i saw you last night dancing with a chap who calls himself anthony browne in prison we knew him as tony morelli anthony smiled well id like to see him again we exprisoners must stick together youre too late he sailed to south america yesterday so youre the only person now who knows my guilty secret rosemary nodded and i wont tell you had better not you dont want your pretty face slashed do you there are people around who are very happy to ruin a girls beauty and murder doesnt only happen in books and films it happens in real life too are you threatening me tony im warning you forget the name tony morelli do you understand but i dont mind tony its exciting to meet a criminal you shouldnt be ashamed he looked at her coldly wondering how he could ever have cared for her she was just a silly girl with a pretty face he would have to leave he couldnt trust her to keep his secret she smiled her enchanting smile dont look so fierce will you take me to the jarrows dance next week i wont be here im going away not before my birthday party you cant ive been very ill and you mustnt upset me you must come he was going to refuse but at that moment through the open parlour door he saw iris marle coming down the stairs tall and slim with dark hair and grey eyes and anthony browne changed his mind chapter four stephen farraday from an early age stephen farraday had been determined to succeed in life he was a quiet wellbehaved boy who worked hard enough at school to earn a place at oxford university he graduated at the age of twentytwo leaving his college with a reputation as a clever public speaker a talent for writing newspaper articles some useful friends and an ambition to work in politics naturally shy he worked hard to develop an excellent social manner with the occasional flash of brilliance and soon people began to say that young man will go far he joined the conservative party and was quickly elected to a parliamentary seat as he triumphantly entered the house of commons for the first time stephen knew he had chosen the right career however he soon realized that he was a very unimportant member of the government how could he rise to a higher position people didnt trust young politicians so he needed something more than his own talents to help him he needed the help of a powerful political family marriage was the answer he decided marriage to a wellconnected woman who would share his life and his ambitions who would give him children and be proud of his success one day he was invited to a party at kidderminster house in mayfair the kidderminsters were one of the most powerful political families in england lord and lady kidderminster had five daughters three of them beautiful stephen was leaning beside a window about twenty minutes after arriving at the party when he noticed a tall fair girl standing by the refreshment table looking rather lost he recognized her as lady alexandra hayle the least attractive of the kidderminsters five daughters she did not have the same style and confidence as her prettier sisters and he could see that she was shy and uncomfortable suddenly stephen recognized his chance he walked across to stand beside her at the table and picked up a sandwich then turning to her he said do you mind if i talk to you i dont know many people here and i can see you dont either as he had guessed the girl was too embarrassed to tell him who she really was they began talking together stephen mentioned a play which she had also seen dealing with some aspect of the social services soon they were deep in a discussion about politics stephen was careful not to overdo things when he saw lady kidderminster entering the room looking for her daughter he said goodbye and left the party he did not want to be introduced to her just yet for several days afterwards he watched kidderminster house waiting for the chance to see lady alexandra alone his patience was rewarded one morning when she came out with a small dog and walked towards hyde park stephen hurried ahead so that when sandra entered through the park gates he was already walking along the path towards her as they passed one another he stopped in delighted surprise i say what luck i wondered if id ever see you again i didnt tell you my name the other day im stephen farraday an unimportant member of parliament she blushed and said im alexandra sandra hayle his reaction was perfectly judged surprise embarrassment dismay lady alexandra oh dear you must have thought i was so rude at the party i should have known it doesnt matter mr farraday she reassured him quickly please dont be upset why dont we walk to down to the river after that they often met in the park they discussed politics and he discovered that she was an intelligent and sympathetic woman they became friends and soon stephen was invited to dinner at kidderminster house that evening he made a good impression on lord and lady kidderminster who described him as a useful young man to know two months later stephen proposed to sandra sandra i love you and i want you to marry me i believe that i shall be a very successful man one day you wont be ashamed of your choice i promise im not ashamed then you do care for me darling didnt you know i had hoped but i wasnt sure ive loved you since i first saw you across the room and came over to speak to you i was never more terrified in my life i think i loved you then too sandras parents were not happy that she wanted to marry a man from an ordinary family who held an unimportant parliamentary position but lord kidderminster knew his quiet daughters determined nature if she wanted farraday she would have him the fellow has got a promising career ahead of him he admitted and the conservative party could certainly do with some young and talented new members lady kidderminster agreed reluctantly then we will have to help him so alexandra hayle married stephen farraday and they moved into a charming house in westminster soon afterwards sandras godmother died and left her a delightful old house in the country called fairhaven stephen returned to parliament with new energy his connection with the kidderminsters promised him a rapid rise in his career and his wife was the perfect partner he had imagined his ideal companion life was turning out just as he had planned at thirtytwo success already lay within his reach and then the farradays took a holiday in st moritz a skiing resort in the swiss alps and stephen saw rosemary barton across the hotel lounge and the lie he had told to his wife became the truth at last across a room he fell deeply crazily desperately in love he had always believed that he was not a passionate man sensual pleasure held little interest for him so to fall in love like an inexperienced boy was a terrible shock he could think of nothing but rosemarys lovely face her red gold hair her perfect figure he couldnt eat or sleep they went skiing together danced together and as he held her in his arms he wanted her more than anything on earth two weeks after they returned to london he became rosemarys lover their mad affair lasted for six months stephen worked at the house of commons spoke at political meetings and thought only of rosemary their secret meetings her warm embrace it was a sensual feverish dream and after the dream the sudden awakening it was like coming out of a tunnel into daylight one day he was a passionate lover the next day he was stephen farraday again thinking that perhaps they shouldnt meet quite so often they had taken some serious risks what if sandra guessed the truth some of his excuses for absence lately had been pretty weak most women would have become suspicious by now he needed to escape he took a few days off work and went down to fairhaven with sandra it was peaceful sitting in the gardens with his wife playing golf walking in the countryside he felt like he was recovering from an illness he had told rosemary not to write to him in sussex it was too dangerous even though sandra never asked him who his letters were from so when he recognized rosemarys writing on an envelope at the breakfast table he frowned in annoyance and took it into his study to read over several pages rosemary had written that she adored him loved him more than ever couldnt bear not to see him for five whole days he thought that it was sweet of her to write but she shouldnt have done it why couldnt she wait until he got back to london another letter arrived the next morning this time stephen thought sandras eyes rested on it for a couple of seconds but she didnt say anything after breakfast he drove to the nearest town to call rosemary from a public telephone box hello rosemary stephen darling oh i have missed you have you missed me yes of course but dont write to me any more its not safe dont be silly darling what does it matter im thinking of you too rosemary oh i dont care what happens to me well i care sweetheart when are you coming back tuesday cant you make an excuse and come up today im afraid it isnt possible when stephen rang off he felt exhausted rosemary and he must be more careful in future after that things began to get difficult stephen was working so hard that it was impossible to give much time to rosemary but she didnt understand she wasnt interested in his career she just wanted him to tell her again and again that he loved her surely he thought she must know that by now she made sudden impossible demands couldnt he go down to the south of france and she could meet him there one of those places where you never saw anyone you knew stephen said that there was no such place in the world at the most unlikely spots you always met some old school friend that you hadnt seen for years well it wouldnt really matter would it she said he felt suddenly cold what do you mean she smiled at him darling its stupid to go on trying to keep this a secret so lets stop pretending george will divorce me and your wife will divorce you and then we can get married disaster ruin i wouldnt let you do such a thing he said but darling it doesnt matter what other people think of us it matters to me my dear a scandal of that kind would destroy my career but there are hundreds of other things that you could do and you dont need to do anything anyway ive got lots of money of my own we could travel the world who on earth did she think he was at that moment the spell was finally broken rosemary had a beautiful face and the brains of a chicken and if stephen wasnt careful she would ruin his life he said the things that men always say in these situations they must end it for her sake he couldnt risk bringing unhappiness on her but she had replied that she adored him she couldnt live without him they must tell the truth she would tell george and george would divorce her sandra would divorce stephen too he had no doubt about that and his career would not survive the scandal everything ruined because of his lust for a silly woman he would lose everything he would lose sandra with a shock of surprise stephen realized that losing sandra was his greatest fear his dear loyal sandra no somehow he must keep rosemary quiet i wont do anything until after my birthday rosemary had said it would be too cruel dear george is making such a fuss about it but if stephen told her clearly that he no longer loved her she might very well go to george in hysterics she might even go to sandra he could hear rosemary saying tearfully he says he doesnt care any more but hes just being loyal to you i know youll agree that when people love each other honesty is the only way so im asking you to give him his freedom and sandra would free him she wouldnt believe that stephen truly loved her how could she if rosemary showed her the letters he had been stupid enough to write he had never written such letters to sandra its a pity that we dont live in the days of the borgias he thought a glass of poisoned champagne was about the only thing that would keep rosemary quiet and then a week later there was cyanide in rosemarys champagne glass and across the table his eyes met sandras chapter five alexandra farraday sandra farraday had loved stephen from the moment he first spoke to her at kidderminster house pretending not to know who she was she had realized that he had known soon after their marriage one day when he was describing a clever piece of political strategy she had recognized the same tactics he had used to win her she had always accepted that he did not love her in the same fierce way that she loved him she thought that he wasnt actually capable of it but she understood the job he wanted her to do he needed her practical help her brains and her connections he didnt want her heart but she knew that he liked her and enjoyed her company so she hid her passionate devotion from him and looked forward to a future full of friendship and affection and then stephen met rosemary barton in st moritz sandra wondered how he could imagine that she didnt know about them she had known from the moment he first looked at the woman she had known the very day the woman became his mistress she knew the perfume the woman used her pride had protected her she would never show that she was hurt never beg never protest and she had one small piece of comfort stephen didnt want to leave her she knew that it was only for the sake of his career but he wouldnt leave and some day the affair would end never for one minute did sandra think of leaving him stephen was her life her whole existence what did he see in the girl she was very beautiful but she was also brainless silly and stupid sandra believed that stephen would get tired of rosemary in time his main interest in life was his work he had a fine political brain and was destined for great things surely once the attraction began to fade he would remember that fact when they went down to fairhaven stephen had seemed more like himself and hope rose in her heart he still wanted her close to him and asked for her advice for the moment he had escaped from that woman if only he would end the affair then they went back to london and it all began again stephen looked tired and ill he couldnt concentrate on his work sandra thought she knew why he was deciding to destroy everything he cared about most it was madness but stephen would not be the first man who had sacrificed his career for a beautiful woman and been sorry afterwards how beautiful rosemary had looked that night at luxembourg as she stood before the mirror in the ladies cloak room fixing her makeup she looked thin and pale after her recent illness oh this horrid flu has exhausted me she exclaimed i look awful and i still feel weak and headachy you havent got an aspirin have you sandra no but ive got a sachet of headache powder sandra had taken the paper packet from her handbag and given it to rosemary just as ruth lessing came up to take her place at the mirror then they had gone out to join the men in the hall sandra rosemary ruth lessing and rosemarys sister iris as they walked into the dining room there had been no warning that one of them would never go through that doorway again alive chapter six george barton george barton had always been crazy about rosemary but when he asked her to marry him he thought she would just laugh at him after all he knew she didnt love him to his amazement however she accepted his offer i know i will feel settled and happy and safe with you im sick of being in love it always goes wrong i like you george youre funny and sweet and you think im wonderful thats what i want amazed and delighted by her unexpected decision george had answered unsteadily well be as happy as kings and they had been happy george had always known that rosemary wouldnt be content with a dull man like him that she would have affairs but he knew that she would always come back to him her affection for him existed quite separately from her love affairs he had not minded her flirtations with various young men but when she began a serious affair he discovered that it was a different matter he had known immediately sensing her excitement and on the day when he had gone into her sitting room and she had quickly covered up the letter she was writing he had guessed she was writing to her lover when she left the room taking the letter with her he crossed to the desk and picked up the blotting paper she had used to dry the ink on the page he had held it up to the mirror on the wall and read the words my own beloved darling a wave of anger had swept over him who was it that fellow browne or stephen farraday they had both been flirting with her he had caught sight of his reflection in the mirror his eyes were red he looked as if he was about to collapse well he would never suffer like that again rosemary had been dead for nearly a year now and so they were both at peace and it was time to concentrate on his plan he would speak to colonel race first and see what he thought of the anonymous letters and then he had it all worked out the date november nd which was all souls day that was a clever detail the place the luxembourg the same table and the same guests anthony browne stephen and sandra farraday ruth iris and himself he would also invite race who had been invited to the original dinner but had been unable to attend and there would also be one extra empty place chapter seven it was late october and at little priors george bartons country house lucilla drake was busily organizing the familys return from sussex to london for the winter as she considered the many housekeeping matters that must be managed she looked worriedly across at iris who was resting on a sofa the girl seemed pale and tired my dear you look as though you havent slept youre black under the eyes i think the air here is unhealthy this house is in a hollow if george had consulted me instead of miss lessing its a great mistake to encourage her to think herself one of the family but aunt ruth is practically one of the family mrs drake sniffed she intends to be thats quite clear but thats unacceptable george must be protected and i think you should tell him that marriage to miss lessing is out of the question iris was surprised i had never thought of george marrying ruth wouldnt it be rather nice i think she would make him a very good wife george is very well looked after already i am perfectly able to see to his comfort and his health what does a young woman out of an office know about housekeeping iris smiled poor aunt lucilla romance was so far back in the past for her now that she had probably forgotten what it meant if indeed it had ever meant much lucilla had been the halfsister of iris and rosemarys father hector she was nearly forty when she met and married the elderly reverend caleb drake who died two years later leaving her with a baby son being a mother had been the greatest experience of lucilla drakes life her son victor had turned out to be a problem but she refused to see anything wrong in him except a slight weakness of character she thought her dear boy was too trusting too easily influenced by bad friends he was unlucky he was too innocent and therefore deceived by wicked men she knew how much victor hated asking her for money but when the poor boy was really in trouble who else could he ask georges invitation to come and live with him and iris had come at a moment when she had been in danger of real poverty she had been happy and comfortable with them and did not like the thought of being replaced by a young woman who she believed would only be marrying george for his money thank goodness there was at least one person who could see what ruth lessing was planning to do chapter eight i wish they had never come to little priors sandra exclaimed bitterly as george and iris left fairfield after having lunch with the farradays stephen turned to look at her in surprise i didnt know you felt like that about them too he said neighbours are different in the country you have to be either friends or enemies you cant just see people occasionally as you can in london and so now weve got to go to this extraordinary party they were both silent remembering the scene at lunch where george bartons behaviour had been noticeably strange he had been extremely friendly but there had been a clear undercurrent of excitement in him and then that sudden unexpected invitation a party for iriss eighteenth birthday he did hope the farradays would both come stephen and sandra had been so kind to them here in sussex he had insisted on setting the date right then i thought perhaps one day the week after next wednesday or thursday thursday is november nd would that be all right but well arrange any day that suits you both it was an invitation that you couldnt politely refuse stephen had noticed iris marle blushing with embarrassment as sandra smilingly accepted and said that thursday november nd would suit them very well now voicing his thoughts stephen said sharply we dont have to go we can make some excuse sandra turned to look at him hell just change the date he seems very anxious for us to come i cant think why its iriss party and i doubt she particularly wants us there no sandra sounded thoughtful you know this party is to be at the luxembourg but thats ridiculous he was shocked the man must be mad we will certainly refuse to go the whole thing with rosemarys death was terribly unpleasant the publicity the pictures in the papers doesnt he realize how disagreeable it would be for us george told me his reason stephen he said that iris has avoided the luxembourg ever since that night but he consulted a psychiatrist who said that after a bad shock the cause of the trouble must be faced not avoided george believes it would help iris forget all her unhappy memories if he planned a pleasant party at the same restaurant with as far as possible the same guests at the table how delightful stephen observed ironically he was horrified by the thought do you really mind stephen i think its a rather nasty idea but if you dont mind i do mind very much but george made it impossible to refuse you dont have to go ill go and you can cancel at the last minute with a headache or something sandra lifted her chin that would be cowardly no stephen if you go i go after all she laid her hand on his arm however little our marriage means it should at least mean sharing our difficulties he stared her in horror why do you say that however little our marriage means she looked back at him calmly well isnt it true no a thousand times no our marriage means everything to me she smiled i suppose we do make a good partnership dont we of course we do but thats not what i meant stephen was finding it hard to breathe he took her hand in both of his holding it very tightly sandra he said shakily dont you know that you mean the world to me then suddenly she was in his arms and he was holding her close and kissing her sandra sandra darling i love you ive been so afraid i would lose you because of rosemary she asked yes he let her go and stepped back ashamed you knew of course and you understand she shook her head no i dont think i ever will did you love her not really it was you i loved from the first moment you saw me across the room she reminded him suddenly angry dont repeat that lie for it was a lie he answered thoughtfully yes it was but im beginning to believe that it was actually true you were not in love with me she said bitterly i had never been in love i was a passionless man i was even proud of my emotional control and then i did fall in love across a room in st moritz it was a silly violent love like a summer storm brief unreal and quickly over he paused it was here at fairhaven that i realized that your love was the only thing in life that mattered to me i thought you were planning to go away with her with rosemary he gave a short laugh that would have been penal servitude for life didnt she want you to go away with her yes she did what happened stephen drew a deep breath the luxembourg happened they both fell silent remembering then sandra asked what are we going to do well face it together said stephen and go to this horrible party whatever georges reason for it may be you dont believe his story about iris no do you it could be true but its not the real reason what do you think this party is sandra she met his eyes i think its a trap chapter nine on the way back from lunch with the farradays at fairfield iris turned to george do you mind if i go for a walk ive got an awful headache my poor child of course i wont come with you though i have a friend coming to visit me this afternoon right then goodbye till teatime iris walked away through a wood and up a nearby hill when she reached the top she stopped and sat down on a fallen tree the october afternoon was damp and grey clouds promised more rain she was looking down into the valley when she heard a slight rustle in the trees behind her looking round she saw anthony browne walking towards her tony she cried how did you know where i was he sat down and took out his cigarette case i have an excellent pair of binoculars i knew you were having lunch with the farradays so i spied on you from the hillside and followed you when you left he smiled and lit his cigarette why didnt you come to the house like an ordinary person im not an ordinary person said anthony in a shocked tone im very extraordinary i think you are he looked at her quickly then he said is anything the matter no at least she drew a deep breath i hate being down here i want to go back to london youre going soon arent you next week so this was a farewell party at the farradays it wasnt a party just lunch do you like the farradays not very much although theyve been very nice to us stephen always seems to me rather arrogant and stupid hes not stupid hes just one of the usual unhappy successes unhappy most successes are unhappy thats why they are successes they have to reassure themselves about who they are by achieving something that the world will notice the happy people are failures because they are so content in themselves that they dont care what other people think like me they are also usually very pleasant company again like me you have a very good opinion of yourself im just drawing attention to my good points in case you havent noticed them iris laughed suddenly feeling much happier she glanced at her watch come and have tea and give a few more people the benefit of your pleasant company anthony shook his head i cant stay long why will you never come to the house she demanded there must be a reason anthony shrugged his shoulders george doesnt like me why are you here then do you have business in this part of the world very important business with you i came to ask you a question iris his eyes were very serious do you trust me its the most important question in the world to me do you trust me after a brief moment she answered yes then will you come up to london now and marry me without telling anybody she stared at him i couldnt you do love me dont you yes anthony she heard herself say but you wont come and marry me by special licence at the church of saint elfrida in bloomsbury i cant george would be so hurt and aunt lucilla would never forgive me and im not old enough anyway im only eighteen i cant marry without legal consent until im twentyone youd have to lie about your age but why whats the point of it you have to trust my reasons lets say that it is the simplest way but never mind iris said fearfully if george only knew you a little better come back with me now it will only be him and aunt lucilla are you sure i thought i saw a man going up your drive and i believe i recognized him as someone i had met oh yes i forgot george was expecting someone the man i thought i saw was a man called colonel race its very likely iris agreed george does know a colonel race he was coming to dinner on that night when rosemary she broke off and drew a deep breath anthony did you ever think that rosemary might not have committed suicide that she might have been murdered good heavens iris certainly not what put such a thought into your head she wanted to tell him the incredible story of georges anonymous letters but instead she said slowly it was just an idea well forget it my darling he pulled her to her feet and kissed her lightly on the cheek chapter ten colonel race was a tall militarylooking man in his sixties with a tanned face short grey hair and intelligent dark eyes race was twenty years older than george barton who he had known ever since george was a boy they were not particularly close friends race was an outdoors type of man who had spent most of his life abroad working for british intelligence while george was definitely a city gentleman at this moment race was wondering just why young george had asked him to come down to see him in sussex george had always been a cautious practical sensible man but this afternoon he seemed very nervous race took his pipe out of his mouth and looked across at george so young george whats the trouble i need your advice race and your help almost a year ago you were invited to dine with us in london at the luxembourg but you had to go abroad at the last minute race nodded to south africa at that dinner party my wife died i know i read about it didnt mention it now or offer you sympathy because i didnt want to upset you but i am sorry you know that oh yes yes but thats not the point my wife was supposed to have committed suicide races eyebrows rose supposed read these george handed the two letters to race anonymous letters who do you think wrote them george i dont know i dont care but i believe theyre true my wife was murdered race put down his pipe did you suspect this at the time did the police no i just accepted the verdict there was no suggestion of anything except suicide the cyanide was in her handbag so it seemed at the time quite straightforward had she ever threatened to commit suicide never rosemary loved life race had only met georges wife once he had thought her beautiful but stupid but not a depressive what was the medical evidence as to her state of mind rosemarys own doctor was away on holiday at the time his partner looked after rosemary when she had the influenza and he said it could cause serious depression later rosemarys own doctor told me that he was very surprised at what had happened rosemary was not the suicidal type he said george paused it was then that i realized how unlikely rosemarys suicide was she could certainly get very emotional about things and she would sometimes act without thinking but i have never known her want to abandon life completely whats more if rosemary had wanted to kill herself she would never have done it that way it was painful and ugly an overdose of sleeping medicine would be far more likely i agree was there any evidence as to how she obtained the cyanide no but she had been staying with friends in the country and they had used cyanide to destroy a wasps nest there one day it was thought that she might have taken some then so there was no natural disposition to commit suicide nor any preparation for it but there cant have been any evidence for murder or the police would have found it theyre quite clever you know just the idea of murder would have seemed incredible then but it didnt seem so to you six months later george said slowly i think i must have been subconsciously unsatisfied all along so when i saw the thing written down it made sense at once race nodded so who do you suspect george looked ill if rosemary was killed one of those people at the table one of our friends must have done it no one else came near us who poured the wine charles the head waiter at the luxembourg everybody knew charles it was impossible to imagine that he would deliberately poison a client and the waiter who served us was giuseppe who always looks after me there hes a delightful fellow so who was at the dinner party stephen farraday the mp his wife lady alexandra my secretary ruth lessing a fellow called anthony browne rosemarys sister iris and myself there should have been eight guests but when you cancelled we couldnt think of anybody else to ask at the last minute where were you all sitting i had sandra farraday on my right anthony browne sat next to her then rosemary stephen iris and ruth lessing who sat on my left had your wife drunk champagne earlier in the evening yes the glasses had been filled up several times it happened while we were all watching the cabaret show rosemary collapsed just before the lights were turned up again the doctor said that death must have been almost immediate well when you first consider it the murderer seems obvious stephen farraday was on her right her champagne glass would be close to his left hand it would be simple to drop the poison in as soon as the lights were turned down and people were watching the show those luxembourg tables are big and i dont think anybody else could have leaned across the table without being noticed even if it was dark even the man on rosemarys left would have needed to lean across her to put anything in her glass there is one other possibility but well take farraday first is there any reason why he would want to kill your wife george answered unwillingly they had been close friends if rosemary had rejected him he might have wanted revenge race looked at his red face and continued possibility number is that it was one of the women why in a party of seven with four women and three men there will be times during the evening when three couples are dancing and one woman is left sitting alone at the table did you all get up to dance yes before the cabaret can you remember who was sitting alone at any moment george thought yes iris was left out the last time and ruth the time before when did your wife last drink champagne let me see she had been dancing with browne who is rather an energetic dancer i remember her coming back quite thirsty and finishing the champagne in her glass then they played a waltz and she danced with me farraday danced with ruth and lady alexandra with browne iris stayed at the table immediately after that it was the cabaret did iris inherit any money on your wifes death my dear race dont be absurd iris was devoted to rosemary never mind she had the opportunity and i want to know if she had the motive your wife was a rich woman did her money go to you no it went to iris in trust until shes twenty one he explained paul bennetts will the rich sister and the poor sister race observed some girls might have resented that im sure iris didnt maybe not but she certainly had a motive who else did nobody rosemary didnt have an enemy in the world ive been asking questions trying to find out ive even taken this house near the farradays so as to he stopped race picked up his pipe and began to clean it out you had better tell me george what do you mean youre hiding something you can protect your wifes name or you can try to find out if she was murdered but you cant do both all right said george unhappily did your wife have a lover yes was it stephen farraday i dont know it could have been him or browne i couldnt tell tell me about anthony browne i think i have heard the name before hes a goodlooking amusing chap but nobody knows anything about him hes supposed to be american but he doesnt have much of an accent and youve no idea which of them it was no i found her writing a love letter to someone and i examined the blotting paper afterwards but there was no name well lady alexandra has a motive if her husband was having an affair with your wife and so do browne and farraday if they were having affairs they wanted to end and so does iris because of the money what about ruth lessing your secretary what sort of a girl is she shes the dearest girl in the world practically one of the family i depend upon her in every way race made no comment but mentally noted a definite motive for ruth lessing an ambition to become the second mrs barton whether she wanted her employers money or she was genuinely in love with him the dearest girl in the world had a very definite reason for wanting the removal of rosemary barton i suppose its occurred to you george he said gently that you had a rather good motive yourself george looked horrified no it wasnt like that between me and rosemary i adored her and she was very fond of me but i always knew i would have to accept her love affairs it hurt when it happened but i would never have harmed her and anyway if i had done it why would i stir things up again after a verdict of suicide was passed it would be madness absolutely i dont seriously suspect you my dear chap a successful murderer who got letters like these would just put them quietly in the fire so who does want to stir things up again who do you think wrote those letters george servants said george uncertainly if so what servants and what do they know did rosemary have her own maid no at the time we had a cook mrs pound who is still with us and a couple of maids who have both left since then well now barton think very carefully rosemary is dead you cant bring her back do you really want to know if she was murdered it may mean a lot of unpleasant publicity your wifes love affairs will be common knowledge i want the truth cried george well in that case you must take these letters to the police im not going to the police im going to set a trap for the murderer im going to have a party at the luxembourg and i want you to come race the same guests will be there the farradays browne ruth iris and myself what are you going to do george laughed thats my secret i want you to come and see what happens race spoke sharply george these dramatic gestures dont work go to the police theyre professionals so are you thats why i want you there because ive worked for the secret service race shook his head im sorry but i dont like your plan and i wont play give it up george theres a good man it wont work and it could be dangerous it will be dangerous for somebody all right race sighed oh well dont say i havent warned you chapter eleven the morning of november nd was wet and gloomy iris sat at the dining room table pushing uneaten food around her plate george read his newspaper while lucilla wept into a handkerchief victor wouldnt say it was a matter of life and death if it wasnt she wailed ive said ill see to it lucilla snapped george i know but a delay might be fatal your inquiries will take time and he says he needs the money without fail by the rd which is tomorrow dont worry aunt said iris george will fix it he always does george got up and patted mrs drake kindly on the back as he walked past her chair cheer up my dear ill get ruth to send a telegram immediately iris followed him out into the hall george shall we cancel the party tonight aunt lucilla is so upset shouldnt we stay at home with her certainly not why should that damned villain upset our lives its blackmail and lucillas a fool if victor had been forced to save himself from disaster just once it would have done him a great deal of good but ill get something arranged before tonight so that she can go to bed happy as he walked out of the front door the hall telephone rang and iris went over to answer it hello anthony she smiled in delight the man himself have you been talking to george what do you mean well he insisted i come to your birthday party tonight i thought perhaps you had something to do with it no whats the matter darling i can hear you sighing through the telephone its nothing tell me my sweet i cant ill see you tonight then i suppose george knows what hes doing but it seems madness to me they said goodbye and ended the call and iris returned to the dining room to reassure her aunt george arrived at his office and sent for ruth lessing at once trouble again ruth look he said as she arrived she took the telegram he held out victor drake yes unfortunately it is from him wasnt it a year ago that we sent him to buenos aires it was october th ruth had a good reason for remembering it was after returning from her meeting with victor drake that she had listened to rosemarys careless voice on the telephone and realized that she hated her were lucky that hes lasted as long as he has out there george observed three hundred pounds is a lot of money oh he wont get that much well make the usual investigations send ogilvie a telegram alexander ogilvie was georges business agent in buenos aires ill do it at once ruth returned to georges office after lunch with bad news im afraid that victor has been stealing money mr ogilvie has just telephoned to say that the senior partner in the firm has agreed not to prosecute victor if he repays the money the sum is one hundred and sixtyfive pounds so victor was hoping to profit by one hundred and thirty five pounds im afraid so i told mr ogilvie to go ahead and pay the money back was that right personally i would be happy to send him to prison but we must consider his mother so master victor wins as usual youre a very good man said ruth pleased and embarrassed he picked up her hand and kissed it dearest ruth what would i do without you chapter twelve george sighed with relief they were all here drinking cocktails in the luxembourg safe in his trap stephen farraday tall and stiff sandra farraday in a black velvet gown and an emerald necklace ruth also wearing black her dark hair smooth and shining iris pale and silent in a simple green dress and anthony browne the last to arrive now the play could begin they finished their drinks and charles the head waiter led them to a group of three tables in the far corner of the room there was a large one in the middle and a small one on each side a foreignlooking man and a fairhaired woman were sitting at one of the small tables another couple a young man and his girlfriend sat at the other the large table was reserved for bartons party george organized their seats sandra you sit here on my right browne next to sandra iris on my left then farraday then ruth between ruth and anthony was an empty chair the table had been laid for seven colonel race may be late he said we shouldnt wait for him iris was sure george had deliberately separated her from anthony clearly he still didnt trust him she looked across the table and saw that anthony was frowning at the empty chair beside him im glad youve got another man barton he said i may have to leave early ive seen a man here that i know george smiled mixing business with pleasure browne not that ive ever known exactly what your business is anthony replied coolly organized crime barton robberies arranged families visited at their private addresses sandra farraday laughed no youre something to do with armaments arent you anthony glanced at her in surprise you mustnt betray my secrets lady alexandra there are spies everywhere as the waiter removed their oyster plates stephen asked iris to dance soon everyone was dancing and the party became more lively at last it was iriss turn to dance with anthony its mean of george not to let us sit together she said not at all this way i can gaze at you across the table do you really have to go early im afraid so when they returned to the table there was a change in the atmosphere all the guests seemed to feel the nervous tension in the air iris saw george glance at his watch suddenly the band started to play and the cabaret show began as the restaurant lights were turned off three pairs of professional dancers entered and performed on the lighted stage in the centre of the room then a comedian did an act and after that there was a display by a pair of acrobats as the restaurant lights were switched back on at the end a wave of relief passed over the barton table as though they had been expecting something to happen which had not a year ago the lights had turned back on to show rosemary lying dead across the table now at last the shadow of tragedy had lifted cheerful conversations began all around the table only george sat staring blankly at the empty place opposite him iris nudged him come and dance with me george he shook himself and smiling raised his glass lets drink a toast to the young lady whose birthday were celebrating iris marle they raised their glasses and drank and then they got up to dance george and iris stephen and ruth anthony and sandra when the dance ended they all returned laughing and talking suddenly george leaned forward a year ago we were here on an evening that ended in tragedy i dont want to recall past sadness but i dont want to feel that rosemary is completely forgotten so ill ask you to drink to her memory he lifted his glass to rosemary they all raised their glasses and drank the toast there was a moments pause and then george fell sideways in his chair his hands at his throat fighting for breath it took him a minute and a half to die chapter thirteen iris colonel race met his old friend chief inspector kemp at scotland yard it was good of you to ring us colonel said kemp as they shook hands we need all the help we can get on this case the kidderminsters are a powerful family we mustnt upset them but what if lady alexandra or her husband murdered barton asked race chief inspector kemp looked at him steadily then well hang him or her but well have to be absolutely sure of our evidence race nodded so tell me what you know george barton died of cyanide poisoning just like his wife did a year ago you say you were actually in the restaurant yes george had invited me to the party but i refused i didnt like what he was doing trying to set a trap for the murderer so i went along to the luxembourg anyway to keep an eye on things i sat quite far away so they wouldnt see me and unfortunately i saw nothing suspicious the waiter and bartons guests were the only people at the table ive got the waiter giuseppe bolsano here for questioning but i cant believe he was involved kemp shook his head he has worked at the luxembourg for twelve years and has a very good reputation which leaves us with the guests the same people who were there when mrs barton died the two deaths must be connected somebody told mr barton that his wife had been murdered and he started to ask questions so the murderer panicked and killed him too that seems to be what happened yes agreed race well never know what georges trap at the dinner was going to be because the killer didnt wait for it to happen so weve got five suspects for this second murder then you dont think mrs bartons death was suicide after all there was some evidence for it at the time a halffinished letter to the sister with instructions on how to give away her possessions which showed suicide was in her mind and she was certainly depressed poor lady but not necessarily because she had been ill usually with women its because of a love affair you knew mrs barton was having a love affair asked race in surprise yes it had been kept quiet but it didnt take much to find it was it with stephen farraday yes they used to meet in a little flat in earls court it had been going on for over six months if they had had a fight or if he was getting tired of her well she wouldnt be the first unhappy woman to kill herself by cyanide in a public restaurant if she wanted to be dramatic about it and make him watch too did farradays wife know what was going on not as far as we know but she might have done oh yes both the farradays are possible murderers she because she was jealous he to protect his career what about the secretary ruth lessing she might have been in love with barton his staff thought so in fact yesterday afternoon one of the office telephone girls was acting out barton holding ruth lessings hand and saying he couldnt do without her miss lessing caught her doing it and dismissed her immediately so she clearly felt sensitive about it then theres the sister iris who inherited a fortune and mrs bartons other boyfriend anthony browne what do you know about him not much hes an american citizen who works in the armaments trade hes been staying at claridges hotel where he met lord dewsbury dewsbury liked him and invited browne to stay with him and showed him round his factories soon after brownes visit they found that some tanks had been sabotaged browne also made friends with dewsburys business partners who showed him a lot of classified things he should never have seen several times theres been serious trouble at the factories soon after he left but why would mrs barton be a threat to him george barton wasnt connected to the armament world was he no but they were close friends and he might have told her something important you of all men know what a pretty woman can learn from a man colonel race nodded knowing the chief inspector was referring to his work for the secret service and not to his private affairs have you examined the letters that george barton received yes miss marle gave them to me yesterday cheap paper ordinary ink no unexplained fingerprints and written by someone who had suspicions but told george instead of the police he couldnt have written them himself could he kemp to make his own suicide look like murder and so send stephen farraday to the hangmans rope he would have needed to be certain that everything pointed to farraday as the murderer then but we havent got any evidence against farraday at all cyanide was found in a small paper sachet under the table that night but there were no fingerprints on it did anybody notice anything helpful last night i took a brief statement from everyone last night and then i went back to elvaston square with miss marle and had a look through bartons desk i will get more detailed statements from them today and also from the people sitting at the tables on both sides he picked up a list gerald tollington of the grenadier guards and the honorable patricia bricewoodworth ill bet that young couple didnt see anything but each other and pedro morales hes a rather unpleasant mexican businessman and his guest miss christine shannon its unlikely that any of them saw anything but well have to check chapter fourteen giuseppe bolsano was a small middleaged man with an intelligent face his english was fluent since he had he explained nervously been in the country since he was sixteen and had married an english wife now then giuseppe said kemp what else can you tell us about last night what kind of champagne did they drink clicquot said the little italian waiter a very expensive wine mr barton liked the best and the empty place at the table mr barton told me that a young lady would occupy it later in the evening a young lady do you know who she was giuseppe shook his head how many bottles of champagne did mr barton order two they finished the first one quite quickly and i opened the second just before the cabaret began i filled up the glasses and put the bottle in the ice bucket when did you last notice mr barton drinking from his glass when the cabaret ended they drank a toast to the young lady then they all went to dance when they returned to the table mr barton drank again and in a minute like that he was dead did you fill up the glasses while they were dancing no signore there was still plenty left did anyone come near the table whilst they were dancing no and they all returned from the dance floor at the same time giuseppe tried to remember mr barton came back first with the young lady he did not want to dance for so long then came mr farraday and the young lady in black lady alexandra and the dark gentleman came last if one of them had put something in mr bartons glass would you have seen i cannot say sir i was serving all three tables in that corner and two more in another part of the restaurant after the cabaret when everyone went to dance i was just standing and watching so i know that no one approached the table then but when they sat down again i was at once very busy but it would be very difficult to do it without being observed i think only mr barton himself could do it is that what you think said kemp a year ago the beautiful mrs barton killed herself perhaps mr barton was so unhappy that he decided to kill himself the same way kemp shook his head i dont think its that simple giuseppe was allowed to leave and as the door closed behind him race said i wonder if thats what were meant to think grieving husband kills himself on the anniversary of wifes death not that it was the anniversary but near enough it was all souls day the day we remember the dead true well possibly that was the idea if so the murderer cant have known about the letters that mr barton had shown to you and iris marle kemp looked at his watch im going to kidderminster house at but theres time to go and see the people at the other two tables first would you come with me colonel chapter fifteen mr morales was staying at the ritz he was not a pretty sight his chin was unshaven his eyes were red and he had every sign of heavy drinking the night before he said he was happy to help chief inspector kemp and colonel race if he could but he couldnt remember much about last night they asked what he could remember about the large table next to his own i dont remember much about the people sitting there at least not until that guy dropped dead i do remember one of the ladies though dark hair black dress great figure it was ruth lessing who had caught mr morales attention and oh boy she could really dance mr morales admitted that he had been quite drunk by the time the cabaret began and it was clear that he had no useful information to offer them so kemp thanked him and turned to leave the room im sailing to new york tomorrow said morales do you need me here im enjoying myself and if the police wanted me to stay in london my boss wont complain thank you but i dont think your evidence will be needed at the inquest kemp and race next went to call on the honourable patricia bricewoodworth in brook street its maddening said patricia when they explained the reason for their visit probably the only chance in my life to be right there when a murder was done and i wasnt even looking as the chief inspector had guessed patricia and her fiance gerald had only been interested in each other and youll find he said angrily as they left the house that gerald tollingtons story will be the same oh well lets try morales dinner guest christine shannon then well have finished with the extra witnesses christine shannon was extremely good to look at and although she wasnt very intelligent she had a lot of common sense and a talent for getting money from the men she attracted she welcomed the two men into her small flat with real delight id love to help you chief inspector please ask me anything you like kemp questioned her about the people at the large table and she proved to be surprisingly observant things werent going well the man who was holding the party was trying so hard but it was no good the tall blonde woman on his right was as stiff as a pole and the girl in the green dress on his left was desperate to sit next to the handsome dark man opposite the fair man next to her looked ill and the blackhaired woman next to him looked really nervous you seem to have noticed a great deal miss shannon said colonel race well actually i wasnt having a very good time myself i had gone out with this mexican guy three nights in a row and i was getting tired of him he wanted to experience london night life so we dined at the compradour and the mille fleurs and then last night it was the luxembourg champagne all the way but his conversation was so boring just business deals he had done in mexico and all the women who were crazy about him i got tired of listening after a while so i just ate my supper and looked round the room well lets hope you saw something that may help us said kemp christine shook her head ive no idea who killed the man he just took a drink of champagne went purple in the face and collapsed do you remember when he had last drunk from his glass before that she thought hard why yes after the cabaret the lights went up he picked up his glass and said something and the others picked up their glasses too they drank a toast of some kind then the music started and they all went off to dance laughing for the first time champagne can do that for the dullest parties they left the table empty yes and no one came near the table while they were away no one except the waiter which waiter one of the junior ones not the italian and did this junior fill up the glasses christine shook her head he just picked up an evening bag that one of the girls had dropped when they got up to dance put it back on the table and went off again whose bag was it she concentrated it was green and gold so it belonged to the girl in the green dress the other two had black bags could someone else have gone to the table without you noticing christine shook her head no you see pedro had gone to make a telephone call so i was just looking around and there wasnt much to see from where i was sitting except the empty table next to us well when they all came back to sit down the man who died said something and they all picked up their glasses again and then it happened she paused i thought it was a stroke pedro came back just then and i said look pedro that mans had a stroke and he said hes passing out thats all which was pretty much what pedro was doing himself i had to keep my eye on him they dont like you passing out at the luxembourg that girls an excellent witness kemp said as they left miss shannons flat if there had been anything to see she would have seen it its a conjuring trick george barton drinks champagne goes off to dance comes back drinks from the same glass and suddenly its full of cyanide its crazy he paused that young waiter was the only person who was near the table while they were all away dancing if he had put anything in bartons glass christine would have seen him race remarked im beginning to believe he did it himself but if so im sure he didnt know it was cyanide you mean someone gave it to him told him it was medicine of some kind possibly who the farradays asked kemp thats unlikely and anthony browne is equally unlikely which leaves the loving sisterinlaw and the loyal secretary yes she could have given him something like that kemp looked at race im going to kidderminster house now what about you ill go and see miss lessing said race ill offer my sympathy maybe take her out to lunch so you think its her then i dont think anything yet chapter sixteen chief inspector kemp arrived at kidderminster house and the butler led him to the library where lord kidderminster and the farradays were waiting lord kidderminster shook his hand chief inspector we appreciate your kindness in coming here instead of summoning my daughter and her husband to scotland yard this is the second time that they have witnessed a violent death in the same restaurant involving two members of the same family publicity of this kind can damage the reputation of a man in public life the commissioner of police tells me that bartons death is murder not suicide but you thought it was suicide didnt you sandra my dear it seemed so obvious she said thoughtfully we were at the same table where poor rosemary poisoned herself last year when we saw george barton down in sussex during the summer his behaviour was very strange we thought he hadnt recovered from his wifes death so yes suicide seemed possible and i cant imagine why anyone would want to murder him nor can i said stephen barton was an excellent fellow i dont think he had an enemy in the world chief inspector kemp paused for a moment before replying what you say is quite correct im sure but before his death george barton told two people that he believed his wife had been poisoned by someone else the party last night in honour of miss marles birthday was actually supposed to reveal the identity of rosemary bartons killer so he was certainly not considering suicide kemps manner became slightly more official lady alexandra you said that mr bartons behaviour had been strange this summer in what way well he was nervous he couldnt concentrate on what was said to him yes agreed stephen he looked ill too he had lost weight did you notice any change in his attitude towards you and your husband was he less friendly perhaps no quite the opposite in fact he bought a country house near to ours was rosemary barton a close friend of yours lady alexandra no we were not close she gave a light laugh she was really stephens friend she was interested in politics and he enjoyed educating such a charming and attractive woman and youre a very clever one thought kemp i wonder how much you really know about those two he continued aloud what do you know about anthony browne lady alexandra nothing at all but i have met him occasionally kemp turned to stephen mr farraday i probably know less than my wife does she has danced with him at least he seems to be a pleasant chap was he particularly close to mrs barton stephen frowned they were friendly thats all i can say and what can you tell me about miss lessing lady alexandra she was mr bartons secretary ive only met her twice first on the evening that mrs barton died and again last night did you form the impression that she was in love with george barton i have no idea then let us talk about the events of last night the farradays evidence confirmed the important points about the tragic events barton had proposed a toast to iris they had drunk it and then got up to dance george and iris had returned first when asked about the empty chair they said that george was expecting a man called colonel race to join them later in the evening when the lights were turned on again after the cabaret george had stared at the empty chair with a strange expression on his face before proposing a toast to iriss birthday closing his notebook kemp rose to his feet im grateful for your help he turned to stephen mr farraday there are one or two other points where i think you could help me perhaps you could visit me at scotland yard at a time that suits you i know youre a busy man the request was pleasant but the message was serious somehow stephen managed a friendly smile certainly chief inspector chapter seventeen ruth welcomed colonel race into her office with calm friendliness she was smartly dressed as always but he noticed the dark circles under her eyes and the sadness round her mouth im glad youve come colonel mr barton was expecting you to join us last night i was surprised that he hadnt invited another woman to make an even number of guests she broke off what do such details matter now i feel so stunned this morning but you have still come into the office of course she looked shocked there is so much to arrange george told me how much he relied upon you said race she swallowed hard and then said quietly i was with him for nearly eight years and i think he trusted me im sure of that race went on it is nearly lunchtime would you come and have lunch with me i have a lot that i would like to say to you thank you i would like that very much race took ruth to a quiet little restaurant and they made polite general conversation while they waited for their food when the waiter had served them and left she said do you want to talk about last night i would like to talk about it please if i hadnt seen it happen i wouldnt have believed it was it really murder colonel race did kemp tell you that last night not exactly but it was clear what he was thinking miss lessing you were with george for most of yesterday did he seem at all upset or excited she hesitated its difficult to say he was upset but there was a reason for that she told race about victor drake and his most recent demand for money hmm said race and barton was upset about it he was annoyed certainly and he wanted to fix it quickly its happened before several times you see in fact last year victor got into such trouble in this country that we had to send him to south america but it seemed to me that he was actually angry because victors telegram arrived just as he was preparing his party at the luxembourg and he didnt want to think about anything else did george tell you the real reason why he was having this party she shook her head he didnt tell you that he believed his wife had been murdered she stared at him george believed that yes he received two anonymous letters saying that his wife had been killed by someone else so thats why he was so strange this summer and i knew nothing about it ruth sounded upset i see now that he must have had a plan in his head maybe he hoped that by recreating rosemarys party he would find a clue of some kind and thats why he didnt tell me about the letters because if it was a murder then one of us round the table must have killed her it might even have been me race said gently did you have any reason for killing rosemary barton she looked down at the table and sighed i think you had better know then she met his eyes i was in love with george i was in love with him before he even met rosemary and i would have made him a good wife i could have made him happy he loved rosemary but he wasnt happy with her did you dislike rosemary yes i was shocked when she died but i wasnt sorry i was glad she paused please can we talk about something else id like you to tell me then everything you can remember about yesterday ruth recalled georges anger over victors new demand for money and the arrangements they made through their south american agent then she described arriving at the luxembourg and continued her story up to the tragic moment her report confirmed the other accounts race had already heard ruth frowned if it was murder it couldnt have been done by any of us so who did put the poison into georges glass while we were dancing the evidence shows that no one else went near the table then it doesnt make sense do you have any idea who might have put the cyanide in the glass was there anything at all suspicious last night however small for a moment she looked uncertain then she answered nothing but there had been something he was sure of that after lunch ruth returned to the office and race drove to elvaston square was it possible that ruth lessing was guilty he wondered she seemed honest and straightforward but she certainly had a motive at least for the first murder with rosemary gone she had a good chance of becoming mrs george barton race thought that ruth was too sensible to kill for money but love perhaps loving george and hating rosemary she might well have coldly planned and executed rosemarys death the fact that a verdict of suicide had been passed could be just another example of her famous efficiency but then george had received the anonymous letters and planned his trap and so ruth had silenced him no that didnt feel right that suggested panic and ruth lessing was not the type of woman who panicked she was more intelligent than george and could easily avoid any trap that he might try to set so it seemed that ruth didnt fit after all chapter eighteen lucilla drake came into the sitting room dressed in black and held out a shaking hand to colonel race she couldnt have seen anyone she explained except such an old friend of dear georges it was dreadful to have no man in the house she had no idea what to do of course miss lessing would manage all the business matters and they must arrange the funeral but what about the inquest race said that she could depend on him for help lucilla was very grateful miss lessing was very efficient of course but perhaps george had relied upon her too much of course lucilla had known what the girl was planning unlike dear iris who was such an innocent and so quiet it was impossible to know what she was thinking about in fact lucilla had wanted iris to see the doctor this summer because she looked so pale and tired but really colonel i believe that was due to the location of the house it was in a deep valley you know and there was always a damp mist around it in the evenings poor george had bought it himself such a pity it would have been better if he had taken an older womans advice men knew nothing about houses she would have been happy to help she had no other demands on her time after all with her husband dead for many years now and her dear victor away in brazil colonel race said he had heard that she had a son abroad and with that single encouragement lucilla told him all about her beloved victor he was such a handsome clever boy willing to try his hand at anything just look at all the different jobs he had done and never unkind or badtempered but hes always been unlucky colonel he was wrongly accused of a crime by the headmaster of his school and then the authorities at oxford university were so unfair of course an artistic boy would think it an excellent joke to copy someone elses handwriting he did it for fun not for money eventually colonel race managed to move lucilla on from the subject of her son to that of servants it was very difficult to find good servants these days she agreed they were lucky mrs pound was an excellent cook who had worked for them ever since george married she had been happy to move to the country for the summer unlike the parlourmaid who had resigned but that was for the best she had no manners and had also broken six of the best wineglasses i mentioned it in her reference for it is important to be truthful colonel race and faults must be noted as well as good qualities but the girl was quite rude and said that she hoped next time at least she wouldnt be working in the kind of house where people got murdered which was quite inaccurate since poor rosemary took her own life and so i wrote in her reference that the parlourmaid betty archdale was sober and honest but that she broke things and was not always polite to her employer if i had been mrs rees talbot i would not have employed her with such a reference but people nowadays will take whatever they can get colonel race asked if she meant the mrs reestalbot whose family he had known in india i couldnt say cadogan square was the address those are my friends lucilla said that there were no friends like old friends friendship was a wonderful thing wasnt it she had always thought it was so romantic about viola and paul for example dear viola had been a lovely girl with so many men in love with her but of course colonel race wouldnt know who she was talking about the colonel asked to know the story she happily told him about her brother hectors marriage to the beautiful viola and how paul bennett had changed from lover into family friend and godfather to rosemary to whom he had left his fortune on his death and now dear iris has inherited the money and although i try to look out for fortunehunters one cant protect girls these days as one used to do iris has friends i know nothing about poor george was particularly worried about a man called browne and i always think that men are the best judges of other men a faint sound made race look round to see iris marle in the open doorway iris dear cried lucilla do you remember colonel race iris came in and shook hands race had met her once before on his recent visit to little priors her black dress made her look thinner and paler than he remembered she was clearly still suffering from shock i came to see if i could be of any help to you said race thank you that was kind she turned to her aunt were you talking about anthony just now lucilla blushed well yes as a matter of fact i did just mention that we know nothing about him iris interrupted her youll have every chance of doing so in future because im going to marry him oh iris lucilla cried you mustnt do anything foolish nothing can be decided at present one cant talk about things like marriage when the funeral hasnt even taken place it isnt fitting the question simply doesnt arise iris laughed suddenly but it has arisen anthony asked me to marry him before we left little priors he wanted me to come up to london and marry him the next day without telling anyone i wish now that i had wasnt that a rather strange request said colonel race gently no it wasnt and it would have saved a lot of trouble he asked me to trust him and i didnt but now ill marry him as soon as he likes lucilla burst into tears miss marle might i speak to you privately before i leave asked race on a matter of business why yes she said surprised and walked to the door race followed her across the hall into a small room at the back of the house all i wanted to say miss marle he said was that chief inspector kemp is a friend of mine and im sure you will find him both helpful and kind she stared at him for a moment why didnt you come and join us last night as george expected you to george didnt expect me he said he did he may have said so but he knew i wasnt coming but that empty chair who was it for then her face went white rosemary she whispered i see it was for rosemary he thought she was going to faint he caught hold of her and helped her to sit down im all right she said breathlessly but i dont know what to do can i help she looked up at him unhappily i must get things in order george believed rosemary was murdered because of those letters colonel race who wrote those letters nobody knows but george believed them and arranged the party last night there was an empty chair and it was all souls day the day of the dead a day when rosemarys spirit could come back and and tell him the truth you mustnt be too imaginative but george drank a toast to rosemary and then he died perhaps she came and took him the dead dont put cyanide in a champagne glass my dear his words seemed to steady her and she said in a more normal tone of voice but its incredible the police think george was murdered and i suppose it must be true but it doesnt make sense no if rosemary was murdered and george was beginning to suspect who but she wasnt she had a reason for her suicide ill show you she left the room and returned with rosemarys letter in her hand which she handed to him read for yourself race unfolded the paper and read it through you see she said she was brokenhearted she didnt want to go on living do you know who that letter was written to iris nodded stephen farraday she was in love with him and he was cruel to her so she took the cyanide to the restaurant and drank it there where he could see her die perhaps she hoped he would be sorry then when did you find this about six months ago you didnt show it to george how could i betray my sister she cried passionately and george was so sure that she loved him i couldnt tell him he was wrong what do i do now ive shown the letter to you because you were georges friend does inspector kemp need to see it yes its evidence you see you should let me take it to him now she gave a deep sigh very well chapter nineteen mary reestalbot greeted colonel race with a cry of delight my dear i havent seen you since you disappeared so mysteriously from allahabad that time why are you here you never make social visits come on tell me the truth race smiled is betty archdale the maid who let me in dont tell me shes a dangerous european spy no no shes just a parlourmaid but i think she may be able to tell me something im sure youre right shes the kind of servant who always manages to be passing by when theres anything interesting going on what do you want me to do offer me a drink then call for betty and order it and when betty brings it then please go away oh all right then ill play mrs reestalbot rang the bell for betty and asked her to bring colonel race a whisky and soda when betty returned with the drink on a tray mrs reestalbot was standing by the door colonel race has some questions to ask you she said and went out betty looked at the tall greyhaired soldier with alarm he took the glass from the tray and smiled have you seen the papers today he asked yes sir she said cautiously did you read that mr george barton died last night at the luxembourg restaurant oh yes sir bettys eyes sparkled with pleasure at the chance to discuss the public scandal wasnt it dreadful you were in service with the bartons werent you yes sir i left soon after mrs barton died was mr barton murdered too the papers didnt say exactly why do you say too betty mrs bartons death was judged to be a suicide she glanced at him doubtfully yes sir didnt you think it was no sir not really why not well betty hesitated it was something i heard one day yes he encouraged her well i would never go and listen at a door or anything but i was going through the hall carrying a tray and the parlour door wasnt shut and mrs barton and mr browne were speaking quite loudly she said something about anthony browne not being his name and mr browne threatened to cut her face then he said if she didnt do what he told her he would murder her i didnt hear any more because miss iris was coming down the stairs i didnt think much of it at the time but after mrs barton committed suicide at that party and i heard mr browne had been there at the time well it scared me but you didnt say anything she shook her head i didnt want to get mixed up with the police and perhaps if i had said anything i would have been murdered too and anyway it might have been a joke mr browne was always joking so i couldnt tell sir could i race agreed that she couldnt mrs barton said browne wasnt his real name did she mention his real name yes and he said forget about tony tony something reminded me of the cherry jam that cook had been making tony cheriton cherable she shook her head again it began with an m it sounded foreign well if you remember write to me at the address on this card race handed betty his business card and a pound note i will sir thank you sir as she left the room mary reestalbot returned well was it successful yes theres just one problem maybe you can help me can you think of a name that would remind you of cherry jam what an extraordinary question please mary well we dont often make cherry jam its much too sweet unless you use cooking cherries morello cherries thats it race exclaimed mary im very grateful could you ring that bell again so that betty comes to show me out arent you going to tell me what its all about she asked indignantly i promise to come back and tell you the whole story he called as he left the room betty was waiting in the hall with his hat and coat he thanked her and walked out of the front door at the top of the steps he paused by the way betty he said was the name morelli betty smiled quite right sir tony morelli chapter twenty at scotland yard chief inspector kemp was interviewing pierre one of six junior waiters at the luxembourg and having to accept that pierre had done no more than pick up a ladys bag from the floor and put it back beside her plate i am hurrying past with a sauce when the young lady knocks her bag from the table as she goes to dance so i pick it up and put it back and then i hurry on that is all monsieur kemp dismissed him and was sitting at his desk disappointed when sergeant pollock arrived to report that a miss chloe west was asking for the officer in charge of the luxembourg case very well bring her in said kemp chloe west was twentyfive tall brownhaired and very pretty she looked familiar to kemp although he was sure that he had never met her before what can i do for you miss west he asked i read in the paper about the man who died at the luxembourg george barton did you know him not exactly can i have your full name and address please chloe elizabeth west merryvale court maida vale im an actress yes well when i read that the police were inquiring into mr bartons death i thought i should come and tell you something it may not be anything to do with it but ill be the judge of that said kemp pleasantly go on well mr barton saw my photograph in spotlight which is the actors professional directory he contacted me and said he had a job for me he was having a dinner party at the luxembourg and he wanted to surprise his guests i met him and he showed me a photograph and told me that he wanted me to dress up as the person in the picture i looked very similar he said of course that was why she was familiar chloe west looked like the photograph of rosemary that kemp had seen on the desk in georges study he gave me the dress he wanted me to wear its a greyish green silk he asked me to change my hair to the colour in the photograph and copy the makeup then i was supposed to come into the luxembourg restaurant during the cabaret show and sit down in the empty seat at mr bartons table why didnt you keep the appointment miss west because at about eight oclock that night someone telephoned me to say that the party had been cancelled then the next morning i read about the death in the papers and very sensibly you came along to us said kemp thank you very much miss west youve explained the mystery of the empty chair by the way was the person who telephoned you a man im not sure i think so but it sounded as though he had a cold when chloe west had gone kemp said to sergeant pollock so that was george bartons plan and thats why he sat looking at that empty chair after the cabaret his clever plan had gone wrong you dont think it was him who cancelled the job no in fact it may not have been a man at all a cold can change your voice were making progress at last chapter twenty one stephen farraday arrived at scotland yard later that same day feeling very nervous why had chieflnspector kemp asked him for this extra interview what did he suspect kemp greeted him pleasantly enough and invited him to sit down stephen noticed a police officer sitting at a table in the corner of the room with a pencil and a notebook i wish to take a statement from you mr farraday that statement will be written down and you will be asked to read it and sign it before you leave however it is my duty to tell you that you may refuse to make such a statement and that you are also allowed to have a lawyer present if you wish that sounds very serious chief inspector but why do you need another statement from me you heard all i had to say this morning there are certain facts mr farraday which i thought you would prefer to discuss here anything that is not relevant to a case we try to keep confidential im sure you understand what i am referring to im afraid not kemp sighed you had a close relationship with the late mrs rosemary barton who says so stephen interrupted kemp picked up a letter from his desk this letter was found amongst the late mrs bartons belongings it was handed to us by miss iris marle who confirms it is her sisters handwriting stephen read the letter and a wave of sickness passed over him he could hear rosemarys voice begging him would the past never die he looked up at kemp there is no proof that this letter was written to me do you pay the rent for malland mansions earls court so they had found the flat he had rented where he and rosemary used to meet they knew everything stephen shrugged his shoulders may i ask why my private affairs should be of interest to you they are not unless they are connected to the death of george barton so you are suggesting that i had an affair with his wife and then murdered him mr farraday lets be honest you and mrs barton were very close friends you ended the relationship not the lady she intended to make trouble and then very conveniently she died she committed suicide george barton didnt think so he started to ask questions and then he died there is a pattern to it why are you accusing me mrs bartons death was lucky for you wasnt it a scandal would have ruined your political career did your wife know about the affair mr farraday certainly not and i hope she will never learn about it now is your wife a jealous woman no she is much too sensible do you keep a supply of cyanide at your country house mr farraday i believe the gardener may have some but you have never purchased any yourself i have never purchased cyanide kemp asked farraday a few more questions then let him go he was very quick to deny that his wife knew about his affair he said thoughtfully to his colleague you would think he would realize that if his wife didnt know about the affair that gave him an extra motive for silencing rosemary barton the clever story would be to say that his wife knew about the affair and had accepted it at that moment the telephone rang it was colonel race calling from a public telephone box their conversation was short but satisfactory ill send a telegram to america at once kemp concluded we should hear back almost immediately it will be a great relief if you are right i think i am said colonel race chapter twenty two anthony browne frowned at the card the hotel porter was holding out to him then he shrugged his shoulders all right show him up he was standing at his window when the tall military looking man came in a man he knew a great deal about colonel race he said pleasantly you were a friend of george bartons i know he offered him a chair a cigarette thank you anthony lit a match for him you were the guest who didnt arrive that night lucky for you youre wrong that empty chair wasnt for me anthony was surprised really barton said he may have said so but his plan was quite different that chair was meant to be occupied while the lights were off by an actress called chloe west a young actress who looks like rosemary barton anthony whistled i see she had been given a photograph of rosemary and asked to copy her appearance she even had the dress which rosemary wore the night she died race continued then the lights go on and as people gasp in fear and horror they see rosemary back from the dead and the guilty person cries out i did it browne did not believe it what a terrible idea a real killer isnt going to behave like a silly schoolgirl if somebody poisoned rosemary barton and was about to do the same to george they had a lot of confidence and it would take more than an actress in fancy dress to make them confess ah but remember that in shakespeares play macbeth panicked when he saw the ghost of banquo he had killed so how about that mr tony morelli there was a silence anthony sat down and threw his cigarette into the fire how did you find out you admit that you are tony morelli why deny it i expect youve got my details from america and you admit that when rosemary barton discovered your real identity you threatened to murder her unless she kept quiet i tried to scare her agreed tony pleasantly colonel race stared uncertainly at the man sitting opposite him shall i tell you exactly what we know about you morelli it might be amusing you were convicted in the united states of trying to sabotage the ericsen aeroplane works and were sent to prison at the end of your sentence you vanished you were next discovered in london staying at claridges and calling yourself anthony browne there you met lord dewsbury and other important armaments manufacturers you stayed with lord dewsbury and he chose to share some topsecret information with you it is a strange coincidence morelli that a trail of mysterious accidents and some lucky escapes from industrial disasters occurred soon after your visits to various important armaments factories coincidences said anthony are extraordinary things you returned to london and befriended iris marle making excuses not to visit her home so that her family would not realize how close you were becoming finally you tried to persuade her to marry you in secret and why not ive served my prison sentence ive made some useful friends ive fallen in love with a charming girl and im keen to marry her so keen that you wanted the wedding to happen before her family could discover your background iris marle is a very rich young woman anthony nodded families can be horribly interfering iris doesnt know anything about my criminal past and i would rather she didnt im afraid she is going to learn all about it perhaps you dont realize anthony laughed oh i know what youre thinking rosemary barton found out about me so i killed her george suspected me so i killed him and now im after iriss money it all makes sense but you cant prove a thing race watched him carefully for some minutes then he got up from his chair all the facts about your past are true he said and its all wrong anthony narrowed his eyes whats wrong you are the story made sense until i saw you but now it wont work youre not a criminal youre one of us arent you a british agent anthony smiled slowly yes thats why ive tried to avoid meeting you i was afraid that you would guess what i am and it was important that nobody knew until yesterday now thank goodness its all over weve caught the gang of international criminals weve been hunting for the last three years ive been working undercover going to meetings making connections inside the gang at last my chief decided that i had to commit a real crime and go to prison it was the most certain way to convince the gang i was one of them when i came out of prison they trusted me and i gradually worked my way towards the centre of the operation it was an international network run from central europe acting as the gangs agent i came to london and stayed at claridges hotel they had ordered me to make friends with lord dewsbury so i joined the london social scene and thats how i met rosemary barton but one day i was shocked to learn that she knew i had been in prison in america as tony morelli i was terrified for her safety the criminals i was working for would have killed her immediately if they thought she knew about me i tried to scare her into keeping her mouth shut but i couldnt trust her to keep quiet so i decided to leave london and then i saw iris coming down a staircase i promised myself that once my mission was finished i would come back and marry her when my part in the operation was over i returned to london and found her again i stayed away from her family because i knew they would make inquiries about my background and i needed to stay undercover for a bit longer but i began to worry about her she looked ill and afraid and george barton was behaving very strangely i asked her to come away and marry me but she refused and then i was invited to this party as we sat down to dinner george said you would be coming so i told him that i had met a man i knew and might have to leave early actually i had seen someone i knew in america monkey coleman and i wanted to avoid him but i really wanted to escape meeting you as i was still undercover and then george died i had nothing to do with his death or rosemarys i still dont know who did kill them any idea it must have been either the waiter or one of the people at the table i dont think it was the waiter it wasnt me or iris it could have been one or both of the farradays ruth lessing seems to me to be the most likely person but on both nights she was sitting in a place from which it was impossible for her to poison the champagne glass anthony paused have you found out who wrote those anonymous letters yet race shook his head no i thought i had but i was wrong because someone knows that rosemary was murdered and unless youre careful that person will be murdered next chapter twenty three on the day of the inquest into georges death anthony arrived at elvaston square at halfpast five in the afternoon he was told by the new parlourmaid that iris had just come in and was in the study iris jumped nervously as he entered the room oh its you she said anthony came quickly towards her whats the matter darling nothing she paused only i was nearly run over oh it was my own fault i was thinking so hard i crossed the road without looking and a car came round a corner really fast and just missed me anthony held her gently oh iris im worried about you not about your miraculous escape from under the wheels of a car but about why youre wandering about in the middle of the road whats worrying you my darling im afraid she said quietly anthony sat down beside her on a sofa come on he smiled encouragingly tell me all about it i dont know if youll believe me its about the other night you were at the inquest this morning so you heard she broke off her eyes wide and dark with fear very little said anthony the police doctor talked about the effects of cyanide the police inspector who was the first to arrive at the luxembourg gave his report georges body was identified by his chief clerk and then the inquest was closed for a week that police inspector described finding a small paper sachet under the table containing signs of cyanide yes well clearly whoever put the poison into georges glass then dropped the container under the table couldnt risk having it found on him or her iris began to shake no anthony i dropped that packet under the table he stared at her in amazement you remember how george drank that champagne and then it happened she said he nodded it was like some horrible dream after the cabaret when the lights went on again i was so happy because that was the moment when we found rosemary dead before and i was so afraid that i would see it all again see her lying dead across the table but there was nothing there and suddenly it felt as if the whole thing really was over at last and everything would be all right again so i danced with george and started to enjoy myself at last then we came back to the table and george asked us to drink to rosemarys memory and then he died and the nightmare was back again i just stood there shaking and suddenly i started to cry i opened my bag to get my handkerchief and i found something tangled up inside it it was a paper sachet the kind you get medicine powders in from the chemist but it wasnt in my bag when i left home i had packed a powder compact a lipstick a handkerchief a comb and some loose coins so someone else must have put that sachet in my bag and i remembered how they had found a sachet like that in rosemarys bag after she died with cyanide in it so i dropped it under the table i was really frightened somebody meant it to look as though i killed george and i didnt anthony whistled did anyone see you do it iris hesitated i think ruth may have but she was so shocked that i dont know if she actually noticed or if she was just staring at me blankly why werent your fingerprints on it i wonder i was holding it through the handkerchief anthony nodded that was lucky but who could have put it in my bag i had it beside me all the evening no when you went to dance after the cabaret you left it on the table somebody could have done it then or when you visited the ladies cloakroom as you arrived can you remember what happened in there iris thought we all went to the long table put our bags down and checked our makeup in the mirrors ruth put powder on her nose and sandra tidied up her hair i gave my coat to the attendant and went over to the washbasins leaving your bag on the table yes i washed my hands while ruth finished her makeup and sandra gave her coat to the attendant then sandra returned to the mirror ruth came over to wash her hands and i went back to the table to comb my hair so either of them could have put something in your bag without you seeing yes but i cant believe they would do such a thing and if it was ruth why didnt she say she saw me drop the packet i dont know so it looks as though it wasnt her iris sighed im so glad ive told you no one else needs to know do they anthony looked embarrassed im afraid they do iris in fact youre going to come with me now in a taxi to tell kemp oh no anthony theyll think i killed george theyre more likely to think so if they find out later that you kept quiet about this please anthony look here iris youre in a difficult position but you must tell the truth you cant play safe when its a question of justice come on were going to see kemp now as she followed him unwillingly into the hall the front door bell rang oh i forgot exclaimed iris ruth said she would come over after work to discuss the funeral arrangements aunt lucilla has gone to have tea with a friend and i thought we could organize things better while she was out she does confuse things so anthony stepped forward and opened the door ruth was looking tired and carrying a large briefcase im sorry im late the train was terribly crowded tonight and then i had to wait for three buses there wasnt a taxi anywhere iris said i cant come now anthony you must said anthony im sorry to take iris away miss lessing but it cant be avoided thats all right mr browne ill fix everything with mrs drake when she comes back come on said anthony and pulled iris out through the open door a taxi was approaching along the square anthony stopped it and asked the driver to take them to scotland yard chapter twenty four an hour or two later three men were sitting at a small round table in a cafe colonel race and chief inspector kemp were drinking cups of dark brown tea anthony was drinking the cafes idea of a nice cup of coffee it was certainly not anthonys idea chief inspector kemp having checked into anthonys real background carefully had decided to accept him as a colleague if you ask me he said dropping several lumps of sugar into his tea and stirring it this case will never come to trial our only hope was to find evidence of the purchasing or handling of cyanide by one of those five suspects but we havent itll be one of those cases where you know who did it but simply cant prove it do you know who did it asked anthony oh im pretty certain it was lady alexandra farraday i believe shes the jealous type i doubt mr barton would have bought that house in the country unless he suspected one of the farradays he must have made it pretty obvious insisting that they come to his party so she decided to finish him off thats just theory but the fact is that the only person who could have dropped something into mr bartons glass just before he drank would be lady alexandra who was sitting on his right just one point interrupted race even if lady alexandra is a jealous woman capable of murder could she slip incriminating evidence into an innocent girls handbag a girl who has never done her any harm could the daughter of the kidderminsters do such a thing inspector kemp stared unhappily into his teacup for a moment then decided to change the subject mr browne he said turning to anthony and ill still call you that if you dont mind i want to thank you for bringing miss marle straight to me this evening to tell her story she didnt want to come i imagine said colonel race shes terrified poor girl said anthony naturally said the chief inspector but i think we reassured her she went home quite happy you may be right chief inspector that the case will never come to trial but thats a very unsatisfactory ending and we still dont know who wrote those letters to george are your suspicions still the same browne asked race yes ruth lessing is my bet for the murderer she was in love with george and i believe rosemary treated her pretty badly i think she saw a chance to get rid of rosemary and then marry george herself ruth lessing has the cool character that could plan and execute a murder and she certainly has the motive for the first killing agreed race but why would she then poison the man she loved and wanted to marry and if she had hidden the cyanide packet in iriss bag why did she keep quiet about seeing her throw it under the table perhaps she didnt see it suggested anthony doubtfully i think she did when i interviewed her i knew she was hiding something so who gets your vote colonel asked kemp race looked at the other men thoughtfully you have both chosen female suspects and i also suspect a woman he paused i think the guilty person is iris marle anthony pushed his chair back with a crash his face red with anger with an effort he regained his selfcontrol and although his voice shook slightly it sounded as light and mocking as ever by all means let us discuss the idea why iris and if so why should she tell me about dropping the cyanide paper under the table because she knew that ruth had seen her do it anthony nodded very well so why do you suspect her the motive said race rosemary inherited an enormous fortune in which iris had no share but if rosemary died childless the money would be hers rosemary was depressed exhausted by her illness in just the mood where a verdict of suicide would be accepted and then george showed her those anonymous letters and she panicked and murdered him too is that what you think yes so how did she get the cyanide into georges glass i dont know well im glad theres something you dont know anthonys eyes were dangerous right then he continued briskly things have changed and we simply have to solve this case now ill restate the questions who knew that rosemary had been murdered and who wrote to george telling him so well im afraid well have to ignore that first murder for now its too long ago and we dont know exactly what happened but i saw the second murder take place so i should know how it happened the perfect time to put the cyanide in georges glass was during the cabaret but it couldnt have been done then because he drank from the glass straight afterwards nobody else touched his glass but the next time he drank from it it was full of cyanide he couldnt have been poisoned but he was it was a conjuring trick oh of course he held his head in his hands in obvious mental distress thats it thats it for lots and lots of money and maybe love as well the bag the waiter yes he dropped his hands and stared at the other two men dont you see a waiter could have poisoned the champagne but not the waiter who was serving them and george and georges glass are two different things come on ill show you he jumped to his feet kemp looked regretfully at his halffull teacup i have to pay the bill he muttered no no well be back in a moment i must show you outside come on pushing their chairs out of the way he hurried the others into the entrance hall of the cafe do you see that telephone box over there yes anthony felt in his pockets oh no i havent got a coin for the call never mind id rather not do that actually lets go back they returned to the table kemp picked up his pipe and began to clean it out race looked at anthony puzzled and picked up his cup to finish his tea goodness me he said in great surprise its got sugar in it he looked across at anthony who smiled at him and what on earth is this said kemp after tasting his own cup coffee said anthony i dont think youll like it i didnt chapter twenty five as anthony watched understanding appear in the eyes of the other men a new thought hit him just a minute that car he cried and jumped to his feet im a fool an idiot iris told me that a car had nearly run her over and i hardly listened come on quick she said she was going straight home when she left scotland yard said kemp whos at the house asked race ruth lessing was there waiting for mrs drake to come home and discuss the funeral discussing everything else as well if i know mrs drake said race he added abruptly has iris marle got any other relations not that i know of i see the direction in which your thoughts are leading you but is it physically possible i think so consider for yourself how much has been taken for granted on one persons word you think that miss marle is in danger asked kemp as he paid the bill yes i do the three men hurried out of the cafe and stopped a taxi telling the driver to go to elvaston square as quickly as possible ive only got the general idea so far said kemp as they raced through the london streets it certainly clears the farradays thank goodness but surely there wouldnt be another murder so soon the sooner the better said race before anyone realizes the truth iris told me in front of mrs drake that she would marry browne as soon as he wanted her to as the taxi drew up in elvaston square anthony leapt out and ran up the steps to ring the bell while race paid the fare kemp followed anthony up the steps as the parlourmaid opened the door is miss iris back asked anthony anxiously yes sir half an hour ago he sighed with relief where is she i expect shes in the sitting room with mrs drake anthony nodded and went up the stairs to the sitting room race and kemp following behind him in the sitting room they found lucilla drake searching for a letter in her desk wheres iris demanded anthony lucilla stared at him i beg your pardon who are you recognizing race she smiled she did not notice chief inspector kemp also entering the room colonel race how kind of you to come but i do wish you could have been here a little earlier i would have liked to ask you about the funeral arrangements i was so upset that i couldnt really think miss lessing was very kind and offered to do everything she could to help me but naturally i am the person most likely to know what georges favourite hymns were not that he went to church very often as she paused to take a breath race asked where is miss marle she said she had a headache and was going up to her room i said that was quite all right miss lessing and i were managing perfectly well and she could leave everything to us has miss lessing gone asked kemp yes she went about ten minutes ago canon westbury is to give the funeral service as lucilla went on talking anthony backed silently out of the door and ran up the stairs chief inspector kemp followed close behind him they were on the second floor landing when anthony heard a light footstep coming down the stairs from the floor above he pulled kemp behind a nearby bathroom door as the footsteps continued down the stairs anthony came out of the bathroom and ran up to the third floor iriss room he knew was at the back of the house he knocked on the door iris there was no reply he tried the handle the door was locked in sudden fear he beat loudly upon it iris iris looking down he saw that a woollen mat had been pushed up against the bottom of the door he kicked it away and lay down to press his nose against the gap he smelt the air then leapt up and shouted kemp there was no reply from the chief inspector but colonel race came running up the stairs gas pouring out cried anthony well have to break the door down the two men ran at the door the lock broke and the door flew open shes by the fire said race ill break the window you get her out iris was lying unconscious by the gas fire her face beside the open gas tap coughing and choking from the fumes anthony carried her out onto the stairs and laid her on the floor ill look after her said race go and call a doctor dont worry shell be all right we got here just in time chapter twenty six iris was lying on a sofa in the sitting room at little priors where she had been taken to recover from her terrible experience and now please tony will you tell me all about it she asked anthony smiled widely at colonel race who was sitting by the window in the morning sunshine i must say ive been looking forward to this moment if i dont tell people how clever ive been i shall burst so here goes george discovered that rosemarys death wasnt suicide after all and he started to investigate but before he could reveal her killer he was also murdered however his murder was impossible george couldnt be poisoned but george was poisoned nobody touched georges glass but georges glass was tampered with and then i realized the one important point georges ear is georges ear because it is fixed to his head and cannot be removed without a surgical operation but georges watch might belong to him or might have been lent to him by someone else in the same way georges wine glass simply means the glass from which he has just been drinking there is nothing else to separate it from several other similar glasses to prove this i made an experiment race was drinking tea without sugar kemp was drinking tea with sugar and i was drinking coffee all three drinks looked similar we were sitting at one of several small round tables in a cafe i made an excuse and hurried the others out into the entrance hall knocking their chairs out of position as we stood up i also secretly moved kemps pipe which was lying beside his cup to the same position beside my cup when we returned kemp pulled his chair up to the table again and sat beside his pipe race sat on his right and i sat on his left as before but now the impossible had happened before kemps cup had sweet tea in it now kemps cup contained coffee these two facts cant both be true but they are because kemps cup when he left the table and kemps cup when he returned are not the same thing and that is what happened at the luxembourg that night iris after the cabaret when you went to dance you dropped your bag a waiter picked it up not the waiter who was serving your table and knew which seat was yours but another waiter who was hurrying past and quickly picked up the bag and put it beside the plate one place to the left of yours when you returned you went to the place marked by your bag and george sat down on your right when he proposed his toast in memory of rosemary he drank from what he thought was his glass but was actually your glass a glass which could have been poisoned earlier because the only person who did not drink straight after the cabaret was the person who was being toasted by the other guests and that means you iris you were the intended victim not george if things had gone as planned we would have seen the suicide of the second marle sister a piece of paper which had contained cyanide is found in her bag and the case is clear the poor girl could not cope with her sisters death iris interrupted him but why should anyone want to kill me money my darling you inherited rosemarys fortune but if you died unmarried the money would then go to your closest relative your aunt lucilla and then who else would benefit victor drake who has always exploited his unfortunate mother its easy to see victor as a killer and from the very start of the case he has has been hiding in the shadows but victor has been in south america for over a year has he really you see this story starts with girl meets boy when ruth lessing met victor i think she fell in love with him those quiet sensible women often fall for bad men and the evidence that victor was in south america depends entirely on ruths word it was ruth who reported that victor had sailed away on the ss cristobal before rosemarys death and it was ruth who suggested telephoning buenos aires on the day of georges death then dismissed the telephone operator who knew she did not make the call in fact victor drake had left buenos aires several weeks before but he left behind a telegram to be sent in his name on a certain date another demand for money which would prove that he was still there instead of which he was the mexican sitting with a girlfriend at the table next to ours at the luxembourg bad skin and bloodshot eyes make a simple but effective disguise in our party i was the only person apart from ruth lessing who had ever seen victor drake but i was sitting with my back to him as we came into the restaurant i did recognize a man i wanted to avoid who i had known in prison as monkey coleman but i never imagined that he was connected to the crime or that he and victor drake were the same man but how did he do it it was simple said colonel race during the cabaret he went out to make a telephone call passing our table on the way in the past drake had been both an actor and a waiter pedro morales was an easy role for an actor to play but to move professionally around a table filling up champagne glasses required the skill of a man who had actually been a waiter and none of you noticed him you were watching the cabaret not the waiter and it was ruth who put the cyanide paper in your bag said anthony probably in the cloakroom when you first arrived she did the same thing to rosemary a year ago i always thought it strange that george hadnt told ruth about those letters he took her advice about everything anthony laughed of course he told her she knew he would thats why she wrote them then she helped him to arrange his plan and so she prepared nicely for suicide number two which would be yours and to think i actually wanted her to marry george she would probably have made him a very good wife if she hadnt met victor iris shivered just for money victor certainly did it for money ruth did it for money for victor and also i think because she hated rosemary she had changed greatly by the time she tried to run you down in a car and still further when she left lucilla in the sitting room and ran up to your bedroom did she seem dangerous when you saw her iris considered no she just knocked on my door came in and said everything was arranged and she hoped i was feeling all right i said i was quite tired and after that i dont remember anything because she hit you on the head and knocked you unconscious darling then she put you by the gas fire turned on the tap and went out locking the door and sliding the key back underneath it she pushed the mat up against the door to seal it and crept back down the stairs kemp and i were hiding in the bathroom as she passed i ran up to your room and kemp left to follow ruth to where she had left the car you know i felt at the time there was something strange about the way she tried to convince us that she had come by train and bus iris shuddered its horrible to think someone wanted to kill me did she hate me too oh i dont think so but she didnt want her efforts to be for nothing im sure lucilla told her you had decided to marry me which meant there was no time to lose once we were married i would become the next heir to the fortune poor lucilla im so sorry for her has victor really been arrested race nodded this morning when he arrived in new york was he going to marry ruth she thought so and i think she would have got her way anthony i dont like my money all right sweetheart ive got enough money of my own to keep a wife in comfort lets give yours away to charity i think ill keep a little bit said iris so that if i ever wanted to i could walk out and leave you i dont think thats the right attitude to begin married life with anthony protested laughing colonel race got up im going to have tea with the farradays he smiled broadly at anthony i dont suppose youre coming anthony shook his head and race walked out of the room he turned in the doorway and said good show before closing the door behind him that said anthony is the highest mark of british approval he thought i had done it didnt he asked iris its not his fault he has known so many beautiful spies all stealing secret formulas and classified information that he thinks it must always be the beautiful girl who did it so how did you know i hadnt oh love i suppose smiled anthony browne the end
