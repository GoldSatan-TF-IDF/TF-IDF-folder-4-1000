eleven chapter twelve chapter thirteen chapter fourteen chapter fifteen chapter sixteen chapter seventeen chapter eighteen chapter nineteen chapter twenty prologue contents next phillip quinn died at the age of thirteen since the overworked and underpaid staff at the baltimore city hospital emergency room zapped him back in less than ninety seconds he wasnt dead very long as far as he was concerned it was plenty long enough what had killed him briefly were twocaliber bullets pumped out of a saturday night special shoved through the open window of a stolen toyota celica the finger on the trigger had belonged to a close personal friendвђor as near to a close personal friend as a thirteenyearold thief could claim on baltimores bad streets the bullets missed his heart not by much but in later years phillip considered it just far enough that heart young and strong though sadly jaded continued to beat as he lay there pouring blood over the used condoms and crack vials in the stinking gutter on the corner of fayette and paca the pain was obscene like sharp burning icicles stabbing into his chest but that grinning pain refused to take him under into the release of unconsciousness he lay awake and aware hearing the screams of other victims or bystanders the squeal of brakes the revving of engines and his own ragged and rapid breaths hed just fenced a small haul of electronics that hed stolen from a thirdstory walkup less than four blocks away he had two hundred fifty dollars in his pocket and had swaggered down to score a dime bag to help him get through the night since hed just been sprung from ninety days in juvie for another b and e that hadnt gone quite so smoothly hed been out of the loop and out of cash now it appeared he was out of luck later he would remember thinking shit oh shit this hurts but he couldnt seem to wrap his mind around another thought hed gotten in the way he knew that the bullets hadnt been meant for him in particular hed caught a glimpse of the gang colors in that frozen three seconds before the gun had fired his own colors when he bothered to associate himself with one of the gangs that roamed the streets and alleys of the city if he hadnt just popped out of the system he wouldnt have been on mat corner at that moment he would have been told to stay clear and he wouldnt now be sprawled out pumping blood and staring into the dirty mouth of the gutter lights flashedвђblue red white the scream of sirens pierced through human screams cops even through the slick haze of pain his instinct was to run in his mind he sprang up young agile streetsmart and melted into the shadows but even the effort of the thought had cold sweat sliding down his face he felt a hand on his shoulder and fingers probed until they reached the thready pulse in his throat this ones breathing get the paramedics over here someone turned him over the pain was unspeakable but he couldnt release the scream that ripped through his head he saw faces swimming over him the hard eyes of a cop the grim ones of the medical technician red blue and white lights burned his eyes someone wept in high keening sobs hang in there kid why he wanted to ask why it hurt to be there he was never going to escape as hed once promised himself he would what was left of his life was running red into the gutter what had come before was only ugliness what was now was only pain what was the damn point he went away for a while sinking down below the pain where the world was a dark and dingy red from somewhere outside his world came the shriek of the sirens the pressure on his chest the speeding motion of the ambulance then lights again bright white to sear his closed lids and he was flying while voices shouted on all sides of him bullet wounds chest bps eighty over fifty and falling pulse thready and rapid in and out pupils are good type and crossmatch we need pictures on three one two three his body seemed to jerk up then down he no longer cared even the dingy red was going gray a tube was pushing its way down his throat and he didnt bother to try to cough it out he barely felt it barely felt anything and thanked god for it bps dropping were losing him ive been lost a long time he thought with vague interest he watched them half a dozen greensuited people in a small room where a tall blond boy lay on a table blood was everywhere his blood he realized he was on that table with his chest torn open he looked down at himself with detached sympathy no more pain now and the quiet sense of relief nearly made him smile he floated higher until the scene below took on a pearly sheen and the sounds were nothing but echoes then the pain tore through him an abrupt shock that made the body on the table jerk that sucked him back his struggle to pull away was brief and fruitless he was inside again feeling again lost again the next thing he knew he was riding in a drughazed blur someone was snoring the room was dark and the bed narrow and hard a backwash of light filtered through a pane of glass that was spotted with fingerprints machines beeped and sucked monotonously wanting only to escape the sounds he rolled back under he was in and out for two days he was very lucky thats what they told him there was a pretty nurse with tired eyes and a doctor with graying hair and thin lips he wasnt ready to believe them not when he was too weak to lift his head not when the hideous pain swarmed back into him every two hours like clockwork when the two cops came in he was awake and the pain was smothered under a few layers of morphine he made them out to be cops at a glance his instincts werent so dulled that he didnt recognize the walk the shoes the eyes he didnt need the identification they flashed at him gotta smoke phillip asked it of everyone who passed through he had a lowgrade desperation for nicotine even though he doubted he could manage to suck on a cigarette youre too young to smoke the first cop pasted on an avuncular smile and stationed himself on one side of the bed the good cop phillip thought wearily im getting older every minute youre lucky to be alive the second cop kept his face hard as he pulled out a notebook and the bad cop phillip decided he was nearly amused thats what they keep telling me so what the hell happened you tell us bad cop poised his pencil over a page of his book i got the shit shot out of me what were you doing on the street i think i was going home hed already decided how to play it and he let his eyes close i cant remember exactly id beenвђ at the movies he made it a question opening his eyes he could see bad cop wasnt going to buy it but what could they do what movie did you see who were you with look i dont know its all messed up one minute i was walking the next i was lying facedown just tell us what you remember good cop laid a hand on phillips shoulder take your time it happened fast i heard shotsвђit must have been shots somebody was screaming and it was like something exploded in my chest that much was pretty close to the truth did you see a car did you see the shooter both were etched like acid on steel in his brain i think i saw a carвђdark color a flash you belong to the flames phillip shifted his gaze to bad cop i hang with them sometimes three of the bodies we scraped off the street were members of the tribe they werent as lucky as you the flames and the tribe have a lot of bad blood between them so ive heard you took two bullets phil good cop settled his face into concerned lines another inch either way youd have been dead before you hit the pavement you look like a smart kid a smart kid doesnt fool himself into believing he needs to be loyal to assholes i didnt see anything it wasnt loyalty it was survival if he rolled over he was dead you had over two hundred in your wallet phillip shrugged regretting it as the movement stirred up the ghosts of pain yeah well maybe i can pay my bill here at the hilton dont smartmouth me you little punk bad cop leaned over the bed i see your kind every fucking day youre not out of the system twenty hours before you end up bleeding into the gutter phillip didnt flinch is getting shot a violation of my parole whered you get the money i dont remember you were down in drug city to score did you find any drugs on me maybe we did you wouldnt remember would you good one phillip mused i could sure as hell use some now ease off a little good cop shifted his feet look son you cooperate and well play square with you youve been in and out of the system enough to know how it works if the system worked i wouldnt be here would i you cant do anything to me that hasnt been done for christs sake if id known something was going down i wouldnt have been there the sudden disturbance out in the hall took the cops attention away phillip merely closed his eyes he recognized the voice raised in bitter fury stoned was his first and last thought and when she stumbled into the room he opened his eyes and saw that hed been right on target shed dressed up for the visit he noted her yellow hair was teased and sprayed into submission and shed put on full makeup under it she might have been a pretty woman but the mask was hard and tough her body was good it was what kept her in business strippers who moonlight as hookers need a good package shed peeled on a halter and jeans and she clicked her way over to the bed on threeinch heels who the hell do you thinks gonna pay for this youre nothing but trouble hi ma nice to see you too dont you sass me i got cops coming to the door cause of you im sick of it she flashed a look at the men on either side of the bed like her son she recognized cops hes almost fourteen years old im done with him he aint coming back on me this time i aint having cops and social workers breathing down my neck anymore she shrugged off the nurse who hustled in to grab her arm then leaned over the bed why the hell didnt you just die i dont know phillip said calmly i tried youve never been any good she hissed at good cop when he pulled her back never been any damn good dont you come around looking for a place to stay when you get out of here she shouted as she was dragged out of the room im done with you phillip waited listening to her swearing shouting demanding papers to sign to get him out of her life then he looked up at bad cop you think you can scare me i live with that nothings worse than living with that two days later strangers came into the room the man was huge with blue eyes bright in a wide face the woman had wild red hair escaping from a messy knot at the nape of her neck and a face full of freckles the woman took his chart from the foot of the bed scanned it then tapped it against her palm hello phillip im dr stella quinn this is my husband ray yeah so ray pulled a chair up to the side of the bed and sat down with a sigh of pleasure he angled his head studied phillip briefly youve got yourself into a hell of a mess here havent you want to get out of it chapter one contents prev next phillip loosened the windsor knot in his fendi tie it was a long commute from baltimore to marylands eastern shore and hed programmed his cd player with that in mind he started out mellow with a little tom petty and the heartbreakers thursdayevening traffic was as bad as predicted made worse by the sluggish rain and the rubberneckers who couldnt resist a long fascinated goggle at the threecar accident on the baltimore beltway by the time he was heading south on route even the hot licks of vintage stones couldnt completely lift his mood hed brought work with him and somehow had to eke out time for the myerstone tire account over the weekend they wanted a whole new look for this advertising campaign happy tires make happy drivers phillip thought drumming his fingers on the wheel to the rhythm of keith richardss outlaw guitar which was a crock he decided nobody was happy driving in rainy rushhour traffic no matter what rubber covered their wheels but hed come up with something that would make the consumers think that riding on myerstones would make them happy safe and sexy it was his job and he was good at it good enough to juggle four major accounts supervise the status of six lesser ones and never appear to break a sweat within the slick corridors of innovations the wellheeled advertising firm where he worked the firm that demanded style exuberance and creativity from its executives they didnt pay to see him sweat alone however was a different matter he knew hed been burning not a candle but a torch at both ends for months with one hard slap of fate hed gone from living for phillip quinn to wondering what had happened to his cheerfully upwardly mobile urban lifestyle his fathers death six months before had turned his life upside down the life that ray and stella quinn had righted seventeen years ago theyd walked into that dreary hospital room and offered him a chance and a choice hed taken the chance because hed been smart enough to understand that he had no choice going back on the streets wasnt as appealing as it had been before his chest had been ripped open by bullets living with his mother was no longer an option not even if she changed her mind and let him buy his way back into the cramped apartment on baltimores block social services was taking a hard look at the situation and he knew hed be dumped into the system the minute he was back on his feet he had no intention of going back into the system or back with his mother or back to the gutter for that matter hed already decided that he felt that all he needed was a little time to work out a plan at the moment that time was buffered by some very fine drugs that he hadnt had to buy or steal but he didnt figure that little benefit was going to last forever with the demerol sliding through his system he gave the quinns a canny onceover and dismissed them as a couple of weirdo dogooders that was fine with him they wanted to be samaritans give him a place to hang out until he was back to a hundred percent good for them good for him they told him they had a house on the eastern shore which for an innercity kid was the other end of the world but he figured a change of scene couldnt hurt they had two sons about his age phillip decided he wouldnt have to worry about a couple of wimps that the dogooders had raised they told him they had rules and education was a priority school didnt bother him any he breezed his way through when he decided to go no drugs stella said that in a cool voice that made phillip reevaluate her as he put on his most angelic expression and said a polite no maam he had no doubt that when he wanted a hit hed be able to find a source even in some bumfuck town on the bay then stella leaned over the bed her eyes shrewd her mouth smiling thinly you have a face that belongs on a renaissance painting but that doesnt make you less of a thief a hoodlum and a liar well help you if you want to be helped but dont treat us like imbeciles and ray laughed his big booming laugh he squeezed stellas shoulder and phillips at the same time it would be phillip remembered hed said a rare treat to watch the two of them butt heads for the next little while they came back several times over the next two weeks phillip talked with them and with the social worker whod been much easier to con than the quinns in the end they took him home from the hospital to the pretty white house by the water he met their sons assessed the situation when he learned that the other boys cameron and ethan had been taken in much as he had been he was certain they were all lunatics he figured on biding his time for a doctor and a college professor they hadnt collected an abundance of easily stolen or fenced valuables but he scoped out what there was instead of stealing from them he fell in love with them he took their name and spent the next ten years in the house by the water then stella had died and part of his world dropped away she had become the mother hed never believed existed steady strong loving and shrewd he grieved for her that first true loss of his life he buried part of that grief in work pushing his way through college toward a goal of success and a sheen of sophisticationвђand an entrylevel position at innovations he didnt intend to remain on the bottom rung for long taking the position at innovations in baltimore was a small personal triumph he was going back to the city of his misery but he was going back as a man of taste no one seeing the man in the tailored suit would suspect that hed once been a petty thief a sometime drug dealer and an occasional prostitute everything hed gained over the last seventeen years could be traced back to that moment when ray and stella quinn had walked into his hospital room then ray had died suddenly leaving shadows that had yet to be washed with the light the man phillip had loved as completely as a son could love a father had lost his life on a quiet stretch of road in the middle of the day when his car had met a telephone pole at high speed there was another hospital room this time it was the mighty quinn lying broken in the bed with machines gasping phillip along with his brothers had made a promise to watch out for and to keep the last of ray quinns strays another lost boy but this boy had secrets and he looked at you with rays eyes the talk around the waterfront and the neighborhoods of the little town of st christophers on marylands eastern shore hinted of adultery of suicide of scandal in the six months since the whispers had started phillip felt that he and his brothers had gotten no closer to finding the truth who was seth delauter and what had he been to raymond quinn another stray another halfgrown boy drowning in a vicious sea of neglect and violence who so desperately needed a lifeline or was he more a quinn by blood as well as by circumstance all phillip could be sure of was that tenyearold seth was his brother as much as cam and ethan were his brothers each of them had been snatched out of a nightmare and given a chance to change their lives with seth ray and stella werent there to keep that choice open there was a part of phillip a part that had lived inside a young careless thief that resented even the possibility that seth could be rays son by blood a son conceived in adultery and abandoned in shame it would be a betrayal of everything the quinns had taught him everything they had shown him by living their lives as they had he detested himself for considering it for knowing that now and then he studied seth with cool appraising eyes and wondered if the boys existence was the reason ray quinn was dead whenever that nasty thought crept into his mind phillip shifted his concentration to gloria delauter seths mother was the woman who had accused professor raymond quinn of sexual harassment she claimed it had happened years before while she was a student at the university but there was no record of her ever attending classes there the same woman had sold her tenyearold son to ray as if hed been a package of meat the same woman phillip was certain that ray had been to baltimore to see before he had driven homeвђand driven himself to his death shed taken off women like gloria were skilled in skipping out of harms way weeks ago shed sent the quinns a notsosubtle blackmail letter if you want to keep the kid i need more phillips jaw clenched when he remembered the naked fear on seths face when hed learned of it she wasnt going to get her hands on the boy he told himself she was going to discover that the quinn brothers were a tougher mark than one softhearted old man not just the quinn brothers now either he thought as he turned off onto the rural county road that would lead him home he thought of family as he drove fast down a road flanked by fields of soybeans of peas of corn grown taller than a man now that cam and ethan were married seth had two determined women to stand with him as well married phillip shook his head in amused wonder who would have thought it cam had hitched himself to the sexy social worker and ethan was married to sweeteyed grace and had become an instant father phillip mused to angelfaced aubrey well good for them in fact he had to admit that anna spinelli and grace monroe were tailormade for his brothers it would only add to their strength as a family when it came time for the hearing on permanent guardianship of seth and marriage certainly appeared to suit them even if the word itself gave him the willies for himself phillip much preferred the single life and all its benefits not that hed had much time to avail himself of all those benefits in the past few months weekends in st chris supervising homework assignments pounding a hull together for the fledgling boats by quinn dealing with the books for the new business hauling groceriesвђall of which had somehow become his domainвђcramped a mans style hed promised his father on his deathbed that he would take care of seth with his brothers hed made a pact to move back to the shore to share the guardianship and the responsibilities for phillip that pact meant splitting his time between baltimore and st chris and his energies between maintaining his careerвђand his incomeвђand tending to a new and often problematic brother and a new business it was all a risk raising a tenyearold wasnt without headaches and fumbling mistakes under the best of circumstances he imagined seth delauter raised by a parttime hooker fulltime junkie and amateur extortionist had hardly come through the best of circumstances getting a boatbuilding enterprise off the ground was a series of irksome details and backbreaking labor yet somehow it was working and if he discounted the ridiculous demands on his time and energy it was working fairly well not so long ago his weekends had been spent in the company of any number of attractive interesting women having dinner at some new hot spot an evening at the theater or a concert and if the chemistry was right a quiet sunday brunch in bed hed get back to that phillip promised himself once all the details were in place he would have his life back again but as his father would have said for the next little whileвђ he turned into the drive the rain had stopped leaving a light sheen of wet on the leaves and grass twilight was creeping in he could see the light in the living room window glowing in a soft and steady welcome some of the summer flowers that anna had babied along were hanging on and early fall blooms shimmered in the shadows he could hear the puppy barking though at nine months foolish had grown too big and sleek to be considered a puppy anymore it was annas night to cook he remembered thank god it meant a real meal would be served at the quinns he rolled his shoulders thought about pouring himself a glass of wine then watched foolish dash around the side of the house in pursuit of a mangy yellow tennis ball the sight of phillip getting out of his car obviously distracted the dog from the game he skidded to a halt and set up a din of wild terrified barking idiot but he grinned as he pulled his briefcase out of the jeep at the familiar voice the barking turned into mad joy foolish bounded up with a delighted look in his eyes and wet muddy paws no jumping phillip yelled using his briefcase like a shield i mean it sit foolish quivered but dropped his rump on the ground and lifted a paw his tongue lolled his eyes gleamed thats a good dog gingerly phillip shook the filthy paw and scratched the dogs silky ears hey seth wandered into the front yard his jeans were grubby from wrestling with the dog his baseball cap was askew so that strawstraight blond hair spiked out of it the smile phillip noted came much more quickly and easily than it had a few months before but there was a gap in it hey phillip butted a finger on the bill of the cap lose something huh phillip tapped a finger against his own straight white teeth oh yeah with a typical quinn shrug seth grinned pushing his tongue into the gap his face was fuller than it had been six months before and his eyes less wary it was loose had to give it a yank a couple of days ago bled like a son of a bitch phillip didnt bother to sigh over seths language some things he determined werent going to be his problem so did the tooth fairy bring you anything get real hey if you didnt squeeze a buck out of cam youre no brother of mine i got two bucks out of it one from cam and one from ethan laughing phillip swung an arm over seths shoulders and headed toward the house well youre not getting one out of me pal im on to you how was the first full week of school boring though it hadnt been seth admitted silently it had been exciting all the new junk anna had taken him shopping for sharp pencils blank notebooks pens full of ink hed refused the xfiles lunch box shed wanted to get him only a dork carried a lunch box in middle school but it had been really cool and tough to sneer at he had cool clothes and bitching sneakers and best of all for the first time in his life he was in the same place the same school with the same people hed left behind in june homework phillip asked raising his eyebrows as he opened the front door seth rolled his eyes man dont you ever think about anything else kid i live for homework especially when its yours foolish burst through the door ahead of phillip nearly knocking him down with enthusiasm youve still got some work to do on that dog but the mild annoyance faded instantly he could smell annas red sauce simmering like ambrosia on the air god bless us every one he murmured manicotti seth informed him yeah ive got a chianti ive been saving just for this moment he tossed his briefcase aside well hit the books after dinner he found his sisterinlaw in the kitchen filling pasta tubes with cheese the sleeves of the crisp white shirt shed worn to the office were rolled up and a white butchers apron covered her navy skirt shed taken off her heels and tapped a bare foot to the beat of the aria she was humming carmen phillip recognized her wonderful mass of curling black hair was still pinned up with a wink at seth phillip came up behind her caught her around the waist and pressed a noisy kiss onto the top of her head run away with me well change our names you can be sophia and ill be carlo let me take you to paradise where you can cook for me and me alone none of these peasants appreciate you like i do let me just finish this tube carlo and ill go pack she turned her head her dark italian eyes laughing dinner in thirty minutes ill open the wine dont we have anything to eat now seth wanted to know theres antipasto in the fridge she told him go ahead and get it out its just vegetables and junk seth complained when he pulled out the platter yep jeez wash the dog off your hands before you start on that dog spits cleaner than people spit seth informed her i read how if you get bit by another guy its worse than getting bit by a dog im thrilled to have that fascinating tidbit of information wash the dog spit off your hands anyway man disgusted seth clomped out with foolish slinking after him phillip chose the wine from the small supply he kept in the pantry fine wines were one of his passions and his palate was extremely discriminating his apartment in baltimore boasted an extensive and carefully chosen selection which he kept in a closet hed remodeled specifically for that purpose at the shore his beloved bottles of bordeaux and burgundy kept company with rice krispies and boxes of jello instant pudding hed learned to live with it so how was your week he asked anna busy whoever said women can have everything should be shot handling a career and a family is grueling then she looked up with a brilliant smile im loving it it shows he drew the cork expertly sniffed it and approved then set the bottle on the counter to breathe wheres cam should be on his way home from the boatyard he and ethan wanted to put in an extra hour the first boat by quinn is finished the owners coming in tomorrow its finished phillip her smile flashed brilliant and glowing with pride at dock seaworthy and just gorgeous he felt a little tug of disappointment that he hadnt been in on the last day we should be having champagne anna lifted a brow as she studied the label on the wine a bottle of folonari ruffino he considered one of annas finest traits to be her appreciation for good wine seventyfive he said with a broad grin you wont hear any complaints from me congratulations mr quinn on your first boat its not my deal i just handle the details and pass for slave labor of course its your deal details are necessary and neither cam nor ethan could handle them with the finesse you do i think the word they use is nagging they need to be nagged you should be proud of what the three of you have accomplished in the last few months not just the new business but the family each one of you has given up something thats important to you for seth and each one of you has gotten something important back i never expected the kid to matter so much while anna smothered the filled tubes with sauce phillip opened a cupboard for wineglasses i still have moments when the whole thing pisses me off thats only natural phillip doesnt make me feel any better about it he shrugged his shoulders in dismissal then poured two glasses but most of the time i look at him and think hes a pretty good deal for a kid brother anna grated cheese over the casserole out of the corner of her eye she watched phillip lift his glass appreciate the bouquet he was beautiful to look at she mused physically he was as close to male perfection as she could imagine bronze hair thick and full eyes more gold than brown his face was long narrow thoughtful both sensual and angelic his tall trim build seemed to have been fashioned for italian suits but since shed seen him stripped to the waist in faded levis she knew there was nothing soft about him sophisticated tough erudite shrewd an interesting man she mused she slipped the casserole into the oven then turned to pick up her wine smiling at him she tapped her glass on his youre a pretty good deal too phillip for a big brother she leaned in to kiss him lightly as cam walked in get your mouth off my wife phillip merely smiled and slid an arm around annas waist she put hers on me she likes me she likes me better to prove it cam hooked a hand in the tie of annas apron spun her around and pulled her into his arms to kiss her brainless he grinned nipped her bottom lip and patted her butt companionably doncha sugar her head was still spinning probably she blew out a breath all things considered but she wiggled free youre filthy just came in to grab a beer to take into the shower long and lean dark and dangerous he prowled over to the fridge and kiss my wife he added with a smug look at phillip go get your own woman who has time phillip said mournfully after dinner and an hour spent slaving over long division battles of the revolutionary war and sixthgrade vocabulary phillip settled down in his room with his laptop and his files it was the same room hed been given when ray and stella quinn had brought him home the walls had been a pale green then sometime during his sixteenth year hed gotten a wild hair and painted them magenta god knew why he remembered that his motherвђfor stella had become his mother by thenвђhad taken one look and warned him hed have terminal indigestion he thought it was sexy for about three months then hed gone with a stark white for a while accented with moody blackframed blackandwhite photographs always looking for ambience phillip thought now amused at himself hed circled back to that soft green right before he moved to baltimore theyd been right all along he supposed his parents had usually been right theyd given him this room in this house in this place he hadnt made it easy for them the first three months were a battle of wills he smuggled in drugs picked fights stole liquor and stumbled in drunk at dawn it was clear to him now that hed been testing them daring them to kick him out toss him back go ahead hed thought you cant handle me but they did they had not only handled him they had made him i wonder phillip his father had said why you want to waste a good mind and a good body why you want to let the bastards win phillip who was suffering from the raw gut and bursting head of a drug and alcohol hangover didnt give a good damn ray took him out on the boat telling him that a good sail would clear his head sick as a dog phillip leaned over the rail throwing up the remnants of the poisons hed pumped into his system the night before hed just turned fourteen ray anchored the boat in a narrow gut he held phillips head wiped his face then offered him a cold can of ginger ale sit down he didnt so much sit as collapse his hands shook his stomach shuddered at the first sip from the can ray sat across from him his big hands on his knees his silvering hair flowing in the light breeze and those eyes those brilliant blue eyes level and considering youve had a couple of months now to get your bearings around here stella says youve come around physically youre strong and healthy enoughвђthough you arent going to stay that way if you keep this up he pursed his lips said nothing for a long moment there was a heron in the tall grass still as a painting the air was bright and chill with late fall the trees bare of leaves so that the hard blue sky spread overhead wind ruffled the grass and skimmed fingers over the water the man sat apparently content with the silence and the scene the boy slouched pale of face and hard of eye we can play this a lot of ways phil ray said at length we can be hardasses we can put you on a short leash watch you every minute and bust your balls every time you screw up which is most of the time considering ray picked up a fishing rod absently baited it with a marshmallow or we could all just say that this little experiments a bust and you can go back into the system phillips stomach churned making him swallow to hold down what he didnt quite recognize as fear i dont need you i dont need anybody yeah you do ray said it mildly as he dropped the line into the water ripples spread endlessly you go back into the system youll stay there couple of years down the road it wont be juvie anymore youll end up in a cell with the bad guys the kind of guys who are going to take a real liking to that pretty face of yours some sevenfoot con with hands like smoked hams is going to grab you in the showers one fine day and make you his bride phillip yearned desperately for a cigarette the image conjured by rays word made fresh sweat pop out on his forehead i can take care of myself son theyll pass you around like canapгs and you know it you talk a good game and you fight a good fight but some things are inevitable up to this point your life has pretty much sucked youre not responsible for that but you are responsible for what happens from here on he fell into silence again clamping the pole between his knees before reaching for a cold can of pepsi taking his time ray popped the top tipped the can back and guzzled stella and i thought we saw something in you he continued we still do he added looking at phillip again but until you do were not going to get anywhere what do you care phillip tossed back miserably hard to say at the moment maybe youre not worth it maybe youll just end up back on the streets hustling marks and turning tricks anyway for three months hed had a decent bed regular meals and all the books he could readвђone of his secret lovesвђat his disposal at the thought of losing it his throat filled again but he only shrugged ill get by if all you want to do is get by thats your choice here you can have a home a family you can have a life and make something out of it or you can go on the way you are ray reached over to phillip quickly and the boy braced himself for the blow clenched his fists to return it but ray only pulled phillips shirt up to expose the livid scars on his chest you can go back to that he said quietly phillip looked into rays eyes he saw compassion and hope and he saw himself mirrored back bleeding in a dirty gutter on a street where life was worth less than a dime bag sick tired terrified phillip dropped his head into his hands whats the point youre the point son ray ran his hand over phillips hair youre the point things hadnt changed overnight phillip thought now but they had begun to change his parents had made him believe in himself despite himself it had become a point of pride for him to do well in school to learn to remake himself into phillip quinn he figured hed done a good job of it hed coated that street kid with a sheen of class he had a slick career a wellappointed condo with a killer view of the inner harbor and a wardrobe that suited both it seemed that hed come full circle spending his weekends back in this room with its green walls and sturdy furniture with its windows that overlooked the trees and the marsh but this time seth was the point chapter two contents prev next phillip stood on the foredeck of the yettobechristened neptunes lady hed personally sweated out nearly two thousand manhours to take her from design to finished sloop her decks were gleaming teak her bright work glinted in the yellow september sun belowdecks her cabin was a woodworkers pride cams for the most part phillip mused glossy cabinets were fashioned of natural wood handfitted and customdesigned with sleeping room for four close friends she was sound he thought and she was beautiful aesthetically charming with her fluid hull glossy decks and long waterline ethans early decision to use the smoothlap method of planking had added hours to the labor but had produced a gem the podiatrist from dc was going to pay handsomely for every inch of her wellвђ ethan hands in the pockets of his faded jeans eyes squinting comfortably against the sun left it an openended question phillip ran a hand over the satin finish of the gunwale an area hed spent many sweaty hours sanding and finishing she deserves a less clichгd name the owners got more money than imagination she takes the wind ethans lips curved into one of his slow serious smiles good christ she goes phil when cam and i tested her out i wasnt sure he was going to bring her back in wasnt sure i wanted him to phillip rubbed a thumb over his chin ive got a friend in baltimore who paints most of the stuff he does is strictly commercial for hotels and restaurants but he does terrific stuff on the side every time he sells one he bitches about it hates to let a canvas go i didnt really understand how he felt until now and shes our first but not our last phillip hadnt expected to feel so attached the boatbuilding business hadnt been his idea or his choice he liked to think his brothers had dragged him into it hed told them it was insane ridiculous doomed to fail then of course hed jumped in and negotiated for the rental of the building applied for licenses ordered the necessary utilities during the construction of what was about to become neptunes lady hed dug splinters out of his fingers nursed burns from hot creosote soaked muscles that wept after hours of lifting planks and had not suffered in silence but with this tangible result of long months of labor swaying gracefully under his feet he had to admit it was all worth it now they were about to start all over again you and cam made some headway this week on the next project we want to have the hull ready to turn the end of october ethan took out a bandanna and methodically polished phillips fingerprints off the gunwale if were going to keep to that killer schedule you worked up got a little bit more to do on this one though this one eyes narrowed phillip tipped down his wayfarers damn it ethan you said she was ready to go the owners coming in to take her i was about to go in and work up the last of the papers on her just one little detail have to wait for cam what little detail impatient phillip checked his watch the clients due here any minute wont take long ethan nodded toward the cargo doors of the building heres cam now shes too good for this yahoo cam called out as he came down the narrow dock with a batteryoperated drill im telling you we should get the wives and kids and sail her off to bimini ourselves shes good enough for the final draw hes going to give us today once he gives me that certified check hes the captain phillip waited until cam stepped nimbly aboard when i get to bimini i dont want to see either of you hes just jealous because weve got women cam told ethan here he shoved the drill into phillips hand what the hell am i supposed to do with this finish her grinning cam pulled a brass cleat out of his back pocket we saved the last piece for you yeah absurdly touched phillip took the cleat watched it wink in the sun we started her together ethan pointed out seemed only right it goes on the starboard phillip took the screws cam handed him and bent over the markings on the rail i figured we should celebrate after the drill whirled in his hands i thought about a bottle of dom he said raising his voice over the noise but figured itd be wasted on the two of you so ive got three harps chilling down in the cooler they would go well he thought with the little surprise he was having delivered later that afternoon it was nearly noon before the client had finished fussing over every inch of his new boat ethan had been elected to take the man out for a shakedown sail before they loaded the sloop onto its new trailer from the dock phillip watched the butteryellow sailsвђthe clients choiceвђfill with the wind ethan was right he thought she moved the sloop skimmed toward the waterfront heeled in like a dream he imagined the latesummer tourists would stop to watch point out the pretty boat to each other there was he thought no better advertising than a quality product hell run her aground the first time he sails her on his own cam said from behind him sure but hell have fun he gave cam a slap on the shoulder ill just go write up that bill of sale the old brick building they rented and had modified for the boatyard didnt boast many amenities the lions share was a vast open space with fluorescent lights hanging from the rafters the windows were small and always seemed to be coated with dust power tools lumber equipment gallons of epoxy and varnish and bottom paint were set up where they could be easily reached the lofting platform was currently occupied by the bare skeleton of the hull for the customdesigned sports fisher that was their second job the walls were pitted brick and unfinished sheetrock up a steep flight of iron stairs was a cramped windowless room that served as the office despite its size and location phillip had it meticulously organized the metal desk might have been a flea market special but it was scrubbed clean on its surface was a monthataglance calendar his old laptop computer a wire in out box a twoline phone answering machine and a lucite holder for pens and pencils crowded in with the desk were two file cabinets a personal copier and a plainpaper fax he settled in his chair and booted up the computer the blinking light on the phone caught his eye when he punched it for messages he found two hangups and dismissed them within moments hed brought up the program hed customized for the business and found himself grinning at the logo for boats by quinn they might be flying by the seat of their pants he mused as he plugged in the data for the sale but it didnt have to look that way hed justified the highgrade paper as an advertising expense desktop publishing was second nature to him creating stationery receipts bills was simple enoughвђhe simply insisted that they have class he shot the job to the printer just as the phone rang boats by quinn there was a hesitation then the sound of throat clearing sorry wrong number the voice was muffled and female and quickly gone no problem sweetheart phillip said to the dial tone as he plucked the printed bill of sale from the machine there goes a happy man cam commented an hour later when the three of them watched their client drive off with the trailered sloop were happier phillip took the check out of his pocket and held it out factoring in equipment labor overhead suppliesвђ he folded the check in half again well we cleared enough to get by try to control your enthusiasm cam muttered you got a check for five figures in your hot little hand lets crack open those beers the bulk of the profits have to go right back into the business phillip warned as they started inside once the cold weather hits our utility bills going to go through the roof he glanced up at the soaring ceiling literally and weve got quarterly taxes due next week cam twisted the top off a bottle and pushed it at his brother shut up phil however phillip continued ignoring him this is a fine moment in quinn history he lifted his beer tapped the bottle to both cams and ethans to our foot doctor the first of many happy clients may he sail clean and heal many bunions may he tell all his friends to call boats by quinn cam added may he sail in annapolis and keep out of my part of the bay ethan finished with a shake of his head whos springing for lunch cam wanted to know im starving grace made sandwiches ethan told him theyre out in my cooler god bless her might want to put off lunch just a bit phillip heard the sound of tires on gravel i think what ive been waiting for just got here he strolled out pleased to see the delivery truck the driver leaned out the window worked a wad of gum into his cheek quinn thats right whatd you buy now cam frowned at the truck wondering how much of that brandnew check was flying away something we need hes going to need a hand with it you got that right the driver huffed as he climbed out of the cab took three of us to load her up son of a bitch weighs two hundred pounds if it weighs an ounce he hauled open the back doors it lay on the bed on top of a padded cloth it was easily ten feet long six high and three inches thick carved in simple block letters into treated oak were the words boats by quinn a detailed image of a wooden skiff in full sail rode the top corner lining the bottom corner were the names cameron ethan phillip and seth quinn thats a damn fine sign ethan managed when he could find the words i took one of seths sketches for the skiff the same one we use for the logo on the letterhead put the design together on the computer at work phillip reached in to run a thumb along the side of the oak the sign company did a pretty good job of reproducing it its great cam rested his hand on phillips shoulder one of the details weve been missing christ the kids going to flip when he sees it i put us down the way we came along works out alphabetical and chronological i wanted to keep it clean and simple he stepped back his hands sliding into his pockets in an unconscious mirroring of his brothers stances i thought this fit the building and what were doing in it its good ethan nodded its right the driver shoved at his gum again well you guys gonna admire it all day or you want to get this heavy bastard out of the truck they made a picture she thought three exceptional specimens of the male species engaged in manual labor on a warm afternoon in early september the building certainly suited them it was rough the old brick faded and pitted the grounds around it scrabblyвђmore weeds than grass three different looks as well one of the men was dark with his hair long enough to pull back in a short ponytail his jeans were black fading to gray there was something vaguely european about his style she decided he would be cameron quinn the one whod made a name for himself on the racing circuit the second wore scuffed work boots that looked ancient his sunstreaked hair tumbled out of a bluebilled ball cap he moved fluidly and lifted his end of the sign with no visible effort he would be ethan quinn the waterman which meant the third man was phillip quinn the advertising executive who worked at the top firm in baltimore he looked gilded she thought wayfarers and levis she mused bronzed hair that must be a joy to his stylist a long trim body that must see regular workouts at the health club interesting physically they bore no resemblance to each other and through her research she knew they shared a name but not blood yet there was something in the body language in the way they moved as a team that indicated they were brothers she intended simply to pass by to give the building where they based their business a quick look and evaluation though shed known that at least one of them would be there since hed answered the phone she hadnt expected to see them outside as a group to have this opportunity to study them she was a woman who appreciated the unexpected nerves shimmered in her stomach out of habit she took three slow breaths and rolled her shoulders to relax them casual she reminded herself there was nothing to be uneasy about after all she had the advantage here she knew them and they didnt know her it was typical behavior she decided as she crossed the street a person strolling along and seeing three men working to hang an impressive new sign would display curiosity and interest particularly a smalltown tourist which was for this purpose what she was she was also a single female and they were three very attractive men a mild flirtation would be typical as well still when she reached the front of the building she stood back it seemed to be difficult and precarious work the sign was bolted to thick black chains and wrapped in rope theyd worked out a pulley system with the ad exec on the roof guiding and his brothers on the ground hauling encouragement curses and directions were issued with equal enthusiasm there were certainly a lot of muscles rippling she observed with a lift of her brow your end cam give me another inch goddamn grunting phillip dropped onto his belly and squirmed out far enough that she held her breath and waited for gravity to do its work but he managed to balance himself and snag the chain she could see his mouth working as he fought to loop the heavy link around a thick hook but she couldnt hear what he was saying she thought that might be for the best got it hold it steady he ordered rising to tightwalk his way across the eaves to the other end the sun struck his hair gleamed over his skin she caught herself goggling this she thought was a prime example of sheer male beauty then he was bellying over the edge again grabbing for the chain hauling it into place and swearing ripely when he rose he scowled at the long tear down the front of his shirt where she supposed it had caught on something on the roof i just bought this sucker it was real pretty too cam called up kiss my ass phillip suggested and tugged the shirt off to use it to mop sweat off his face oh well now she thought appreciating the view on a purely personal level the young american god she decided designed to make females drool he hooked the ruined shirt in his back pocket started for the ladder and thats when he spotted her she couldnt see his eyes but she could tell by the momentary pause the angle of the head that he was looking at her the evaluation would be instinctive she knew male sees female studies considers decides hed seen her all right and as he started down the ladder was already considering and hoping for a closer look weve got company phillip murmured and cam glanced over his shoulder hmmm very nice been there ten minutes ethan dusted his hands on his hips watching the show phillip stepped off the ladder turned and smiled so he called out to her hows it look curtain up she thought and started forward very impressive i hope you dont mind the audience i couldnt resist not at all its a big day for the quinns he held out a hand im phillip im sybill and you build boats thats what the sign says fascinating im spending some time in the area i hadnt expected to stumble across boatbuilders what sort of boats do you build wooden sailing vessels really she turned her easy smile toward his brothers and youre partners cam he returned the smile jerked a thumb my brother ethan nice to meet you cameron she began shifting her gaze to read from the sign ethan phillip her heartbeat accelerated but she kept the polite smile in place wheres seth in school phillip told her oh college middle hes ten i see there were scars on his chest she saw now old and shiny and riding dangerously close to his heart you have a very impressive sign boats by quinn id love to drop by sometime and see you and your brothers at work anytime how long are you staying in st chris depends it was nice to meet you all time to retreat she decided her throat was dry her pulse unsteady good luck with your boats drop by tomorrow phillip suggested as she walked away catch all four quinns at work she shot a look over her shoulder that she hoped revealed nothing more than amused interest i might just do that seth she thought careful now to keep her eyes straight ahead hed just given her the open door to see seth the following day cam gave a quiet and male hum i gotta say theres a woman who knows how to walk yes indeed phillip hooked his hands in his pockets and enjoyed the view slim hips and slender legs in breezy maizecolored slacks a snug little shirt the color of limes tucked into a narrow waist a sleek and swinging fall of minkcolored hair just skimming strong shoulders and the face had been just as attractive a classic oval with peachesandcream skin a mobile and shapely mouth tinted with a soft soft pink sexy eyebrows he mused dark and well arched he hadnt been able to see the eyes under them not through the trendy wireframed sunglasses they might be dark to match the hair or light for contrast and that smooth contralto voice had set the whole package off nicely you guys going to stand there watching that womans butt all day ethan wanted to know yeah like you didnt notice it cam snorted i noticed im just not making a career out of it arent we going to get anything done around here in a minute phillip murmured smiling to himself when she turned the corner and disappeared sybill i sure hope you hang around st chris for a while she didnt know how long she would stay her time was her own she could work where she chose and for now shed chosen this little water town on marylands southern eastern shore nearly all of her life had been spent in cities initially because her parents had preferred them and then because she had new york boston chicago paris london milan she understood the urban landscape and its inhabitants the fact was dr sybill griffin had made a career out of the study of urban life shed gathered degrees in anthropology sociology and psychology along the way four years at harvard postgraduate work at oxford a doctorate from columbia shed thrived in academia and now six months before her thirtieth birthday she could write her own ticket which was precisely what shed chosen to do for a living write her first book urban landscape had been well received earned her critical acclaim and a modest income but her second familiar strangers had rocketed onto the national lists had taken her into the whirlwind of book tours lectures talk shows now that pbs was producing a documentary series based on her observations and theories of city life and customs she was much more than financially secure she was independent her publisher had been open to her idea of a book on the dynamics and traditions of small towns initially shed considered it merely a cover an excuse to travel to st christophers to spend time there on personal business but then shed begun to think it through it would make an interesting study after all she was a trained observer and skilled at documenting those observations work might save her nerves in any case she considered pacing her pretty little hotel suite certainly it would be easier and more productive to approach this entire trip as a kind of project she needed time objectivity and access to the subjects involved thanks to convenient circumstance it appeared she had all three now she stepped out onto the twofoot slab that the hotel loftily called a terrace it offered a stunning view of the chesapeake bay and intriguing glimpses of life on the waterfront already shed watched workboats chug into dock and unload tanks of the blue crabs the area was famous for shed watched the crab pickers at work the sweep of gulls the flight of egrets but she had yet to wander into any of the little shops she wasnt in st chris for souvenirs perhaps she would drag a table near the window and work with that view when the breeze was right she could catch snippets of voices a slower more fluid dialect than she heard on the streets of new york where shed based herself for the last few years not quite southern she thought such as you would hear in atlanta or mobile or charleston but a long way from the clipped tones and hard consonants of the north on some sunny afternoons she could sit on one of the little iron benches that dotted the waterfront and watch the little world that had formed here out of water and fish and human sweat she would see how a small community of people like this based on the bay and tourists interacted what traditions what habits what clichгs ran through them styles she mused of dress of movements of speech inhabitants so rarely realized how they conformed to unspoken rules of behavior dictated by place rules rules rules they existed everywhere sybill believed in them absolutely what rules did the quinns live by she wondered what type of glue had fashioned them into a family they would of course have their own codes their own shortspeak with a pecking order and a reward and discipline standard where and how would seth fit into it finding out discreetly was a priority there was no reason for the quinns to know who she was to suspect her connection it would be better for all parties if no one knew otherwise they could very well attempt and possibly succeed in blocking her from seth altogether hed been with them for months now she couldnt be sure what hed been told what spin they might have put on the circumstances she needed to observe to study to consider and to judge then she would act she would not be pressured she ordered herself she would not be made to feel guilty or responsible she would take her time after their meeting that afternoon she thought it would be ridiculously simple to get to know the quinns all she had to do was wander into that big brick building and show an interest in the process of creating a wooden sailboat phillip quinn would be her entree hed displayed all the typical behavioral patterns of earlystage attraction it wouldnt be a hardship to take advantage of that since he only spent a few days a week in st chris there was little danger of taking a casual flirtation into serious territory wrangling an invitation to his home here wouldnt present a problem she needed to see where and how seth was living who was in charge of his welfare was he happy gloria had said theyd stolen her son that theyd used their influence and their money to snatch him away but gloria was a liar sybill squeezed her eyes shut struggling to be calm to be objective not to be hurt yes gloria was a liar she thought again a user but she was also seths mother going to the desk sybill opened her filofax and slid the photograph out a little boy with strawcolored hair and bright blue eyes smiled out at her shed taken the picture herself the first and only time shed seen seth he must have been four she thought now phillip had said he was ten now and sybill remembered it had been six years since gloria showed up on her doorstep in new york with her son in tow shed been desperate of course broke furious weepy begging thered been no choice but to take her in not with the child staring up with those huge haunted eyes sybill hadnt known anything about children shed never been around them perhaps that was why shed fallen for seth so quickly and so hard and when shed come home three weeks later and found them gone along with all the cash in the house her jewelry and her prized collection of daum china shed been devastated she should have expected it she told herself now it had been classic gloria behavior but shed believed had needed to believe that they could finally connect that the child would make a difference that she could help well this time she thought as she tucked the photo away again she would be more careful less emotional she knew that gloria was telling at least part of the truth this time whatever she did from this point on would depend on her own judgment she would begin to judge when she saw her nephew again sitting she turned on her laptop and began to write her initial notes the quinn brothers appear to have an easy malepattern relationship from my single observation i would suspect they work together well it will take additional study to determine what function each provides in this business partnership and in their familial relations both cameron and ethan quinn are newly married it will be necessary to meet their wives to understand the dynamics of this family logically one of them will represent the mother figure since camerons wife anna spinelli quinn has a fulltime career one would suspect that grace monroe quinn fulfills this function however its a mistake to generalize such matters and this will require personal observations i found it telling that the business sign the quinns hung this afternoon contained seths name but as a quinn i cant say if this disposal of his legal name is for their benefit or his the boy must certainly be aware that the quinns are filing for custody i cant say as yet whether he has received any of the letters gloria has written him perhaps the quinns have disposed of them though i sympathize with her plight and her desperation to get her child back its best that she remain unaware that ive come here once ive documented my findings ill contact her if there is a legal battle in the future its best to approach the matter with facts rather than raw emotion hopefully the lawyer gloria has engaged will contact the quinns through the proper legal channels shortly for myself i hope to see seth tomorrow and gain some insight into the situation it would be helpful to determine how much he knows about his parentage as i have only recently become fully informed ive not yet completely assimilated all the facts and their repercussions we will soon see if small towns are indeed a hotbed of information on their inhabitants i intend to learn all i can learn about professor raymond quinn before im done chapter three contents prev next the typical venue for socializing information gathering and mating rituals small town or big city sybill observed was the local bar whether it was decorated with brass and ferns or peanut shells and tin ashtrays whether the music was whiny country or heartreeling rock it was the traditional spot for gathering and exchanging information shineys pub in st christophers certainly fit the bill the decor here was dark wood cheap chrome and faded posters of boats the music was loud she decided unable to fully identify the style booming out of the towering amps flanking the small stage where four young men pounded away at guitars and drums with more enthusiasm than talent a trio of men at the bar kept their eyes glued to the baseball game on the smallscreen tv bracketed to the wall behind the bar they seemed content to watch the silent ballet of pitcher and batter while they nursed brown bottles of beer and ate fistfuls of pretzels the dance floor was jammed there were only four couples but the limited space caused several incidents of elbow rapping and hip bumping no one seemed to mind the waitresses were decked out in foolish malefantasy outfitsвђshort black skirts tiny tight vneck blouses fishnet stockings and stiletto heels sybill felt instant sympathy she tucked herself into a wobbly table as far away from the amps as humanly possible the smoke and noise didnt bother her nor did the sticky floor or the jittery table her choice of seating afforded her the clearest view of the occupants shed been desperate to escape her hotel room for a couple of hours now she was set to sit back enjoy a glass of wine and observe the natives the waitress who approached was a petite brunette with an enviable bustline and a cheery smile hi what can i get you a glass of chardonnay and a side of ice coming right up she set a black plastic bowl filled with pretzels on the table and picked her way back to the bar taking orders as she went sybill wondered if shed just had her first encounter with ethans wife her information was that grace quinn worked at this bar but there had been no wedding ring on the little brunettes finger and sybill assumed that a new bride would certainly wear one the other waitress that one looked dangerous she decided blond built and brooding she was certainly attractive in an obvious way still nothing about her shouted newlywed either particularly the way she leaned over an appreciative customers table to give him the full benefit of her cleavage sybill frowned and nibbled on a pretzel if that was grace quinn she would definitely be scratched from motherfigure status something happened in the ball game sybill assumed as the three men began to shout cheering on someone named eddie out of habit she took out her notebook and began to record observations the backslapping and arm punching of male companions the body language of the females leaning in for intimacy the hair flipping the eye shifting hand gesturing and of course the mating ritual of the contemporary couple through the dance that was how phillip saw her when he came in she was smiling to herself her gaze roaming her hand scribbling she looked he thought very cool very remote she might have been behind a thin sheet of oneway glass shed pulled her hair back so that it lay in a sleek tail on her neck and left her face unframed gold drops studded with single colored stones swung at her ears he watched her put her pen down to shrug out of a suede jacket of pale yellow he had driven in on impulse giving in to restlessness now he blessed that vaguely dissatisfied mood that had dogged him all evening she was he decided exactly what hed been looking for sybill right he saw the quick surprise flicker in her eyes when she glanced up and he saw that those eyes were as clear and pure as lake water thats right recovering she closed her notebook and smiled phillip of boats by quinn you here alone yesвђ unless youd like to sit down and have a drink id love to he pulled out a chair nodding toward her notebook did i interrupt you not really she shifted her smile to the waitress when her wine was served hey phil want a draft marsha you read my mind marsha sybill thought that eliminated the perky brunette its unusual music the music here consistently sucks he flashed a smile quick charming and amused its a tradition heres to tradition then she lifted her glass sipped then with a little hmmm began transferring ice into the wine how would you rate the wine well its basic elemental primitive she sipped again smiled winningly it sucks thats also a proud shineys tradition hes got sam adams on draft its a better bet ill remember that lips curved she tilted her head since you know the local traditions i take it youve lived here for some time yeah his eyes narrowed as he studied her as something pushed at the edges of his memory i know you her heart bounded hard into her throat taking her time she picked up her glass again her hand remained steady her voice even and easy i dont think so no i do i know that face it didnt click before when you were wearing sunglasses something aboutвђ he reached out put a hand under her chin and angled her head again that look right there his fingertips were just a bit rough his touch very confident and firm the gesture itself warned her that this was a man used to touching women and she was a woman unused to being touched in defense sybill arched an eyebrow a woman with a cynical bent would suspect thats a line and not a very original one i dont use lines he murmured concentrating on her face except originals im good with images and ive seen that one clear intelligent eyes slightly amused smile sybillвђ his gaze skimmed over her face then his lips curved slowly griffin doctor sybill griffin familiar strangers she let out the breath that had clogged in her lungs her success was still very new and having her face recognized continued to surprise her and in this case relieve her there was no connection between dr griffin and seth delauter you are good she said lightly so did you read the book or just look at my picture on the dust jacket i read it fascinating stuff in fact i liked it enough to go out and buy your first one havent read it yet though im flattered youre good thanks marsha he added when she set his beer in front of him yall just holler if you need anything marsha winked holler loud this bands breaking sound records tonight which gave him an excuse to edge his chair closer and lean in her scent was subtle he noted a man had to get very close to catch its message tell me dr griffin whats a renowned urbanite doing in an unapologetically rural water town like st chris research behavioral patterns and traditions she said lifting her glass in a half toast of small towns and rural communities quite a change of pace for you sociology and cultural interest arent and shouldnt be limited to cities taking notes a few the local tavern she began more comfortable now the regulars the trio at the bar obsessed with the ritual of maledominated sports to the exclusion of the noise and activities around them they could be home kicked back in their barcaloungers but they prefer the bonding experience of passive participation in the event in this way they have companionship partners with whom to share the interest who will either argue or agree it doesnt matter which its the pattern that matters he found he enjoyed the way her voice took on a lecturing tone that brought out brisk yankee the os are in a hot pennant race and youre deep in orioles territory maybe its the game the game is the vehicle the pattern would remain fairly constant whether the vehicle was football or basketball she shrugged the typical male gains more enjoyment from sports if he has at least one likeminded male companion with him you have only to observe commercials aimed primarily at the male consumer beer for instance she said tapping a finger on his glass its quite often sold by showcasing a group of attractive men sharing some common experience a man then buys that brand of beer because hes been programmed to believe that it will enhance his standing with his peer group because he was grinning she lifted her eyebrows you disagree not at all im in advertising and that pretty much hit the nail advertising she ignored the little tug of guilt at the pretense i wouldnt think there would be much call for that here i work in baltimore im back here on weekends for a while a family thing long story id like to hear it later there was something he thought about those nearly translucent blue eyes framed by long inky lashes that made it nearly impossible to look anywhere else tell me what else you see wellвђ it was a fine skill she decided a masterwork the way he could look at a woman as if she were the most vital thing in the world at that one moment it made her heart bump pleasantly you see the other waitress phillip glanced over watched the frivolous bow on the back of the womans skirt swivel as she walked to the bar hard to miss her yes she fulfills certain primitive and typical malefantasy requirements but im referring to personality not physicality okay phillip ran his tongue around his teeth what do you see shes efficient but shes already calculating the time until closing she knows how to size up the better tippers and play to them she all but ignores the table of college students there they wont add much to her bill youd see the same survival techniques from an experienced and cynical waitress in a new york bar linda brewster phillip supplied recently divorced on the prowl for a new improved husband her family owns the pizza place so shes been waitressing off and on for years doesnt care for it do you want to dance what then thats not grace either she thought and struggled to tune back in im sorry the bands slowed it down if they havent turned it down would you like to dance all right she let him take her hand to lead her through the tables to the dance floor where they shoehorned themselves into the crowd i think this is supposed to be a version of angie phillip murmured if mick and the boys heard what theyre doing to it theyd shoot the entire band on sight you like the stones whats not to like since they could do no more than sway she tilted her head back to look at him it wasnt a hardship to find his face so close to hers or to be forced to press her body firmly to his downanddirty rock and roll no frills no fuss all sex you like sex she had to laugh whats not to like and though i appreciate the thought i dont intend to have any tonight theres always tomorrow there certainly is she considered kissing him letting him kiss her as an experiment that would certainly include an aspect of enjoyment instead she turned her head so cheeks brushed he was entirely too attractive for an impulsive and uncalculated risk better safe she reminded herself than stupid why dont i take you to dinner tomorrow skillfully he slid a hand up her spine back down to her waist theres a nice place right in town terrific view of the bay best seafood on the shore we can have a conversation in normal tones and you can tell me the story of your life his lips had brushed her ear sending a shocking ripple of reaction down to her toes she should have known she thought that anyone who looked like he did would be damn good at sexual maneuvers ill think about it she murmured and deciding to give as good as she got skimmed her fingertips over the back of his neck and let you know when the song ended and the next picked up on a blast of sound and speed she eased away i have to go what he leaned down so she could shout in his ear i have to go thanks for the dance ill walk you out back at the table he pulled out some bills while she gathered her things the first step outside into the cool and quiet air made her laugh well that was an experience thank you for adding to it i wouldnt have missed it its not very late he added taking her hand late enough she pulled out the keys to her car come by the boatyard tomorrow ill show you around i might just do that good night phillip sybill he didnt bother to resist simply brought her hand to his lips over their joined fingers his eyes locked with hers im glad you picked st chris so am i she slipped into her car relieved that she had to concentrate on the task of switching on the lights releasing the brake starting the engine driving wasnt second nature to a woman who had depended on public transportation or private car services most of her life she focused on reversing on putting the car in drive to make the turn onto the road and she firmly ignored the faint echo of pressure on her knuckles where his lips had touched but she didnt quite resist glancing in the rearview mirror and taking one last look at him before she drove away phillip decided that going back into shineys would be absurdly anticlimactic he thought about her as he drove home the way her eyebrows arched when she made a point or enjoyed a comment that subtle and intimate scent she wore that told a man that if hed gotten close enough to catch a whiff maybe just maybe hed have a chance to get closer he told himself she was the perfect woman for him to invest some time in getting closer to she was beautiful she was smart she was cultured and sophisticated and just sexy enough to make his hormones stand at attention he liked women and missed having time for conversations with them not that he didnt enjoy talking with anna and grace but lets face it it wasnt quite the same as talking with a woman when you could also fantasize about taking her to bed and hed been missing that particular area of malefemale relationships just lately he rarely had time to do more than stumble into his apartment after a ten or twelvehour workday his once interesting and varied social calendar had taken some large hits since seth had come to the family the week was dedicated to his accounts and consultations with the lawyer the fight with the insurance company on payment of his fathers death benefits was coming to a head the resolution of permanent guardianship of seth would be decided within ninety days the responsibility of dealing with the mountain of paperwork and phone calls that sprang from those actions was his details were his strong point weekends were consumed by household duties the business and whatever had slipped through the cracks during the week when you added it all up he mused it didnt leave much time for cozy dinners with attractive women much less the ritual of slipping between the sheets with those women which explained his recent restlessness and moodiness he supposed when a mans sex life virtually vanished he was bound to get a little edgy the house was dark but for the single beam of the porch light when he pulled into the drive barely midnight on friday night he thought with a sigh how the mighty have fallen there would have been a time when he and his brothers would have been out cruising looking for action well he and cam would have dragged ethan along but once theyd hounded him into it ethan would have held up his end the quinn boys hadnt spent many friday nights snoozing these days he thought as he climbed out of the jeep cam would be upstairs cozied up to his wife and ethan would be tucked into graces little house undoubtedly they both had smiles on their faces lucky bastards knowing he wouldnt be able to sleep he skirted the house and walked to where the edge of the trees met the edge of the water the moon was a fat ball riding the night sky it shed its soft white light over the dark water wet eelgrass and thick leaves cicadas were singing in their high monotonous voices and deep in those thick woods an owl called out in tireless twotoned notes perhaps he preferred the sounds of the city voices and traffic muffled through glass but he never failed to find this spot appealing though he missed the citys pace the theater and museums the eclectic mix of food and people he could appreciate the peace and the stability found right here day after day year after year without it he had no doubt he would have found his way back to the gutter and died there you always wanted more for yourself than that the chill washed through him from gut to fingertips where he had been standing staring out at the moonlight showering through the trees he was now staring at his father the father hed buried six months before i only had one beer he heard himself say youre not drunk son ray stepped forward so that the moonlight shimmered over his dramatic mane of silver hair and into the brilliant blue eyes that were bright with humor youre going to want to breathe now before you pass out phillip let out his breath in a whoosh but his ears continued to ring im going to sit down now he did slowly like a creaky old man easing himself down onto the grass i dont believe in ghosts he said to the water or reincarnation the afterlife visitations or any form of psychic phenomenon you always were the most pragmatic of the lot nothing was real unless you could see it touch it smell it ray sat beside him with a contented sigh and stretched out long legs clad in frayed jeans he crossed his ankles and on his feet were the wellworn docksides that phillip himself had packed into a box for the salvation army nearly six months before well ray said cheerfully youre seeing me arent you no im having an episode most likely resulting from sexual deprivation and overwork i wont argue with you its too pretty a night i havent reached closure yet phillip said to himself im still angry over the way he died and why and all the unanswered questions so im projecting i figured youd be the toughest nut of the three always had an answer for everything i know youve got questions too and i know youve got anger youre entitled youve had to change your life and take on responsibilities that shouldnt have been yours but you did it and im grateful i dont have time for therapy right now theres no place on the schedule to fit sessions in ray let out a hoot of laughter boy youre not drunk and youre not crazy either youre just stubborn why dont you use that flexible mind of yours phillip and consider a possibility bracing himself phillip turned his head it was his fathers face wide and lined with life and filled with humor those brightblue eyes were dancing the silver hair ruffling in the night air this is an impossibility some people said when your mother and i took you and your brothers in that it was an impossibility wed make a family make a difference they were wrong if wed listened to them if wed gone by logic none of you would have been ours but fate doesnt give a horses ass about logic it just is and you were meant to be ours okay phillip shot out a hand and jerked it back in shock how could i do that how could i touch you if youre a ghost because you need to casually ray gave phillips shoulder a quick pat im here for the next little while phillips throat filled even as his stomach tightened into knots why i didnt finish i left it up to you and your brothers im sorry for that phillip it wasnt happening of course phillip told himself he was probably in the first stages of a minor breakdown he could feel the air against his face warm and moist the cicadas were still shrilling the owl still hooting if he was having an episode he thought again it seemed only right to play it out theyre trying to say it was suicide he said slowly the insurance companys fighting the claim i hope you know thats bullshit i was careless distracted i had an accident there was an edge to rays voice now an impatience and annoyance that phillip recognized i wouldnt have taken the easy way and i had the boy to think about is seth your son i can tell you that he belongs to me both his head and his heart ached as he turned to stare out at the water again mom was still alive when he was conceived i know that i was never unfaithful to your mother then howвђ you need to accept him for himself i know you care for him i know youre doing your best by him you have that last step to take acceptance he needs you all of you nothings going to happen to him phillip said grimly well see to that hell change your life if you let him phillip let out a short laugh believe me he already has in a way that will make your life better dont close yourself off to those possibilities and dont worry too much about this little visit ray patted him companionably on the knee talk to your brothers yeah like im going to tell them i sat outside in the middle of the night and talked toвђ he looked over saw nothing but the moonlight on the trees nobody he finished and wearily laid down on the grass to stare up at the moon god i need a vacation chapter four contents prev next it wouldnt do to appear too anxious sybill reminded herself or to get there too early it had to be casual she had to be relaxed she decided not to take her car it would look more like a careless visit if she walked down from the waterfront and if she included the visit to the boatyard in an afternoon of shopping and wandering it would appear more impulsive than calculated to calm herself she roamed the waterfront a pretty indiansummer saturday morning drew tourists they poked and strolled along as she did dropping into the little shops pausing to watch boats sail or motor on the bay no one seemed to be in a particular hurry or have a specific destination that in itself she mused made an interesting contrast to the usual urban saturday when even the tourists seemed to be in a rush to get from one place to the next it would be something to consider and analyze and perhaps theorize over in her book and because she did find it interesting she slipped her mini recorder out of her bag and murmured a few verbal notes and observations families appear to be relaxed rather than harried or desperately seeking the entertainment theyve traveled to find the natives seem to be friendly and patient life is slow to reflect the pace set by the people who make their living here the little shops werent doing what shed term a bustling business yet the merchants didnt have that anxious and slyeyed look prevalent among the vendors where the crowds were thick and the wallets tightly guarded she bought a few postcards for friends and associates in new york then more out of habit than need selected a book on the history of the area it would help her in her research she imagined she lingered over a pewter fairy with a teardrop crystal hanging from her elegant fingers but she resisted it firmly reminding herself that she could purchase any sort of foolishness she wanted in new york crawfords appeared to be a popular spot so she strolled in and treated herself to an ice cream cone it gave her something to do with her hands as she walked the few blocks to boats by quinn she appreciated the value of props everyone used them in the continuing play of living she thought a glass at a cocktail party a paperback book on the subway jewelry she realized when she caught herself twisting her necklace around her nervous fingers she dropped the chain and concentrated on enjoying her scoop of raspberry sherbet it didnt take long to walk to the outskirts of town she calculated that the waterfront area ran for barely a mile from end to end the neighborhoods ran west from the water narrow streets with tidy houses and tiny lawns low fences designed as much for backyard gossiping she mused as for boundary lines trees were large and leafy still holding the deep dark green of summer it would be she thought an attractive sight when they turned with autumn kids played in yards or rode bikes along the sloping sidewalks she saw a teenage boy lovingly waxing an old chevy compact singing in a loud justoutoftune voice to whatever played through his headphones a longlegged mutt with floppy ears rushed a fence as she passed barking in deep rusty clips her heart did a quick dance when he planted his huge paws on the top of the fence and she kept walking she didnt know much about dogs she spotted phillips jeep in the potholefilled parking lot beside the boatyard an aging pickup truck kept it company the doors and several of the windows of the building were wide open through them came the buzz of saws and the southern rock beat of john fogerty okay sybill she thought and took a deep breath as she carefully swallowed the last of her cone now or never she stepped inside and found herself momentarily distracted by the look of the place it was huge and dusty and bright as a spotlighted stage the quinns were hard at work with ethan and cam fitting a long bent plank into place on what she assumed was a hull in progress phillip stood at a big dangerouslooking power saw running lumber through it she didnt see seth for a moment she simply watched and wondered if she should slip back out again if her nephew wasnt there it would be more sensible to postpone the visit until she was sure he was he might be away for the day with friends did he have any friends or he could be home did he consider it his home before she could decide the saw switched off leaving only john fogerty crooning about a browneyed handsome man phillip stepped back pushed up his safety goggles turned and saw her his smile of welcome came so quickly so sincerely that she had to clamp down on a hard tug of guilt im interrupting she raised her voice to compete with the music thank god dusting his hands on his jeans phillip started toward her ive been stuck with looking at these guys all day youre a big improvement i decided to play tourist she jiggled the shopping bag she carried and i thought id take you up on the offer of a tour i was hoping you would soвђ deliberately she shifted her gaze to the hull it was safer she decided than looking into those tawny eyes for any length of time thats a boat its a hull or will be he took her hand drew her forward its going to be a sports fisher which is one of those fancy boats men like to go out on to act manly fish for marlin and drink beer hey sybill cam shot her a grin want a job she looked at the tools the sharp edges the heavy lumber i dont think so it was easy to smile back to look over at ethan it looks like the three of you know what youre doing we know what were doing cam wiggled his thumb between himself and ethan we keep phillip around for entertainment im not appreciated around here she laughed and began to circle the hull she could understand the basic shape but not the process i assume this is upside down good eye phillip only grinned when she cocked an eyebrow after shes planked well turn her and start on the decking are your parents boatbuilders no my mother was a doctor my father a college professor but we grew up around boats she heard it in his voice the affection the notquitesettled grief and hated herself shed intended to ask him more about his parents in some detail but couldnt ive never been on a boat ever i imagine there are several million people in the world who havent want to maybe ive enjoyed watching the boats from my hotel window as she studied it the hull became a puzzle she needed to solve how do you know where to begin to build this i assume you work from a design blueprints or schematics or whatever you call it ethans been doing the bulk of the design work cam fiddles with it seth draws it up seth her fingers tightened on the strap of her purse props she thought again didnt you say he was in middle school thats right the kids got a real talent for drawing check these out now she heard pride and it flustered her struggling for composure she followed him to a far wall where drawings of boats were roughly framed in raw wood they were goodвђvery very good clever sketches done with pencil and care and talent heвђ a young boy drew these yes pretty great huh this is the one we just finished he tapped a hand on the glass and this ones what were working on now hes very talented she murmured around the lump in her throat he has excellent perspective do you draw a little now and then just a hobby she had to turn away to settle herself it relaxes me and it helps in my work determined to smile again she tossed her hair over her shoulder and aimed a bright easy one at phillip so wheres the artist today oh hesвђ he broke off as two dogs raced into the building sybill took an instinctive step back as the smaller of the two made a beeline in her direction she made some strangled sound of distress just as phillip jabbed out a finger and issued a sharp command hold it you idiot no jumping no jumping he repeated but foolishs forward motion proved too much for all of them he was already up already had his paws planted just under sybills breasts she staggered a bit seeing only big sharp teeth bared in what she took for fierceness rather than a sloppy doggie grin nice dog she managed in a stutter good dog stupid dog phillip corrected and hauled foolish down by the collar no manners sit sorry he said to sybill when the dog obligingly plopped down and offered his paw hes foolish well hes enthusiastic no foolish is his nameвђand his personality hell stay like that until you shake his paw oh hmm gingerly she took the paw with two fingers he wont bite phillip angled his head noting there was a good deal more distress than irritation in her eyes sorryвђare you afraid of dogs iвђ maybe a littleвђof large strange dogs hes strange all right the other ones simon and hes considerably more polite phillip scratched simons ears as the dog sat calmly studying sybill hes ethans the idiot belongs to seth i see seth had a dog was all she could think as foolish offered his paw yet again eyeing her with what appeared abject adoration i dont know very much about dogs im afraid these are chesapeake bay retrieversвђor foolish mostly is were not sure what else he is seth call off your dog before he slobbers all over the ladys shoes sybill lifted her head quickly and saw the boy just inside the doorway the sun was streaming at his back and it cast his face into shadows she saw only a tall slightly built boy carrying a large brown bag and wearing a blackandorange ball cap he doesnt slobber much hey foolish instantly both dogs scrambled to their feet and raced across the room seth waded through them carrying the bag to a makeshift table fashioned from a sheet of plywood laid over two sawhorses i dont know why i have to always go up for lunch and stuff he complained because were bigger than you cam told him and dived into the bag you get me the coldcut sub loaded yeah yeah wheres my change seth pulled a liter of pepsi out of the bag cracked the top and guzzled straight from the bottle then he grinned what change look you little thief ive got at least two bucks coming back dont know what youre talking about you mustve forgotten to add on the carrying charges again cam made a grab for him and seth danced agilely away hooting with laughter brotherly love phillip said easily thats why i make sure i only give the kid the right change you never see a nickel back otherwise want some lunch no iвђ she couldnt take her eyes off seth knew she had to he was talking with ethan now making wide exaggerated gestures with his free hand while his dog took quick playful leaps at his fingers i had something already but you go ahead a drink then did you get my water kid yeah fancy water waste of money man crawfords was packed crawfords with a sensation she couldnt quite define sybill realized they might have been in the store at the same time might have walked right by each other she would have passed him on the street without a clue seth glanced from phillip to sybill studied her with mild interest you buying a boat no he didnt recognize her she thought of course he wouldnt hed been hardly more than a baby the only time theyd seen each other there was no stunned familial awareness in his eyes any more than there would have been in hers but she knew im just looking around thats cool he went back to the bag and pulled out his own sandwich ahвђ talk to him she ordered herself say something anything phillip was just showing me your drawings theyre wonderful theyre okay he jerked a shoulder but she thought she saw a faint flush of pleasure on his cheeks i could do better but theyre always rushing me casuallyвђshe hoped it was casuallyвђshe crossed to him she could see him clearly now his eyes were blue but a deeper darker blue than hers or her sisters his hair was a darker blond than the little boys in the picture she carried hed been nearly a towhead at four and now his hair was a richer blond and very straight the mouth she thought wasnt there some resemblance around the mouth and chin is that what you want to be she needed to keep him talking an artist maybe but thats mostly for kicks he took a huge bite of his sandwich then talked through it were boatbuilders his hands were far from clean she noted and his face wasnt much better she imagined such niceties as washing up before meals went by the wayside in a household of males maybe youll go into design work seth this is dr sybill griffin phillip offered sybill a plastic cup of bubbling water over ice she writes books like stories not exactly she told him like observations right now im spending some time in the area observing he wiped his mouth with a swipe from the back of his hand the hand foolish had enthusiastically licked before and after sybill noted with an inward wince you going to do a book about boats he asked her no about people people who live in small towns and right now people who live in small towns by the water how do you like itвђliving here i mean i like it okay living in the city sucks he picked up the soft drink bottle glugged again people who live there are nuts he grinned like phil youre a peasant seth i worry about you with a snort seth bit into his sandwich again im going out on the dock we got some ducks hanging out he bounced out dogs trailing behind him seths got very definite opinions phillip said dryly i guess the worlds pretty black and white when youre ten he doesnt care for the urban experience nerves she noted had been drowned out by sheer curiosity has he spent time with you in baltimore no he lived there for a while with his mother his tone had darkened making sybill raise an eyebrow part of that long story i mentioned i believe i mentioned id enjoy hearing it then have dinner with me tonight and well exchange those life stories she looked toward the cargo doors seth had gone out through them very much at home she needed to spend more time with him observing and she decided she needed to hear what the quinns had to say about the situation why not start with phillip all right id like that ill pick you up at seven she shook her head he seemed perfectly safe perfectly fine but she knew better than to take chances no ill meet you there wheres the restaurant ill write it down for you we can start the tour in my office it was easy enough and she had to admit it was interesting the tour itself didnt take long other than the huge work area there was little to the boatyardвђjust phillips closetsize office a small bathroom and a dark dingy storeroom it was obvious even to the untrained eye that the work center of the operation was its heart and soul it was ethan who patiently instructed her on smoothlap planking about waterlines and bow shapes she thought he would have made an excellent teacher with his clear simple phrasing and willingness to answer what must have been very basic questions she watched genuinely fascinated as the men held timber in a box and pumped out steam until the plank bowed into the shape they desired cam demonstrated how the ends were rabbeted together to form the smooth joints watching cam with seth she was forced to admit there was a definite bond between them if she had come across them knowing nothing she would have assumed they were brothers or perhaps father and son it was all in the attitude she decided then again they had an audience she mused and were likely on their best behavior she would see how they acted once they became used to her cam let out a long low whistle when sybill left the building he wiggled his eyebrows meaningfully at phillip very nice bro very nice indeed phillip flashed a grin then lifted his bottle of water to his lips cant complain she going to be around long enough to ahвђ if theres a god seth laid a plank down by the saw let out a huff shit you mean youre going to start poking at her is that all you guys think about other than pounding on you phillip whipped off seths hat and bopped the boy over the head with it sure what else you guys are always getting married seth said in disgust and tried to grab his hat i dont want to marry her i just want to have a nice civilized dinner with her then bounce on her seth finished christ he gets that from you phillip accused cam he came that way cam wrapped an arm around seths neck didnt you brat the panic didnt come now as it used to whenever seth was touched or held instead he wriggled and grinned at least i think of something besides girls all the time you guys are really lame lame phillip put seths hat on his own head to free his hands then rubbed them together lets toss this runt fish off the dock can you do that later ethan asked while seth shouted in wild and delighted objection or do i have to build this damn boat by myself later then phillip leaned down until he and seth were nose to nose and you wont know when you wont know where you wont know why man im shaking now i saw seth today at her laptop sybill gnawed her bottom lip then deleted the first sentence shed typed i made contact with the subject this afternoon better she decided more objective to approach this situation properly it would be best if she thought of seth as the subject there was no recognition on either side this is of course as expected he appears to be healthy hes attractive slimly built yet sturdy gloria was always thin so i suspect hes inherited her basic body type hes blond as she isвђor was when i last saw her he seemed to be comfortable with me im aware that some children are shy around strangers that doesnt appear to be the case here though he was not at the boatyard when i arrived he came in shortly after hed been sent to the store for lunch from the ensuing complaints and conversation i can assume he is often expected to run errands this could be construed two ways one that the quinns take advantage of having a young boy available and use him accordingly or two that they are instilling a sense of responsibility the truth likely resides in the middle he has a dog i believe this to be a usual even traditional occurrence for a child living in suburban or rural areas he also has a talent for drawing i was somewhat taken by surprise by this i have some talent for it myself as does my mother gloria however never showed any skill or interest in art this shared interest may be a way to develop a rapport with the boy it will be necessary to have some time alone with him to assist me in choosing the correct course to take the subject is in my opinion comfortable with the quinns he seems to be content and secure there is however a certain roughness a mild crudeness in him several times during the hour or so i spent with him i heard him swear once or twice he was rather absently corrected otherwise his language was ignored he was not required to wash his hands before eating nor did any of the quinns correct him for speaking with his mouth full or for feeding the dogs bits of his lunch his manners are by no means appalling but they are far from strictly polite he mentioned preferring living here to the city in fact he was most disdainful of urban life i have agreed to have dinner with phillip quinn tonight and will urge him to tell me the facts of how seth came to be with the quinns how those facts agree with and differ from the facts i received from gloria will help me assimilate the situation the next step will be to obtain an invitation to the quinn house im very interested to see where the boy is living to see him and the quinns on this stage and to meet the women who are now a part of his foster family i hesitate to contact social services and identify myself until i have completed this personal study sybill sat back tapping her fingers on the desk as she skimmed over her notes it was so little really she thought and her own fault shed thought she was prepared for that first meeting but she wasnt seeing him had left her drymouthed and sad the boy was her nephew her family yet they were strangers and wasnt that nearly as much her fault as it was glorias had she ever really tried to make a connection to bring him into her life true she had rarely known where he was but had she ever gone out of her way to find him or her sister the few times gloria had contacted her over the years for money always for money she had asked about seth but hadnt she simply taken glorias word that the child was fine had she ever demanded to speak with him to see him hadnt it simply been easier for her to send money over the wire and forget about them again easier she admitted because the one time she had let him in the one time she had let herself open her home and her heart hed been taken away and she had suffered this time she would do something she would do whatever was right whatever was best she wouldnt allow herself to become too emotionally involved however after all he wasnt her child if gloria retained custody he would still move out of her life again but she would make the effort take the time see that he was situated well then she would get on with her life and her work satisfied she saved the document and shifted to another to continue her notes for her book before she could begin the phone on her desk rang yes dr griffin sybill it took me a great deal of time and trouble to track you down mother on a long sigh sybill closed her eyes hello would you mind telling me what youre doing not at all im researching a new book how are you hows father please dont insult my intelligence i thought wed agreed you would stay out of this sordid little affair no as it always did when faced with a family confrontation sybills stomach pitched we agreed that you would prefer i stay out of it i decided i prefer not to ive seen seth im not interested in gloria or her son i am im sorry that upsets you can you expect it to do otherwise your sister has chosen her own life and is no longer a part of mine i will not be dragged into this i have no intention of dragging you into this resigned sybill reached into her purse and found the small cloisonnг box she used to store aspirin no one knows who i am and even if im connected to dr and mrs walter griffin that hardly follows to gloria and seth delauter it can be followed if anyone becomes interested enough to pursue it you cant accomplish anything by staying there and interfering in this situation sybill i want you to leave go back to new york or come here to paris perhaps youll listen to your father if not to me sybill washed down the aspirin with water then dug out antacids im going to see this through im sorry there was a long silence ripe with temper and frustration sybill closed her eyes left them closed and waited you were always a joy to me i never expected this kind of betrayal i very much regret that i spoke with you about this matter i wouldnt have if id known you would react so outrageously hes a tenyearold boy mother hes your grandson he is nothing to me or to you if you continue this gloria will make you pay for what you see as kindness i can handle gloria there was a laugh now short and brittle as glass so you always believed and you were always wrong please dont contact me or your father about any of this ill expect to hear from you when youve come to your senses motherвђ the dial tone made sybill wince barbara griffin was a master at having the last word very carefully sybill set the receiver on the hook very deliberately she swallowed the antacid then very defiantly she turned back to her screen and buried herself in work chapter five contents prev next since sybill was always on time and nearly everyone else in the world as far as she was concerned never was she was surprised to find phillip already sitting at the table hed reserved for dinner he rose offered her a killer smile and a single yellow rose both charmed her and made her suspicious thank you my pleasure sincerely you look wonderful shed gone to some trouble in that area but more for herself than for him the call from her mother had left her miserably depressed and guilty shed tried to fight off both emotions by taking a great deal of time and putting a great deal of effort into her appearance the simple black dress with its square neck and long snug sleeves was one of her favorites the single strand of pearls was a legacy from her paternal grandmother and much loved shed swept her hair up in a smooth twist and added sapphire cabochon earrings that shed bought in london years before she knew it was the sort of feminine armor that women slipped into for confidence and power shed wanted both thank you again she slid into the booth across from him and sniffed the rose and so do you i know the wine list here he told her trust me on wine why not good he glanced toward the server well have a bottle of the number she laid the rose beside the leatherbound menu which is a very nice pouilly fuisse i remember from shineys that you like white i think youll find this a few very important steps up from what you had there almost anything would be he cocked his head took her hand somethings wrong no deliberately she curved her lips what could be wrong its just as advertised she turned her head to look out the window beside her where the bay stretched dark blue and excitingly choppy under a sky going rosy with sunset a lovely view a pretty spot she turned back an interesting companion for the evening no he thought watching her eyes something was just a little off on impulse he slid over cupped her chin in his hand and laid his lips lightly on hers she didnt draw away but allowed herself to experience the kiss was easy smooth skilled and very soothing when he drew back she raised an eyebrow and that was because you looked like you needed it she didnt sigh but she wanted to instead she put her hands in her lap thank you once again any time in factвђ his fingers tightened just a little on her face and this time the kiss moved a bit deeper lasted a bit longer her lips parted under his before she realized that shed meant it to happen her breath caught released and her pulse shivered as his teeth scraped lightly as his tongue teased hers into a slow seductive dance her fingers were linked and gripped tight her mind just beginning to blur when he eased away and that was because she managed i guess i needed it his lips brushed over hers once then again before she found the presence of mind to lay a hand on his chest a hand she realized that wanted to ball into a fist on that soft shirt and hold him in place rather than nudge him away but she nudged him away it was simply a matter of handling him she reminded herself of staying in control i think as appetizers go that was very appealing but we should order tell me whats wrong he wanted to know he realized wanted to help wanted to smooth those shadows out of her incredibly clear eyes and make them smile he hadnt expected to develop a taste for her so quickly its nothing of course it is and there cant be anything much more therapeutic than dumping on a relative stranger youre right she opened her menu but most relative strangers arent particularly interested is someone elses minor problems im interested in you she smiled as she shifted her gaze from the entrees to his face youre attracted to me thats not always the same thing i think im both he took her hand held it as the wine was brought to the table as the label was turned for his approval he waited while a sample was poured into his glass watching her in that steady allelseaside way shed discovered he had he lifted it sipped still looking at her its perfect youll like it he murmured to her while their glasses were being filled youre right she told him after she sipped i like it very much shall i tell you tonights specials their waiter began in a cheerful voice while he recited they sat hands linked eyes locked sybill decided she heard about every third word and didnt really give a damn he had the most incredible eyes like old gold like something shed seen in a painting in rome ill have the mixed salad with the vinaigrette and the fish of the day grilled he kept watching her his lips curving slowly as he drew her hand across the table to kiss her palm the same and take your time im very attracted he said to sybill as the waiter rolled his eyes and walked away and im very interested talk to me all right what harm could it do she decided since sooner or later they would have to deal with each other on a different sort of level it might be helpful if they understood one another now im the good daughter amused at herself she smiled a little obedient respectful polite academically skilled professionally successful its a burden yes it can be of course i know better intellectually than to allow myself to be ruled by parental expectations at this stage of my life but phillip said giving her fingers a squeeze you are we all are are you he thought of sitting by the water in the moonlight and having a conversation with his dead father more than i might have believed in my case my parents didnt give me life they gave me the life this life in yours he considered since youre the good daughter is there a bad daughter my sister has always been difficult certainly shes been a disappointment to my parents and the more disappointed theyve become in her the more they expect from me youre supposed to be perfect exactly and i cant be wanted to be tried to be couldnt be which of course equaled failure how could it be otherwise she mused perfect is boring phillip commented and intimidating why try to be either so what happened he asked when she only frowned its nothing really my mother is angry with me just now if i give in and do what she wantsвђ well i cant i just cant so you feel guilty and sad and sorry and afraid that nothing will ever be the same between us again as bad as that it could be sybill murmured im grateful for all the opportunities they gave me the structure the education we traveled quite a bit so i saw a great deal of the world of different cultures while i was still a child its been invaluable in my work opportunities phillip thought structure education and travel nowhere had she listed love affection fun he wondered if she realized shed described a school more than a family where did you grow up urn here and there new york boston chicago paris milan london my father lectured and held consultations hes a psychiatrist they live in paris now it was always my mothers favorite city longdistance guilt it made her laugh yes she sat back as their salads were served oddly enough she did feel a little better it seemed slightly less deceptive to have told him something about herself and you grew up here i came here when i was thirteen when the quinns became my parents became its part of that long story he lifted his wineglass studying her over its rim normally if he brought up that period of his life with a woman what he told was a carefully edited version not a lie but a lessthandetailed account of his life before the quinns oddly enough he was tempted to tell sybill the whole the ugly and unvarnished truth he hesitated then settled on something between the two i grew up in baltimore on the rough side i got into trouble pretty serious trouble by the time i was thirteen i was headed for worse the quinns gave me a chance to change that they took me in brought me to st chris became my family they adopted you shed had that much information from researching everything she could find on raymond quinn but it didnt give her the why yeah they already had cam and ethan and they made room for one more i didnt make it easy for them initially but they stuck with me i never knew either of them to back off from a problem he thought of his father broken and dying in a hospital bed even then rays concerns had been for his sons for seth for family when i first saw you sybill began the three of you i knew you were brothers no real physical resemblance but something less tangible id say youre an example of how environment can offset heredity more an example of what two generous and determined people can do for three lost boys she sipped her wine to soothe her throat before she spoke and seth lost boy number four were trying to do for him what my parents would have done what our father asked us to do my mother died several years ago it left the four of us floundering some she was an incredible woman we couldnt have appreciated her enough when we had her i think you did and moved by the sound of his voice she smiled at him im sure she felt very loved i hope so after we lost her cam took off for europe racingвђboats cars whatever he did pretty well at it ethan stayed bought his own house but hes locked into the bay i moved back to baltimore once an urbanite he added with a quick smile the inner harbor camden yards exactly i came down here off and on holidays the occasional weekend but its not the same curious she tilted her head would you want it to be she remembered her secret thrill when shed gone off to college to be on her own not to have every movement and word weighed and judged freedom no but there were times are times i miss the way it was dont you ever think back to some perfect summer youre sixteen your drivers license is shiny and new in your wallet and the world is all yours she laughed but shook her head she hadnt had a drivers license at sixteen theyd been living in london that year as she recalled there had been a uniformed driver to take her where shed been allowed to go unless she managed to slip out and ride the tube that had been her small rebellion sixteenyearold boys she said while their salad plates were removed their entrees served are more emotionally attached to their cars than sixteenyearold girls are its easier for that boy to get himself a girl if he has wheels i doubt you had any trouble in that area with or without a car its tough to neck in the backseat until youve got one true enough and now youre back here and so are your brothers yeah my father had seth through complicated and not entirely clear circumstances seths motherвђ well youll hear talk if you stay in the area for any length of time oh sybill cut into her fish hoping that she could swallow it my father taught english lit at the university the eastern shore campus of maryland a little less than a year ago a woman came to see him it was a private meeting so we dont have the details but from all accounts it wasnt pleasant she went to the dean and accused my father of sexual harassment sybills fork clattered onto her plate as casually as she could she lifted it again that must have been very difficult for him for all of you difficult isnt quite the word for it she claimed to have been a student here years back and said that at that time he had demanded sex for grades intimidated her had an affair with her no she couldnt swallow sybill realized gripping her fork until her fingers ached she had an affair with your father no she said she did my mother would still have been alive he said half to himself in any case there was no record of her ever attending the university my father taught on that campus for more than twentyfive years without a whisper of improper behavior she took a shot at destroying his reputation and it left a smear of course thered be no truth to it sybill thought wearily it was glorias usual pattern accuse damage run but she herself still had a part to play why why would she do that money i dont understand my father gave her money a great deal of it for seth shes seths mother youre saying that sheвђ she traded her son for money not even gloria could do something so appalling she told herself surely not even gloria thats difficult to believe not all mothers are maternal he jerked a shoulder he had a check for several thousand made out to gloria delauterвђthats her nameвђand he went away for a few days then came back with seth saying nothing she picked up her water glass cooled her throat he came and got seth gloria had sobbed to her theyve got seth you have to help me a few months later phillip continued he drew almost all his savings out into a cashiers check he was on his way back from baltimore when he had an accident he didnt make it im so sorry she murmured the words recognizing their inadequacy he hung on until cam got in from europe he asked the three of us to keep seth to look out for him were doing everything we can to keep that promise i cant say it wasnt rough for a while he added smiling a little now but its never been dull moving back here starting the boat business not such a bad deal cam got a wife out of it he added with a grin anna is seths caseworker really they couldnt have known each other very long i guess when it hits it hits time doesnt factor in shed always believed it did vitally to be successful marriage took planning and dedication and a strong solid knowledge of ones partner an assurance of compatibility an assessment of personal goals then again that portion of the quinn dynamics wasnt her concern thats quite a story how much was true she wondered sick at heart how much was slanted was she supposed to believe that her sister had sold her own son somewhere in the middle she decided the real truth could generally be found somewhere between two opposing stories phillip didnt know she was sure of that now he had no clue what gloria had been to raymond quinn when that single fact was added to the mix how did it change everything else at this point its working out the kids happy another couple of months and the permanent guardianship should be wrapped and this big brother stuff has its advantages gives me somebody to boss around she needed to think she had to put emotion aside and think but she had to get through the evening first how does he feel about that its a perfect setup he can bitch to cam or ethan about me to me about cam or ethan he knows how to play it seths incredibly smart they did placement tests when my father enrolled him in school here hes practically off the charts his final report card for last year straight as really she found herself smiling youre proud of him sure and me im the one who got roped into being homework monitor until recently id forgotten how much i hate fractions now that ive told you my long story why dont you tell me what you think of st chris im just getting my bearings does that mean youll be staying a while yet yes a while you cant really judge a water town unless you spend some time on the water why dont you go sailing with me tomorrow dont you have to get back to baltimore monday she hesitated then reminded herself that this was exactly why she was here if she was to find that real truth she couldnt back away now id like that i cant guarantee what kind of sailor ill be well find out ill pick you up ten tenthirty thatll be fine all of you sail i imagine right down to the dogs he laughed at the expression on her face we wont bring them along im not afraid of them im just not used to them you never had a puppy no cat no goldfish she laughed shook her head no we moved around quite a bit once i had a schoolmate in boston whose dog had puppies they were darling odd she thought to have remembered that now shed wanted one of those pups desperately it had been impossible of course antique fourniture important guests social obligations out of the question her mother had said and that had been the end of it now i move around quite a bit its not practical where do you like best he asked her im flexible wherever i end up tends to suit me until im somewhere else so right now its st chris apparently its interesting she gazed out the window where the rising moon glittered light onto the water the pace is slow but its not stagnant the mood varies as the weather varies after only a few days im able to separate the natives from the tourists and the watermen from everyone else how how distracted she looked back at him how can you tell one from the other just basic observation i can look out of my window onto the waterfront the tourists are couples more likely families occasionally a single they stroll or they shop they rent a boat they interact with each other the ones in their group theyre out of their milieu most will have camera map maybe binoculars most of the natives have a purpose for being there a job an errand they might stop and say hello to a neighbor you can see them easing back on their way as they end the conversation why are you watching from the window i dont understand the question why arent you down on the waterfront i have been but you usually get a purer study when you the observer arent part of the scene id think youd get more varied and more personal input if you were he glanced up as the waiter arrived to top off their wine and offer them dessert just coffee sybill decided decaf the same phillip leaned forward in your book the section on isolation as a survival technique the example you used of having someone lying on the sidewalk how people would look away walk around some might hesitate before hurrying past noninvolvement disassociation exactly but one person would eventually stop try to help once one person broke the isolation others would begin to stop too once the isolation is breached it becomes easier even necessary for others to join its the first step thats the most difficult i conducted that study in new york and london and budapest all with similar results it follows the urban survival technique of avoiding eye contact on the street of blocking the homeless out of our line of sight what makes that first person who stops to help different from everyone else their survival instincts arent as well honed as their compassion or their impulse button is more easily pushed yeah that and theyre involved theyre not just walking through not just there theyre involved and you think that because i observe im not i dont know but i think that observing from a distance isnt nearly as rewarding as experiencing up close observings what i do and i find it rewarding he slid closer and kept his eyes on hers ignoring the waiter who tidily served their coffee but youre a scientist you experiment why dont you give experiencing a try with me she looked down watched his fingertip toy with hers and felt the slow heat of response creep into her blood thats a very novel if roundabout way of suggesting that i sleep with you actually that wasnt what i meantвђthough if the answers yes im all for it he flashed her a grin as she shifted her gaze warily to his i was going to suggest that we take a walk on the waterfront when weve finished our coffee but if youd rather sleep with me we can be in your hotel room in oh five minutes flat she didnt evade when his head lowered to hers when his lips slid lazily into a lovely fit over hers the taste of him was cool with an underlying promise of heat if she wanted it and she did it surprised her how much just at that one moment she wanted the flash and burnвђthe demand that would override the tension inside her the worry the doubts but shed had a lifetime of training against selfindulgence and now she laid a hand lightly on his chest to end the kiss and the temptation i think a walk would be pleasant then well walk he wanted more phillip told himself he should have known that a few tastes of her would stir up the need but he hadnt expected that need to be quite so sharp quite so edgy maybe part of it was sheer ego he mused as he took her hand to walk with her along the quiet waterfront her response had been so cool and controlled it made him wonder what it would be like to peel that intellect away layer by layer and find the woman beneath to work his way down to pure emotion and instinct he nearly laughed at himself ego indeed for all he knew that formal slightly distant response was precisely all that dr sybill griffin intended to give him if so that made her a challenge he was going to have a very difficult time resisting i see why shineys is a popular spot she slanted him a smiling look its barely ninethirty and the shops are closed the boats are moored a few people strolling along but for the most part everything here is tucked in for the night its a little livelier during the summer not much but a little its cooling off are you warm enough mmm plenty its a lovely breeze she stopped to look out at the swaying masts of boats do you keep your boat here no we have a dock at home thats ethans skipjack where its the only skipjack in st chris there are only a couple of dozen left on the bay there he gestured the single mast to her untrained eye one sailboat looked very much the same as the next size varied of course and gloss but essentially they were all boats whats a skipjack it evolved from the flatbottomed baycrabbing skiffs he drew her closer as he spoke they were enlarged designed with a vshaped hull had to be easily and inexpensively built so they go out crabbing in them no mostly the watermen use motorpowered workboats for crabbing the skipjack is for oysters back in the early s they passed a law in maryland that allowed only sailpowered vessels to dredge for oysters conservation exactly the skipjack came out of that and it still survives but there arent many of them there arent many oysters either does your brother still use it yeah its miserable cold hard frustrating work you sound like the voice of experience ive put in some time on her he stopped near the bow and slipped an arm around sybills waist sailing out in february with that wind cutting through you bouncing on the high chop of a winter stormвђ all in all id rather be in baltimore she chuckled studying the boat it looked ancient and rough like something out of an earlier time without having set foot on it im going to agree with you so why were you bouncing on the high chop of a winter storm instead of in baltimore beats the hell out of me i take it this isnt the boat you invited me out on tomorrow no that ones a tidy little pleasure sloop do you swim she arched an eyebrow is that a statement on your sailing abilities no its a suggestion the waters cool but not so cold you couldnt take a dip if you like i didnt bring a bathing suit with me and your point is she laughed and started walking again i think a sails enough for one day ive got some work i want to finish up tonight i enjoyed dinner so did i ill walk you to your hotel theres no need its just around the corner nonetheless she didnt argue she had no intention of allowing him to walk her to her door or to talk his way into her suite all in all she felt she was handling him and a difficult confusing situation very well an early night she mused would give her time to sort out her thoughts and feelings before she saw him again the next day and since the boat was docked at his home the odds were good that she would see seth again too ill come down in the morning she began as she stopped a few feet from the lobby entrance ten or so fine is there anything i should bring besides dramamine he shot her a grin ill take care of it sleep well you too she prepared herself for the easy and expected goodnight kiss his lips were soft undemanding pleased with both of them she relaxed started to back away then his hand cupped the back of her neck firmly his head changed angles and for one staggering moment the kiss went hot and wild and threatening the hand shed laid on his shoulder curled into a fist gripping his jacket hanging on for balance as her feet all but swept out from under her her mind went blank as her pulse leapt to roar in her spinning head someone moaned low and deep and long it lasted only seconds but it was as shocking and burning as a brand he saw the stunned arousal in her eyes when they opened and stared into his and he felt that basic need claw to a new level inside him not a cool controlled and distant response this time he decided one layer down he mused and skimmed his thumb along her jawline ill see you in the morning yesвђgood night she recovered quickly and sent him a smile before turning but she pressed an unsteady hand to her jittery stomach as she slipped into the lobby shed miscalculated that one she admitted fighting to take slow even breaths as she walked to the elevator he wasnt as smooth polished and harmless as he appeared on the surface there was something much more primitive and much more dangerous inside that attractive package than shed realized and whatever it was she found it entirely too compelling for her own good chapter six contents prev next it was like riding a bike or sex phillip mused as he tacked threading through the light traffic on the bay toward an available slip on the waterfront it had been a while since hed done any solo sailing but he hadnt forgotten how if anything hed forgotten how much he enjoyed being out on the water on a breezy sunday morning with the sun warm and the water blue and the wicked screams of gulls echoing on the air he was going to have to start finding time for simple pleasures again since this was the first full day hed taken off in more than two months he intended to make the most of it he certainly intended to make the most of a few golden hours on the bay with the intriguing dr griffin he looked over at the hotel idly trying to calculate which window might be hers from what shed told him he knew it faced the water giving her a view of the life that pulsed there and enough distance for her research then he saw her standing on a tiny balcony her glossy minkcolored hair sleeked back and haloed in the sunlight her face aloof and unreadable from so far away not so aloof close up he thought replaying their last sizzle of a kiss in his mind no thered been nothing aloof in that long throaty moan nothing distant in that quick hard tremble her body had made against his that instinctive involuntary signal of blood calling to blood her eyes that waterclear blue hadnt been cool nor had they been intriguingly remote when hed lifted his mouth from hers and looked into them instead theyd been just a little clouded just a little confused and all the more intriguing he hadnt quite been able to get her taste out of his system not on the drive home not through the night not now seeing her again and knowing she stood and watched him what he wondered do you observe dr griffin and what do you intend to do about it phillip flashed her a quick smile snapped her a salute to let her know hed seen her then he shifted his attention away from her and maneuvered into dock his brows lifted in surprise as he saw seth standing on dock waiting to secure the lines whatre you doing here expertly seth looped the bow line over the post playing errand boy again there was a hint of disgust in the tone but seth had to work to put it there they sent me down from the boatyard donuts yeah phillip stepped nimbly onto the dock artery doggers real people dont eat tree bark for breakfast seth sneered just you and ill still be strong and goodlooking when youre a wheezing old man maybe but ill have more fun phillip tugged seths ball cap off batted him lightly with it depends pal on your definition of fun i guess yours is poking at city girls thats one of them another is hounding you over your homework you finish johnny tremaine for your book report yeah yeah yeah seth rolled his eyes man dont you ever take a day off what when my life is devoted to you he grinned at seths snort so whatd you think of it it was okay then he jerked a shoulder a purely quinn movement it was pretty good well put together some notes for your oral report later tonight sunday nights my favorite night of the week seth said it means youll be gone for four days come on you know you miss me shit you count the hours until i come home seth barely suppressed a giggle like hell then he did giggle as phillip snagged him around the waist for a tussle sybill heard the bright happy sound as she walked toward them she saw the wide grin on seths face her heart did a long slow roll in her chest what was she doing here she asked herself what did she hope to accomplish and how could she walk away until she found out good morning distracted by her voice phillip glanced over dropping his guard just long enough for seths elbow to slip through and into his gut he grunted wrapped an arm around seths neck and leaned down ill have to beat you up later he said in a stage whisper when there arent any witnesses you wish flushed with pleasure seth settled his cap securely on his head and feigned disinterest some of us gotta work today and some of us dont i thought you were going with us sybill said to seth would you like to im just a slave around here seth looked longingly at the boat then shrugged we got a hull to build besides pretty boy here will probably capsize her smartass phillip made a grab but seth danced laughingly out of reach hope she can swim he called out then raced away when phillip looked back at sybill she was gnawing her bottom lip im not going to capsize her wellвђ sybill glanced toward the boat it seemed awfully small and fragile i can swim so i suppose its all right christ kid comes along and completely smears my rep ive been sailing longer than the brats been alive dont be angry with him huh please dont be angry with him im sure he was just joking with you he didnt mean to be disrespectful phillip just stared at her shed actually gone pale and her hand was nervously twisting the thin gold chain she wore around her neck there was active and acute distress in her voice sybill im not mad at him we were just fooling around relax baffled he rubbed his knuckles lightly over her jaw razzing each other is just our clever male way of showing affection oh she wasnt certain whether to be embarrassed or relieved i guess that shows i didnt have any brothers it would have been their job to make your life a living hell he leaned down touched her lips lightly with his its traditional he stepped onto the boat held out a hand after the briefest of hesitations she let him take hers welcome aboard the deck rocked under her feet she did her best to ignore it thank you do i have an assignment for now sit relax and enjoy i should be able to manage that at least she hoped so she sat on one of the padded benches gripping it tightly as he stepped out again to release the lines it would be fine she assured herself it would be fun hadnt she watched him sail into port or dock or whatever you would call it hed seemed very competent even a bit cocky she decided the way hed scanned the hotel until he saw her standing out on her balcony there had been something foolishly romantic about that she thought now the way he had sailed across the sunsplashed water searching for her finding her then the quick smile and wave if her pulse had bumped a little it was an understandable and human response he made such a picture after all the faded jeans the crisp tshirt tucked into them as blindingly white as the sails that gilded hair and the warmly tanned sleekly muscled arms what woman wouldnt feel a bump at the prospect of spending a few hours alone with a man who looked like phillip quinn and kissed like phillip quinn though she had promised herself she wouldnt dwell on that particular talent of his hed shown her just a little too much of that skill the night before now with the sails lowered he motored gently away from the dock she found some security in the low rumble of the engine not that different from a car really she supposed this vehicle just happened to drive over water nor were they really alone her hands relaxed their death grip on the bench as she watched other boats skim and glide she saw a boy who was surely no older than seth tucked into a tiny boat with a triangular red sail if it was an activity considered safe for children surely she could handle it hoisting sails she turned her head smiled absently at phillip what did you say watch he moved gracefully over the deck working the lines then suddenly the sails rose snapped in the wind filled with it her heartbeat skipped and scrambled and her fingers tightened once more on the bench no shed been wrong she saw that now this was nothing at all like a car it was primitive and beautiful and thrilling the boat no longer seemed small or fragile but powerful just a little dangerous and breathtaking very much like the man who captained her its lovely from down here though she kept her hands firmly locked on the bench she smiled over at phillip they always look pretty when i watch from the window but its lovely to see the sails from below youre sitting phillip commented as he took the wheel and youre enjoying but i dont think youre relaxing not yet i might get there she turned her face to the wind it tugged and teased at her hair trying to free it from the band where are we going nowhere in particular her smile warmed and widened i rarely have a chance to go there she hadnt smiled at him just that way before phillip thought without thinking without weighing he doubted she realized how that easy smile transformed her coolly beautiful face into something softer more approachable wanting to touch her he held out a hand come on up here check out the view her smile faded stand up yeah theres no chop today its a smooth ride stand up she repeated giving each word separate weight and walk over there on the boat two steps he couldnt stop the grin you dont want to just be a bystander do you actually yes her eyes widened when he stepped away from the wheel no dont she stifled a scream when he laughed and snagged her hand before she could dig in hed pulled her to her feet off balance she fell against him and held on in terror and defense couldnt have planned that one better he murmured and holding her stepped back to the wheel i like getting close enough to smell you a man has to get almost right hereвђ he turned his head nuzzled his lips on her throat stop thrills and fears raced through her pay attention oh believe meвђhis teeth caught and nipped her earlobeвђi am to the boat pay attention to the boat oh yeah but he kept one arm snug around her waist look out over the bow to port the left he explained that little swash there goes back into the marsh youll see herons and wild turkey where sometimes you have to go in to find them but you can catch sight of them now and then the herons standing like a sculpture in the high grass or rising up from it the turkeys bobbling their way out of the trees she wanted to see she discovered she hoped she would see in another month well have geese flying over from their view this area wouldnt look much different from the everglades her heart was still jumping but she inhaled slowly exhaled deliberately why the marshland its too far from the beaches for the developers to be very interested its largely undisturbed just one of the bays assets one of the factors that makes it an estuary a finer one for watermen than the fjords of norway she inhaled again exhaled why the shallows for one thing a good estuary needs shallows so the sun can nourish aquatic plants plankton and the marshlands for another they add the tidal creeks the coves there he brushed a kiss over the crown on her head now youre relaxing with some surprise she realized she wasnt simply relaxing shed already gotten there so you were appealing to the scientist took your mind off your nerves yes it did odd she thought that he would know so quickly which switch to throw i dont think i have my sea legs yet but it is a pretty view still so green she watched the passing of big leafy trees the deep pockets of shadows in the marsh they sailed by markers topped with huge scruffy nests what birds build those osprey now theyre experts at those disassociation techniques you can sail right by one when its sitting on its nest and itll look right through you survival instinct she murmured shed like to see that too an osprey roosting on that rough circular nest ignoring the humans see those orange buoys crab pots the workboat putting down that gut hes going to check his pots rebait over there to starboard he nudged her head to the right the little outboard looks to me like theyre hoping to catch some rockfish for sunday dinner its a busy place she commented i didnt realize there was so much going on on and under the water he adjusted the sails and heeling in skimmed around a thick line of trees leaning out from shore as they cleared the trees a narrow dock came into view behind it was a sloping lawn flower beds just starting to lose their summer brilliance the house was simple white with blue trim a rocker sat on the wide covered porch and bronzetoned mums speared out of an old crockery tub sybill could hear the light drifting notes of music floating through the open windows chopin she realized after a moment its charming she angled her head shifting slightly to keep the house in view all it needs is a dog a couple of kids tossing a ball and a tire swing we were too old for tire swings but we always had the dog thats our house he told her absently running his hand down her long smooth ponytail yours she strained wanting to see more where seth lived she thought struck by dozens of conflicting emotions we spent plenty of time tossing balls or each other in the backyard well come back later and you can meet the rest of the family she closed her eyes and squashed the guilt id like that he had a place in mind the quiet cove with its lapping water and dappled shade was a perfect spot for a romantic picnic he dropped anchor where the eelgrass gleamed wetly and the sky canopied in unbroken autumnal blue overhead obviously my research on this area was lacking oh phillip opened a large cooler and retrieved a bottle of wine its full of surprises pleasant ones i hope very pleasant ones she smiled raising a brow at the label on the wine he opened very pleasant you struck me as a woman whod appreciate a fine dry sancerre youre very astute indeed i am from a wicker hamper he took two wineglasses and poured to pleasant surprises he said and tapped his glass to hers are there more he took her hand kissed her fingers weve barely started setting his glass aside he unfolded a white cloth and spread it on the deck your tables ready ah enjoying herself she sat shaded her eyes against the sun and smiled up at him whats todays special some rather nice pate to stir the appetite to demonstrate he opened a small container and a box of stoned wheat crackers he spread one for her and held it to her lips mmm she nodded after the first bite very nice to be followed by crab salad a la quinn sounds intriguing and did you make it with your own two hands i did he grinned at her im a hell of a cook the man cooks has excellent taste in wine appreciates ambience and wears his levis very well she bit into the pate again relaxed now the ground familiar and easily negotiated you appear to be quite a catch mr quinn i am indeed dr griffin she laughed into her wine and how often have you brought some lucky woman to this spot for crab salad a la quinn actually i havent been here with a woman since the summer of my sophomore year in college then it was a fairly decent chablis chilled shrimp and marianne teasdale i suppose i should be flattered i dont know marianne was pretty hot he flashed that killer grin again but being callow and shortsighted i threw her over for a premed student with a sexy lisp and big brown eyes lisps do weaken a man did marianne recover enough to marry a plumber from princess anne and bear him two children but of course we know she secretly yearns for me laughing sybill spread a cracker for him i like you i like you too he caught her wrist holding it as he nibbled at the cracker she held and you dont even lisp when his fingers continued to nibble at the tips of her fingers now it wasnt quite as easy to breathe youre very smooth she murmured youre very lovely thank you what i should say she continued and eased her hand out of his is that while youre very smooth and very attractive and im enjoying spending time with you i dont intend to be seduced you know what they say about intentions i tend to hold to mine and while i do enjoy your company i also recognize your type she smiled again and gestured with her glass a hundred years ago the word rogue would have come to mind he considered a moment that didnt sound like an insult it wasnt meant to be rogues are invariably charming and very rarely serious i have to object there there are some issues that im very serious about lets try this she peeked in the cooler and took out another container have you ever been married no engaged she asked as she opened the lid and discovered a beautifully prepared crab salad no have you ever lived with a woman for a consecutive period of six months or more with a shrug he took plates out of the hamper passed her a paleblue linen napkin no so we can theorize that one of the issues about which you are not serious is relationships or we can theorize that i have yet to meet the woman i want a serious relationship with we could howeverвђ she narrowed her eyes at his face as he scooped salad onto the plates youre what thirty one he added a thick slice of french bread to each plate thirtyone typically by the age of thirty a man in this culture would have experienced at least one serious longterm monogamous relationship i wouldnt care to be typical olives yes thanks typical is not necessarily an unattractive trait nor is conformity everyone conforms even those who consider themselves the rebels of society conform to certain codes and standards enjoying her he tilted his head is that so dr griffin quite so gang members in the inner city have internal rules codes standards colors she added selecting an olive from her plate in that way they dont differ much from members of the city council you had to be there phillip mumbled excuse me nothing what about serial killers they follow patterns enjoying herself she tore a chunk off her slice of bread the fbi studies them catalogs them profiles them society wouldnt term them standards certainly but in the strictest sense of the word thats precisely what they are damned if she didnt have a point he decided and found himself only more fascinated so you the observer size people up by noting what rules codes patterns they follow more or less people arent so very difficult to understand if you pay attention what about those surprises she smiled appreciating the question as much as she appreciated that he would think to ask it most laymen shed socialized with werent really interested in her work theyre factored in theres always margin for error and for adjustments this is wonderful salad she sampled another bite and the surprise a pleasant one is that you would have gone to the trouble to prepare it dont you find that people are usually willing to go to some trouble for someone they care for when she only blinked at him he tilted his head well well that threw you off you barely know me she picked up her wine a purely defensive gesture theres a difference between being attracted to and caring for the latter takes more time some of us move fast he enjoyed seeing her flustered it would be he decided a rare event taking advantage of it he slid closer i do so ive already observed howeverвђ however i like hearing you laugh i like feeling you tremble just slightly when i kiss you i like hearing your voice slide into that didactic tone when you expand on a theory at the last comment she frowned im not didactic charmingly he murmured skimming his lips over her temple and i like seeing your eyes in that moment when i start to confuse you therefore i believe ive crossed over into the carefor stage so lets try your earlier hypothesis out on you and see where that leaves us have you ever been married his mouth was cruising just under her ear making it very difficult to think clearly no well not really he paused leaned back narrowed his eyes no or not really it was an impulse an error in judgment it was less than six months it didnt count her brain was fogged she decided trying to inch away for some breathing room he only scooted her back you were married only technically it didntвђ she turned her head to make her point and his mouth was there right there to meet hers to urge her lips to part and warm and soften it was like sliding under a slowmoving wave being taken down into silky shimmering water everything inside her went fluid a surprise she would realize later that shed neglected to factor into this particular pattern it didnt count she managed as her head fell back as his lips trailed smoothly down her throat okay if hed taken her by surprise shed done exactly the same to him at her sudden and utter surrender to the moment his need churned to the surface thrashing there he had to touch her to fill his hands with her to mold those pretty curves through the thin crisp cotton of her blouse he had to taste her deeper now while those little hums of shock and pleasure sounded in her throat as he did as he touched and as he tasted her arms came around him her hands sliding into his hair her body turning to fit itself against him he felt her heart thud in time with his own panic punched through pleasure when she felt him tug at the buttons of her blouse no her own fingers shook as she covered his its too fast she squeezed her eyes shut struggling to find her control her sense her purpose im sorry i dont go this fast i cant it wasnt easy to check the urge to ignore the rules to simply press her under him on the deck until she was pliant and willing again he put his tense fingers under her chin and lifted her face to his no it wasnt easy he thought again as he saw both desire and denial in her eyes but it was necessary okay no rush he rubbed his thumb over her bottom lip tell me about the one that didnt count her thoughts had scattered to the edges of her mind she couldnt begin to draw them together while he was looking at her with those tawny eyes what the husband oh she looked away concentrated on her breathing what are you doing relaxation technique humor danced back and made him grin at her does it work eventually cool he shifted until they were hip to hip and timed his breathing to hers so this guy you were technically married toвђ it was in college at harvard he was a chemistry major eyes shut she ordered her toes to relax then her arches her ankles we were barely twenty and just lost our heads for a short time eloped yes we didnt even live together because we were in different dorms so it wasnt really a marriage it was weeks before we told our families and then naturally there were several difficult scenes why becauseвђ she blinked her eyes open found the sun dazzling something plopped in the water behind her then there was only the lap of it kissing the hull we werent suited we had no feasible plans we were too young the divorce was very quiet and quick and civilized did you love him i was twenty her relaxation level was reaching her shoulders of course i thought i did love has little complexity at that age so spoken from the advanced age of what twentyseven twentyeight twentynine and counting she let out a last long breath satisfied and steady she turned to look at him again i havent thought of rob in years he was a very nice boy i hope hes happy and thats it for you it has to be he nodded but found her story strangely sad then i have to say dr griffin that using your own scale you dont take relationships seriously she opened her mouth to protest then wisely shut it again casually she picked up the wine bottle and topped off both glasses you may be right ill have to give that some thought chapter seven contents prev next seth didnt mind running herd on aubrey she was kind of his niece now that ethan and grace were married being an uncle made him feel adult and responsible besides all she really wanted to do was race around the yard every time he threw a ball or a stick for one of the dogs she went into gales of laughter a guy couldnt help but get a kick out of it she was pretty cute too with her curly gold hair and her big green eyes that looked amazed at everything he did spending an hour or two on a sunday entertaining her wasnt a bad deal he hadnt forgotten where he had been a year ago thered been no big backyard that fell off into the water no woods to explore no dogs to wrestle with no little girl who looked at him like he was fox mulder all the power rangers and superman rolled into one instead thered been grungy rooms three flights up from the street and those streets had been a dark carnival at night a place where everything had its price sex drugs weapons misery hed learned that no matter what went on in those grungy rooms he shouldnt go out after dark thered been no one to care if he was clean or fed if he was sick or scared hed never felt like a hero there or even very much like a kid hed felt like a thing and hed learned quickly that things are often hunted gloria had ridden all the rides in that carnival again and again shed brought the freaks and the hustlers into those rooms selling herself to whoever would pay the price of her next spin a year ago seth hadnt believed his life would ever be any different then ray came and took him to the house by the water ray showed him a different world and promised he would never have to go back to the old one ray had died but he had kept his promise all the same now seth could stand in the big backyard with water lapping at its edges and throw balls and sticks for the dogs to chase while an angelfaced toddler laughed seth let me let me aubrey danced on her sturdy little legs holding up both hands for the mangled ball okay you throw it he grinned while she screwed up her face with concentration and effort the ball bounced inches away from the toes of her brightred sneakers simon snapped it up making her squeal with delight then politely offered it back oooh good doggie aubrey batted the patient simon on either side of his jaw angling for attention foolish nudged his way in shoved her down on her butt she rewarded him with a fierce hug now you she ordered seth you do it obliging her seth winged the ball he laughed as the dogs raced after it bumping their bodies like two football players rushing downfield they crashed into the woods sending a pair of birds squawking skyward at that moment with aubrey bouncing with giggles the dogs barking the fresh september air on his cheeks seth was completely happy a part of his mind focused on it snatched at it to keep the angle of the sun the brilliance of light on the water the creamy sound of otis redding drifting through the kitchen window the bitchy complaints of the birds and the rich salty scent of the bay he was home then the putt of a motor caught his attention when he turned he saw the family sloop angling in toward the dock at the wheel phillip raised a hand in greeting even as seth returned the wave his gaze shifted to the woman standing beside phillip it felt as if something brushed over the nape of his neck light and cagey as the legs of a spider absently he rubbed at it shrugged his shoulders then took aubrey firmly by the hand remember you have to stay in the middle of the dock she gazed up at him adoringly okay i will mama says never never go by the water by myself thats right he stepped onto the dock with her and waited for phillip to come alongside it was the woman who awkwardly tossed him the bow line sybill something he thought for a moment as she balanced herself as their eyes met he felt that sly tickle on the nape of his neck again then the dogs were bounding onto the dock and aubrey was laughing again hey angel baby phillip helped sybill step onto the dock then winked down at aubrey up she demanded you bet he swung her onto his hip and planted a smacking kiss on her cheek when are you going to grow up and marry me tomorrow thats what you always say this is sybill sybill meet aubrey my best girl shes pretty aubrey stated and flashed her dimples thank you so are you as the dogs bumped her legs sybill jolted and took a step back phillip shot out a hand to grab her arm before she backed her way off the dock and into the water steady there seth call off the dogs sybills a little uneasy around them they wont hurt you seth said with a shake of his head that warned sybill shed just dropped several notches in his estimation but he snagged both dogs by the collar holding them back until she could ease by everybody inside phillip asked seth yeah just hanging until dinner grace brought over a monster chocolate cake cam sweettalked anna into making lasagna god bless him my sisterinlaws lasagna is a work of art he told sybill speaking of art i wanted to tell you again seth how much i liked the sketches youve done for the boatyard theyre very good he shrugged his shoulders then bent down to scoop up two sticks to toss and distract the dogs i just draw sometimes me too she knew it was foolish but sybill felt her cheeks go warm at the way seth studied her measured and judged its something i like to do in my spare time she went on i find it relaxing and satisfying yeah i guess maybe youll show me more of your work sometime if you want he pushed open the door to the kitchen and headed straight to the refrigerator a telling sign sybill mused he was at home here she took a quick scan of the room filing impressions there was a pot simmering on what seemed to be an ancient stove the scent was impossibly aromatic several small clay pots lined the windowsill over the sink fresh herbs thrived in them the counters were clean if a bit worn a pile of papers was stacked on the end beneath a wall phone and anchored with a set of keys a shallow bowl was centered on the table and filled with glossy red and green apples a mug of coffee half full stood in front of a chair under which someone had kicked off shoes goddamn it that ump ought to be shot in the head that pitch was a mile high sybill arched an eyebrow at the furious male voice from the next room phillip merely smiled and jiggled aubrey on his hip ball game cams taking this years pennant race personally the game i forgot seth slammed the refrigerator door and raced out of the kitchen whats the score what inning is it whos up three to two as bottom of the sixth two outs a man on second now sit down and shut up very personally phillip added then set aubrey down when she wiggled baseball often becomes a personal challenge between the audience and the opposing team especially sybill added with a sober nod during the september pennant race you like baseball whats not to like she said and laughed its a fascinating study of men of teamwork of battle speed cunning finesse and always pitcher against batter in the end it all comes down to style endurance and math were going to have to take in a game at camden yards he decided id just love to hear your playbyplay technique can i get you anything no im fine more shouts more cursing burst out of the living room but i think it might be dangerous to leave this room as long as your brothers team is down a run youre perceptive phillip reached out to curve his hand over her cheek so why dont we stay right here andвђ way to go call cam shouted from the living room that son of a bitch is amazing shit seths voice was cocky and smug no stinking california outfielders going to blow one by ripken phillip let out a sigh or maybe we should head out back and take a walk for a few innings seth i believe weve discussed acceptable word usage in this house anna phillip murmured coming downstairs to lay down the law cameron youre supposed to be an adult its baseball sugar if the pair of you dont watch your language the tv goes off shes very strict phillip informed sybill were all terrified of her really sybill considered as she glanced toward the living room she heard another voice lower softer then aubreys firm response no mama please i want seth shes okay grace she can stay with me the easy absent tone of seths voice had sybill considering its unusual id think for a boy seths age to be so patient with a toddler phillip shrugged his shoulders and walked to the stove to start a pot of fresh coffee they hit it off right away aubrey adores him that has to boost the kids ego and hes really good with her he turned smiling as two women walked into the room ah the ones who got away sybill these are the women my brothers stole from me anna grace dr sybill griffin he only wanted us to cook for him anna said with a laugh and held out a hand its nice to meet you ive read your books i think theyre brilliant taken by surprise both by the statement and the lush and outrageous beauty of anna spinelli quinn sybill nearly fumbled thank you i appreciate you tolerating a sundayevening intrusion its no intrusion were delighted and anna thought incredibly curious in the seven months shed known phillip this was the first woman hed brought home to sunday dinner phillip go watch baseball she waved him toward the doorway with the back of her hand grace and sybill and i can get acquainted shes bossy too phillip warned sybill just yell if you need help and ill come rescue you he gave her a hard firm kiss on the mouth before she could think to evade it then deserted her anna gave a long interested hum then smiled brightly lets have some wine grace pulled out a chair phillip said you were going to stay in st chris a while and write a book about it something like that sybill took a deep breath they were just women after all a stunning darkeyed brunette and a cool lovely blonde there was no need to be nervous actually i plan to write about the culture and traditions and social landscapes of small towns and rural communities we have both on the shore so i see you and ethan are recently married graces smile warmed and her gaze shifted to the gold band on her finger just last month and you grew up here together i was born here ethan moved here when he was about twelve are you from the area too she asked anna more comfortable in the role of interviewer no im from pittsburgh i moved to dc wandered down to princess anne i work for social services as a caseworker thats one of the reasons i was so interested in your books she set a glass of deepred wine in front of sybill oh yes youre seths caseworker phillip told me a little about the situation mmm was annas only comment as she turned to take a bib apron from a hook did you enjoy your sail so sybill realized discussing seth with outsiders was offlimits she ordered herself to accept that for now yes very much more than id expected to i cant believe ive gone so long without trying it i had my first sail a few months ago anna set a huge pot of water on the stove to boil grace has been sailing all her life do you work here in st christophers yes i clean houses including this one thank the lord anna put in i was telling grace she ought to start a company maids are us or something when grace laughed anna shook her head im serious it would be a terrific service to the working woman in particular you could even do commercial buildings if you trained two or three people word of mouth alone would get it going you think bigger than i do i dont know how to run a business i bet you do your familys been running the crab house for generations crab house sybill interrupted picking packing shipping grace lifted a hand odds are if youve had crab while youve been here it came to you via my fathers company but ive never been involved in the business end that doesnt mean you couldnt handle your own business anna took a chunk of mozzarella out of the refrigerator and began to grate it a lot of people out there are more than willing to pay for good reliable and trustworthy domestic services they dont want to spent what little free time they might have cleaning the house cooking meals separating laundry traditional roles are shiftingвђdont you agree sybill women cant spend every spare second of their time in the kitchen well i would agree butвђ well here you are anna stopped blinked then threw back her head and laughed she looked sybill thought like a woman who should be dancing around a campfire to the sound of violins rather than cozily grating cheese in a fragrant kitchen youre right absolutely still chuckling anna shook her head here i am while my man lounges in front of the tv deaf and blind to anything but the game and this is often the scene on sundays around here i dont mind i love to cook really hearing the suspicion in sybills voice anna laughed again really i find it satisfying but not when i have to rush in from work and toss something together thats why we take turns around here mondays are leftovers from whatever ive cooked sunday tuesdays we all suffer through whatever cam cooks because hes simply dreadful in the kitchen wednesdays we do takeout thursdays i cook fridays phillip cooks and saturdays are up for grabs its a very workable system when it works annas planning on having seth take over as chef on wednesdays within the year at his age anna shook back her hair hell be eleven in a couple of weeks by the time i was his age i could make a killer red sauce the time and effort it takes to teach him and to convince him hes still a male if he knows how to make a meal will be worth it in the end and she added sliding wide flat noodles into the boiling water if i use the fact that he can outdo cam in any area hell be an a student they dont get along theyre wonderful together anna tilted her head as the living room exploded with shouts cheers stomping and seth likes nothing more than to impress his big brother which means of course they argue and prod each other constantly she smiled again i take it you dont have any brothers no no i dont sisters grace asked and wondered why sybills eyes went so cool one i always wanted a sister grace smiled over at anna now ive got one grace and i were both only children anna squeezed graces shoulder as she walked by to mix her cheeses something in that easy intimate gesture stirred a tug of envy inside sybill since we fell in with the quinns weve been making up rapidly for coming from small families does your sister live in new york no sybills stomach clenched reflexively were not terribly close excuse me she pushed away from the table can i use the bathroom sure down the hall first door on the left anna waited until sybill walked out then pursed her lips at grace i cant decide what i think about her she seems a little uncomfortable anna shrugged her shoulders well i guess well have to wait and see wont we in the little powder room off the hall sybill splashed water on her face she was hot nervous and vaguely sick to her stomach she didnt understand this family she thought they were loud occasionally crude pieced together from different origins yet they seemed happy at ease with each other and very affectionate as she patted her face dry she met her own eyes in the mirror her family had never been loud or crude except for those ugly moments when gloria had pushed the limits just now she couldnt honestly say for certain if they had ever been happy ever been at ease with each other and affection had never been a priority or something that was expressed in an overt manner it was simply that none of them were very emotional people she told herself she had always been more cerebral out of inclination she decided and in defense against glorias baffling volatility life was calmer if one depended on the intellect she knew that believed that absolutely but it was her emotions that were churning now she felt like a liar a spy a sneak reminding herself that she was doing what she was doing for the welfare of a child helped telling herself that the child was her own nephew and she had every right to be there to form opinions soothed objectivity she told herself pressing her fingertips against her temples to smother the nagging ache thats what would get her through until shed gathered all the facts all the data and formed her opinion she stepped out quietly and took the few steps down the hall toward the blaring noise of the ball game she saw seth sprawled on the floor at cams feet and shouting abuse at the set across the room cam was gesturing with his beer and arguing the last call with phillip ethan simply watched the game with aubrey curled in his lap dozing despite the noise the room itself was homey slightly shabby and appeared comfortable a piano was angled out from the corner a vase of zinnias and dozens of smallframed snapshots crowded its polished surface a half empty bowl of potato chips sat at seths elbow the rug was littered with crumbs shoes the sunday paper and a grubby wellgnawed hunk of rope the light had faded but no one had bothered to switch on a lamp she started to step back but phillip glanced over smiled held out a hand she walked to him let him draw her down to the arm of his chair bottom of the ninth he murmured were up by one watch this reliever kick this guys sorry ass seth kept his voice down but it rang with glee he didnt even flinch when cam slapped him on the head with his own ball cap oh yeah struck him out he leaped up did a victory boogie we are number one man im starving he raced off to the kitchen and soon could be heard begging for food winning ball games works up an appetite phillip decided absently kissing sybills hand hows she doing in there she appeared to be on top of things lets go see if she made antipasto he pulled her into the kitchen and within moments it was crowded with people aubrey rested her head on ethans shoulder and blinked like an owl seth stuffed his mouth with tidbits from an elaborate tray and did a playbyplay of the game everyone seemed to be moving talking eating at the same time sybill thought phillip put another glass of wine in her hand before he was drafted to deal with the bread because she felt slightly less confused by him than by the others sybill stuck to his side as chaos reigned he cut thick slices of italian bread then doctored them with butter and garlic is it always like this she murmured to him no he picked up his own glass of wine touched it lightly to hers sometimes its really loud and disorganized by the time he drove her back to her hotel sybills head was ringing there was so much to process sights sounds personalities impressions she had survived complex state dinners with less confusion than a sunday dinner with the quinns she needed time she decided to analyze once she was able to write down her thoughts her observations she would align them dissect them and begin to draw her initial conclusions tired she sighed once a little it was quite a day a fascinating one blew out a breath and a fattening one im definitely going to make use of the hotels health club in the morning i enjoyed myself she added as he parked near the lobby entrance very much good then youll be willing to do it again he climbed out skirted the hood then took her hand as she stepped onto the curb theres no need for you to take me up i know the way ill take you up anyway im not going to ask you to come in im still going to walk you to your door sybill she let it go crossing with him to the elevators stepping inside with him when the doors opened so youll drive to baltimore in the morning she pushed the button for her floor tonight when things are fairly settled here i drive back sunday nights theres rarely any traffic and i can get an earlier start on mondays it cant be easy for you the commute the demands on your time and the tugofwar of responsibilities a lot of things arent easy but theyre worth working for he caressed her hair i dont mind putting time and effort into something i enjoy wellвђ she cleared her throat and walked out of the elevator the minute the doors opened i appreciate the time and effort you put into today ill be back thursday night i want to see you she slipped her key card out of her purse i cant be sure right now what ill be doing at the end of the week he simply framed her face with his hands moved in and covered her mouth with his the taste of her he thought he couldnt seem to get enough of the taste of her i want to see you he murmured against her lips shed always been so good at staying in control at distancing herself from attempts at seduction from resisting the persuasions of physical attractions but with him each time she could feel herself slipping a little farther a little deeper im not ready for this she heard herself say neither am i still he drew her closer held her tighter and took the kiss toward desperation i want you maybe its a good thing we both have a few days to think about what happens next she looked up at him shaken yearning and just a little frightened of what was happening inside her yes i think its a very good thing she turned had to use both hands to shove the key card into its slot drive carefully she stepped inside closed the door quickly then leaned back against it until she was certain her heart wasnt going to pump its way out of her chest it was insane she thought absolutely insane to get this involved this quickly she was honest enough with herself scientist enough not to skew the results with incorrect data to admit that what was happening to her where phillip quinn was concerned had nothing whatsoever to do with seth it should be stopped she closed her eyes and felt the pressure of his mouth still vibrating on her lips and she was afraid it couldnt be stopped chapter eight contents prev next it was probably a chancy step to take sybill wondered if it could possibly be illegal loitering near st christophers middle school certainly made her feel like some sort of criminal no matter how firmly she told herself she was doing nothing wrong she was simply walking on a public street in the middle of the afternoon it wasnt as though she was stalking seth or planning to abduct him she only wanted to talk to him to see him alone for a little while shed waited until the middle of the week watching from a careful distance on monday and tuesday to gauge his routine and the timing habitually she now knew the buses lumbered up to school several minutes before the doors opened and children began pouring out elementary first then middle then the high school students that alone was a lesson in the process of childhood she mused the compact little bodies and fresh round faces of the elementary children then the more gangling somewhat awkward forms of those who hovered around puberty and last the astonishingly adult and more individual young people who strolled out of the high school it was a study in itself she decided from dangling shoelaces and gaptoothed smiles to cowlicks and ball jackets to baggy jeans and shining falls of hair children had never been a part of her life or her interests shed grown up in a world of adults and had been expected to acclimate to conform there had been no big yellow school buses no wild rebel yells when bursting out of the school doors into freedom no lingering in the parking lot with some leatherjacketed bad boy so she observed all those things here like an audience at a play and found the mix of drama and comedy both amusing and informative when seth hurried out bumping bodies with the darkhaired boy shed decided was his most usual companion her pulse quickened he whipped his ball cap out of his pocket and put it on his head the moment he was through the doors a ritual she thought symbolizing the change of rules the other boy fished in his pocket and pulled out a fistful of bubblegum in seconds it was wadded into his mouth the noise level rose making it impossible for her to hear their conversation but it appeared to be animated and included a great deal of elbow jabbing and shoulder punching typical male affection pattern she concluded they turned their backs on the buses and began to walk down the sidewalk moments later a smaller boy raced up to them he bounced sybill noted and seemed to have a great deal to say for himself she waited a moment longer then casually took a path that would intersect with theirs shit man that geography test was nothing a bozo couldve aced it seth shrugged to distribute the weight of his backpack the other boy blew an impressive candypink bubble popped it then sucked it in i dont know whats the big damn deal about knowing all the states and capitals its not like im going to live in north dakota seth hello sybill watched him stop adjust his train of thought and focus on her oh yeah hi i guess schools done for the day you heading home the boatyard there was that little dance on the nape of his neck again it irritated him we got work im going that way myself she tried a smile on the other boys hi im sybill im danny the other boy told her thats will nice to meet you we had vegetable soup for lunch will informed everyone grandly and lisa harbough threw up all over and mr jim had to clean it up and her mom came to get her and we couldnt write our vocabulary words he danced around sybill as he relayed the information then shot her an amazingly innocent wonderfully bright smile that she was helpless to resist i hope lisas feeling better soon once when i threw up i got to stay home and watch tv all day me and danny live over there on heron lane where do you live im just visiting my uncle john and aunt margie moved to south carolina and we got to visit them they have two dogs and a baby named mike do you have dogs and babies noвђ no i dont you can get them he told her you can go right to the animal shelter and get a dogвђthats what we did and you can get married and make a baby so it lives in your stomach theres nothing to it jeez will seth rolled his eyes while sybill only managed to blink well im going to have dogs and babies when i grow up as many as i want he flashed that hundredwatt smile again then raced away bye hes such a geek danny said with the shuddering disdain of older brother for younger see you seth he bounded after will turned briefly to run backward and flipped a wave toward sybill bye wills not really a geek seth told sybill hes just a kid and hes got diarrhea of the mouth but hes pretty cool hes certainly friendly she shifted her shoulder bag smiled down at him do you mind if i walk the rest of the way with you its okay i thought i heard you say something about a geography test yeah we took one today it was nothing you like school its there he jerked his shoulder you gotta go i always enjoyed it learning new things she laughed lightly i suppose i was a geek seth angled his head narrowing his eyes as he studied her face a looker phillip had called her he remembered he guessed she was she had nice eyes the light color a sharp contrast to the dark lashes her hair wasnt as dark as annas nor light like graces it was really shiny he noted and the way she pulled it back all smooth and stuff left her face right out there she might be cool to draw sometime you dont look like a geek seth announced just as sybill felt heat begin to rise into her cheeks under his long intense study anyway that would be a nerd oh she wasnt sure if shed just qualified for nerd status and decided not to ask what do you like studying best i dont know mostly its just a bunch ofвђstuff he decided quickly censoring his opinion i guess i like it better when we get to read about people instead of things ive always liked to study people she stopped and gestured toward a small twostory gray house with a trim front yard my theory would be that a young family lives there both husband and wife work outside the home and they have a preschooler most likely a boy odds are that theyve known each other a number of years and have been married less than seven how come well its the middle of the day and no ones home no cars in the drive and the house looks empty but theres a tricycle there and several large toy trucks the house isnt new but its well kept most young couples both work today in order to buy a home have a family they live in a small community younger people rarely settle in small towns unless one or both of them grew up there so id theorize that this couple lived here knew each other eventually married its likely they had their first child within the first three years of marriage and the toys indicate hes three to five thats pretty cool seth decided after a moment however foolish it was she felt a surge of pride that she might have avoided nerddom after all but id want to know more wouldnt you shed caught his interest like what why did they choose this particular house what are their goals what is the status of their relationship who handles the money which indicates the disposition of power and why if you study people you see the patterns how come it matters i dont understand who cares she considered well if you understand the patterns the social picture on a large scale you learn why people behave in certain manners what if they dont fit bright boy she thought on another deeper wave of pride everyone fits some pattern you factor in background genetics education social strata religious and cultural roots you get paid for that yes i suppose i do weird now she concluded she had definitely been relegated to nerd status it can be interesting she racked her brain to come up with an example that would salvage his opinion of her i did this experiment once in several cities i arranged for a man to stand on the street and stare up at a building just stare at it thats right he stood there and stared up shading his eyes from the sun when he had to before long someone stopped beside him and stared up at the same building then another and another until there was a crowd of people all looking up at that building it took much longer for anyone to actually ask what was going on what were they looking at no one really wanted to be the first to ask because that was an admission that you didnt see what you assumed everyone else was seeing we want to conform we want to fit in we want to know and see and understand what the person beside us knows and sees and understands i bet some of them thought someone was going to jump out of a window very likely the average time an individual stood looking interrupting their schedule was two minutes she believed shed caught his imagination again and so she hurried on thats actually quite a long time to stare at a perfectly ordinary building thats pretty cool but its still weird they were coming to the point where he would have to veer off to go to the boatyard she thought quickly and in a rare move went with impulse what do you think would happen if you conducted the same experiment in st christophers i dont know the same thing i doubt it she sent him a conspirators smile want to try it maybe we can head over to the waterfront now will your brother worry if youre a few minutes late should you go tell him youre with me nah cam doesnt keep me on a leash he cuts me some slack time she wasnt sure how she felt about the loose discipline in that area but at the moment she was happy to take advantage of it lets try it then ill pay you in ice cream you got a deal they turned away from the boatyard you can pick a spot she began its necessary to stand people dont generally pay attention to someone whos sitting and looking they often assume the person is simply daydreaming or resting i get it its more effective if you look up at something is it okay if i videotape he raised his eyebrows as she took a neat compact video recorder out of her bag yeah i guess you carry that around all the time when im working i do and a notebook and a micro audio tape recorder backup batteries and tapes extra pencils my cell phone she laughed at herself i like being prepared and the day they make a computer small enough to fit in a purse im going to be the first in line phil likes all that electronic stuff too the baggage of the urbanite were desperate not to waste a minute then of course we cant get away from anything because were plugged in every second of the day you could just turn everything off yes oddly she found the simplicity of his statement profound i suppose i could pedestrian traffic was light on the waterfront she saw a workboat unloading the days catch and a family taking advantage of the balmy afternoon by splurging on ice cream sundaes at one of the little outdoor tables two old men their faces nut brown and deeply seamed sat on an iron bench with a checkerboard between them neither seemed inclined to make a move a trio of women chatted in the doorway of one of the shops but only one of them carried a bag im going to stand over there seth pointed to his spot and look up at the hotel good choice sybill stayed where she was as he strolled off distance was necessary to keep the experiment pure she lifted the camera zoomed in as seth moved away he turned once shot her a quick cocky smile and when his face filled her view screen emotions she hadnt been prepared for flooded her he was so handsome so bright so happy she struggled to pull herself back from a dangerous edge that she was afraid was despair she could walk away she thought pack up and leave never see him again he would never know who she was or what they were to each other he would never miss whatever she could bring into his life she was nothing to him shed never really tried to be it was different now she reminded herself she was making it different now deliberately she ordered her fingers to relax her neck her arms she was causing no harm by getting to know him spending some time studying his situation she taped him as he settled on his spot lifted his face his profile was finer more angled than glorias sybill decided perhaps his bone structure had come from his father his build wasnt glorias either as shed first assumed but more like her own and her mothers he would be tall when he finished growing mostly leg and on the slim side his body language she saw with a slight jolt was typical quinn already hed taken on some of the traits of his foster family that hipshot stance hands tucked into pockets head angled she fought back an annoying spurt of resentment and ordered herself to focus on the experiment it took just over a minute for the first person to stop beside seth she recognized the big woman with the graystreaked hair who manned the counter at crawfords everyone called her mother as expected the woman shifted her gaze tilted her face up to follow seths line of sight but after a quick scan she patted seth on the shoulder whatre you looking at boy nothing he muttered it so that sybill edged closer to try to pick up his voice on the tape well hell you stand there for long looking at nothing peoplere going to think youre pixilated why arent you down to the boatyard im going in a minute hey mother hi seth a pretty young woman with dark hair stepped into the frame glanced up at the hotel something going on up there i dont see anything nothing to see mother informed her boys just standing looking at nothing hows your mama julie oh shes a little under the weather shes got a sore throat and a little cough chicken soup hot tea and honey grace brought some soup over this morning you see she eats it hey there jim afternoon a short stocky man in white rubber boots clumped over gave seth a friendly swat on the head what you staring at up there boy jeez cant a guy just stand around seth turned his face to the camera rolled his eyes for sybill and made her chuckle stand here long gullsll light on you jim winked at him capns in for the day he added referring to ethan he gets to the boatyard before you hes gonna want to know why im going im going man shoulders rounded head down seth stalked back to sybill nobodys falling for it because everyone knows you she switched off the camera lowered it it changes the pattern you figured that would happen i theorized she corrected that in a closely knit area where the subject was known the pattern would be that an individual would stop they would probably look first then question theres no risk no loss of ego when questioning a familiar person and a young one at that he frowned over toward where the trio continued to chat so i still get paid absolutely and youll likely rate a section in my book cool ill take a cookie dough cone ive got to get to the boatyard before cam and ethan hassle me if theyre going to be angry with you ill explain its my fault youre late they wont be pissed or anything beside ill tell them it was like for science right when he flashed that grin she had to resist an unexpected urge to hug him thats exactly right she risked laying a hand on his shoulder as they started toward crawfords she thought she felt him stiffen and casually let her hand drop away and we can always call them on my cell phone yeah way cool can i do it sure why not twenty minutes later sybill was at her desk fingers racing over her keyboard though i spent less than an hour with him i would conclude that the subject is extremely bright phillip informed me that he achieves high grades academically which is admirable it was satisfying to discover that he has a questioning mind his manners are perhaps a bit rough but not unpleasant he appears to be considerably more outgoing socially than his mother or i were at his age in that i mean he seems quite natural with relative strangers without the polite formality that was stressed in my own upbringing part of this may be due to the influence of the quinns they are as i have noted previously informal casual people i would also conclude from watching both the children and the adults with whom he interacted today that he is generally well liked in this community and accepted as part of it naturally i cannot at this early stage conclude whether or not his best interest would be served by remaining here its simply not possible to ignore glorias rights nor have i attempted as yet to discover the boys wishes as concern his mother i would prefer that he grow accustomed to me feel comfortable around me before he learns of our family connection i need more time toвђ she broke off as the phone rang and scanning her hastily typed notes picked up the receiver dr griffin hello dr griffin why do i suspect ive interrupted your work she recognized phillips voice the amusement in it and with a flare of guilt lowered the top of her computer because youre a perceptive man but i can spare a few minutes how are things in baltimore busy hows this the visual is a handsome young couple beaming smiles as they carry their laughing toddler to a midsize sedan caption myerstone tires your family matters to us manipulative the consumer is led to believe that if he or she buys another brand the family doesnt matter to that other company yeah it works of course were hitting the car mags with a different image screaming convertible in kickass red long winding road sexy blonde at the wheel myerstone tires you can drive there or you can be there clever the client likes it and that takes a load off hows life in st chris quiet she bit her lip i ran into seth a bit ago actually i drafted him to help me with an experiment it went well oh yeah how much did you have to pay him an ice cream cone double scoop you got off cheap the kids an operator how about dinner tomorrow night a bottle of champagne to celebrate our mutual successes speaking of operators ive been thinking about you all week three days she corrected and picking up a pencil began to doodle on her pad and nights with this account settled i can get out a little earlier tomorrow why dont i pick you up at seven im not sure where were going phillip neither am i do you need to be she understood that neither of them was speaking of restaurants its less confusing that way then well talk about it and maybe well get past the confusion seven oclock she glanced down noticed that shed unconsciously sketched his face on her notepad a bad sign she thought a very dangerous sign all right it was best to face complications headon ill see you tomorrow do me a favor if i can think of me tonight she doubted she had any choice in the matter bye in his office fourteen stories above the streets of baltimore phillip pushed back from his slick black desk ignored the beep on his computer that signaled an interoffice email and turned toward his wide window he loved his view of the city the renovated buildings the glimpses of the harbor the hustle of cars and people below but just now he didnt see any of it he literally couldnt get sybill out of his mind it was a new experience for him this continual tug on his thoughts and concentration it wasnt as if she was interfering with his routine he reflected he could work eat brainstorm do his presentations as skillfully as he had before hed met her but she was simply there he decided a tickle at the back of his mind through the day that inched forward to the front when his energies werent otherwise occupied he wasnt quite sure if he enjoyed having a woman demand so much of his attention particularly a woman who was doing very little to encourage him maybe he considered that light sheen of formality that cautious distance she tried to maintain a challenge he thought he could live with that it was just another of the entertaining and varied games men and women played but he worried that something was happening on a level hed never explored and if he was any judge she was just as unsettled by it as he its just like you ray said from behind him oh jesus phillip didnt spin around didnt goggle he simply shut his eyes pretty fancy office you got here been a while since i got in ray prowled the room casually pursing his lips at a blackframed canvas splashed with reds and blues not bad he decided brain stimulator id guess thats why you put it in your office get the juices going i refuse to believe that my dead father is standing in my office critiquing art well that wasnt what i wanted to talk about anyway but he paused by a metal sculpture in the corner but i like this piece too you always had highclass taste art food women he grinned cheerfully as phillip turned the woman youve got on your mind now for instance very highclass i need to take some time off id agree with you there youve been up to and over your head for months shes an interesting woman phillip theres more to her than you see or than she knows i hope when the times comes youll listen to her really listen to her what are you talking about he held up a hand palm out why am i asking you what youre talking about when youre not here im hoping that the pair of you will stop analyzing the steps and stages and accept what is ray shrugged slipped his hands into the pockets of his orioles fielders jacket but you have to go your own way its going to be hard theres not much time left before it gets a lot harder youll stand between seth and what hurts him i know that i want to tell you that you can trust her when its down to the sticking point phillip you trust yourself and you trust her a new chill skidded down his spine what does sybill have to do with seth its not for me to tell you that he smiled again but his eyes didnt match the curve of his lips you havent talked to your brothers about me you need to you need to stop feeling you have to control all the buttons youre good at it god knows but give a little he drew in a deep breath turned a slow circle christ your mother wouldve gotten a kick out of this place youve done a hell of a job with your life so far now his eyes smiled im proud of you i know youll handle what comes next you did a hell of a job with my life phillip murmured you and mom damn right we did ray winked keep it up when the phone rang ray sighed everything that happens needs to happen its what you do about it that makes the difference answer the phone phillip and remember seth needs you then there was nothing but the ringing of the phone and an empty office with his gaze locked on where his father had been phillip reached for the phone phillip quinn as he listened his eyes hardened he grabbed a pen and began to take notes on the detectives report on the most recent movements of gloria delauter chapter nine contents prev next shes in hampton phillip kept his eyes on seth as he relayed the information he watched cam lay a hand on the boys rigid shoulder an unspoken sign of protection she was picked up by the policeвђdrunk and disorderly possession shes in jail seths face was white as bone they can keep her in jail shes there now how long she would stay there phillip thought was another matter she probably has enough money to post bond you mean she can pay them money and theyll let her go beneath cams hand seth began to tremble no matter what i dont know but for now we know exactly where she is im going down to talk to her dont dont go there seth weve talked about this cam massaged the shaking shoulder as he turned seth to face him the only way were going to fix this for good is to deal with her i wont go back it was said in a whisper but a furious one ill never go back you wont go back ethan unhitched his tool belt laid it on the workbench you can stay with grace until anna gets home he looked at phillip and cam well go to hampton what if the cops say i have to what if they come while youre gone andвђ seth phillip interrupted the rising desperation he crouched took seths arms firmly you have to trust us seth stared back at him with ray quinns eyes and those eyes were glazed with tears and terror for the first time phillip looked into them and felt no shadowy resentment no doubts you belong with us he said quietly nothings going to change that on a long shuddering breath seth nodded he had no choice could do nothing but hope and fear well take my car phillip stated grace and anna will calm him down cam shifted restlessly in the passenger seat of phillips jeep its hell being that scared from the backseat ethan glanced at the speedometer and noted that phillip was pushing eighty not being able to do anything but wait and see shes fucked herself phillip said flatly getting arrested isnt going to help her custody case if she tries to make one she doesnt want the kid phillip spared a brief glance at cam no she wants money she isnt going to bleed any out of us but were going to get some answers were going to end it shed lie phillip thought he had no doubt that she would lie and wheedle and maneuver but she was wrong dead wrong if she thought she could get past the three of them to seth youll handle what comes next ray had said phillips hands tightened on the wheel he kept his eyes on the road hed handle it all right one way or the other with her head throbbing her stomach rolling sybill walked into the small county police station gloria had called her weeping and desperate begging her to send money for bail for bail sybill thought now fighting off a shudder gloria said it was a mistake she reminded herself a terrible misunderstanding of course what else could it have been shed nearly wired the money she still wasnt sure what had stopped her what had pushed her to get into her car and drive to help of course she told herself she only wanted to help im here for gloria delauter she told the uniformed officer who sat behind a narrow cluttered counter id like to see her if possible your name griffin dr sybill griffin im her sister ill post her bond but idвђ id like to see her can i see some id oh yes she fumbled in her purse for her wallet her hands were damp and shaky but the cop simply watched her with cool eyes until she offered identification why dont you have a seat he suggested then scraped back his own chair and slipped into an adjoining room her throat was dry and desperate for water she wandered the small waiting area with its grouping of hard plastic chairs in industrial beige until she found a water fountain but the water hit her tortured stomach like frigid balls of lead had they put her in a cell oh god had they actually put her sister in a cell is that where she would have to see gloria but under the sorrow her mind was working coolly pragmatically how had gloria known where to reach her what was she doing so close to st christophers why was she accused of having drugs that was why she hadnt wired the money she admitted now she wanted the answers first dr griffin she jolted turned to the officer with her eyes wide as a does caught in headlights yes can i see her now ill need to take your purse ill give you a receipt all right she handed it over to him signed the log where he indicated accepted the receipt for her belongings this way he gestured toward a side door then opened it into a narrow corridor on the left was a small room furnished only with a single table and a few chairs gloria sat at one her right wrist cuffed to a bolt sybills first thought was that theyd made a mistake this wasnt her sister theyd brought the wrong woman into the room this one looked far too old far too hard with her bony body the shoulders like points of wings the contrast of breasts pressing against a tiny snug sweater so hard that the nipples stood out in arrogant relief her frizzed mass of strawcolored hair had a dark streak shooting up the center deep lines dug in around her mouth and the calculation in her eyes was as sharp as those shoulders then those eyes filled that mouth trembled syb her voice cracked as she held out an imploring hand thank god youve come gloria she stepped forward quickly took that shaking hand in her own what happened i dont know i dont understand any of it im so scared she laid her head on the table and began to weep in loud racking sobs please instinctively sybill sat and draped her arm around her sister as she looked over at the cop can we be alone ill be right outside he looked back at gloria if he thought what a change this was from the screaming cursing woman whod been pulled in a few hours ago his face revealed nothing he stepped out shut the door and left them alone let me get you some water sybill rose hurried over to the water jug in the corner and filled a thin triangle of paper she cupped her hands around her sisters holding it steady did you pay the bail why cant we just go i dont want to stay here ill take care of it tell me what happened i said i dont know i was with this guy i was lonely she sniffed accepting the tissue that sybill passed her we were just talking for a while we were going to go out to lunch then the cops came up he ran away and they grabbed me it all happened so fast she buried her face in her hands they found drugs in my purse he must have put them there i just wanted someone to talk to all right im sure well straighten it all out sybill wanted to believe to accept and she hated herself because she couldnt not quite what was his name john john barlow he seemed so sweet sybill so understanding i was feeling really low because of seth she lowered her hands and her eyes were tragic i miss my little boy so much were you coming to st christophers gloria lowered her gaze i thought if i just had a chance to see him is that what the lawyer suggested theвђohвђ the hesitation was brief but it set off warning bells in sybills head no but lawyers dont understand they just keep asking for money whats your lawyers name ill call him he may be able to help straighten this out hes not from around here look sybill i just want to get out of here you cant believe how horrible it is that cop out there she nodded toward the door he put his hands on me sybills stomach began to pitch again what do you mean you know what i mean the first hint of annoyance sliced through he felt me up and he said hed be back later for more hes going to rape me sybill shut her eyes pressed her fingers to them when they were teenagers gloria had accused more than a dozen boys and men of molesting her including her high school counselor and principal even their own father gloria dont do this i said i would help you im telling you that bastard put his hands all over me as soon as im out of here im filing charges she crumpled the paper cup heaved it i dont give a damn if you believe me or not i know what happened all right but lets deal with now how did you know where to find me what a dark rage had been sliding over her brain and she had to struggle to remember her role what do you mean i didnt tell you where i was going where i would be i said i would contact you how did you know to call me at the hotel in st christophers it had been a mistake which gloria had realized shortly after making the call but shed been drunk and furious and damn it she didnt have the cash on her to make bail what she had left was safely tucked away until the quinns added to it she wasnt thinking when she called sybill but shed had time to think since the way to play sister sybill she knew was to tug on the guilt and responsibility strings i know you she offered a watery smile i knew that when i told you what happened with seth youd help i tried your apartment in new york which she had more than a week ago and when your answering service said you were out of town i explained how i was your sister and there was an emergency they gave me the number of the hotel i see it was plausible sybill decided even logical ill take care of the bail gloria but there are conditions yeah she gave a short laugh that sounds familiar i need the name of your lawyer so i can contact him i want to be brought up to date on the status of this situation with seth i want you to talk to me well have dinner and you can explain to me about the quinns you can explain to me why they claim ray quinn gave you money for seth the bastards are liars ive met them she said calmly and their wives ive seen seth its very difficult for me to equate what you told me with what ive seen you cant put everything all neat and tidy into reports christ youre just like the old man she started to get up snarled at the jerk of the cuff on her wrist the two eminent dr griffins this has nothing to do with my father sybill said quietly and everything i suspect to do with yours fuck this gloria twisted her lips into a vicious smile and fuck you the perfect daughter the perfect student the perfect goddamn robot just pay the fucking bail i got money put by youll get it back ill get my kid back without your help sister dear my kid you want to take the word of a bunch of strangers over your own flesh and blood you go right ahead you always hated me anyway i dont hate you gloria i never have but she could she realized as the ache began in her head and heart she was afraid she very easily could and im not taking anyones word over yours im just trying to understand deliberately gloria turned her face away so sybill wouldnt see her smile of satisfaction shed found the right button to push after all she decided i need to get out of here i need to get cleaned up she made certain her voice broke i cant talk about this anymore im so tired ill go deal with the paperwork im sure it wont take long as she rose gloria grabbed her hand again pressed it to her cheek im sorry im so sorry i said those things to you i didnt mean them im just upset and confused i feel so alone its all right sybill pulled her hand free and walked to the door on legs that felt as brittle as glass outside she downed two aspirin and chased them with antacids as she waited for the bail to be processed physically she thought gloria had changed the once astonishingly pretty girl had hardened toughened like dried leather but emotionally sybill feared she was exactly the same unhappy manipulative and disturbed child that had taken dark joy in disrupting their home she would insist that gloria agree to therapy she decided and if drug abuse was part of the problem she would see to it that gloria went into rehab certainly the woman shed just spoken with wasnt capable of taking custody of a young boy she would explore the possibilities of what was best for him until gloria was back on track she would need to see a lawyer of course first thing in the morning she would find a lawyer and discuss glorias rights and seths welfare she would have to face the quinns the thought of that had her stomach clutching again a confrontation was inevitable unavoidable nothing left her feeling more miserable and vulnerable than angry words and hateful emotions but she would be prepared she would take the time to think through what had to be said anticipate their questions and demands so she would have the proper responses she would above all remain calm and objective when she saw phillip walk into the building her mind went blank every ounce of color drained out of her face she stood frozen when his gaze whipped to hers when it narrowed and hardened what are you doing here sybill iвђ it wasnt panic that spurted through her but embarrassment shame i had business really he stepped closer while his brothers stood back in speculative silence he saw it in her faceвђguilt and more than a little fear what kind of business would that be when she didnt answer he angled his head whats gloria delauter to you dr griffin she ordered herself to keep her gaze steady her voice even shes my sister his fury was ice cold and deadly he balled his hands into his pockets to keep from using them in a way that was unforgivable thats cozy isnt it you bitch he said softly but she flinched as if he had struck her you used me to get to seth she shook her head but she couldnt voice the denial it was true wasnt it she had used him had used all of them i only wanted to see him hes my sisters son i had to know he was being cared for then where the hell have you been for the last ten years she opened her mouth but swallowed the excuses and explanations as gloria was led out lets get the hell out of here you buy me a drink syb gloria hitched a cherryred shoulder bag over her arm aimed an invitational smile at phillip well talk all you want hi there handsome she shifted her weight put a fist on her hip and let the smile spread to the other men hows it going under other circumstances the contrasts between the women might have been laughable sybill stood pale and quiet her glossy brown hair brushed smoothly back her mouth unpainted her eyes shadowed she exuded simple elegance in a tailored gray blazer and slacks and a white silk blouse while gloria offered sharp bones and overblown curves poured into black jeans and a snug tshirt that plunged between her breasts shed taken the time to repair her makeup and her lips were as slickly red as her handbag her eyes darkly lined she looked phillip decided like precisely what she was an aging whore looking for an angle she fished a cigarette out of a crumpled pack in her bag then wiggled it between her fingers got a light big guy gloria this is phillip quinn the formal introduction echoed hollowly in her ears his brothers cameron and ethan well well well glorias smile went sharp and ugly ray quinns wicked trio what the hell do you want answers phillip said shortly lets take this outside i got nothing to say to you you make one move i dont like ill start screaming she jabbed with the unlit cigarette theres a houseful of cops in here well see how you like spending some time in a cage gloria sybill put a restraining hand on her arm the only way to straighten this out is to discuss it rationally they dont look like they want a rational discussion to me they want to hurt me she shifted tacks skillfully throwing her arms around sybill clinging to her im afraid of them sybill please help me im trying to gloria no ones going to hurt you well find a place where we can all sit down and talk this through ill be right there with you im going to be sick she yanked back wrapped her arms around her stomach and dashed into the bathroom quite a performance phillip decided shes upset sybill linked her hands together twisted her fingers shes not in any shape to deal with this tonight he shifted his gaze back to sybills and it was ripe with derision do you want me to believe you bought that either youre incredibly gullible or you think i am she spent most of the afternoon in jail sybill snapped back anyone would be upset cant we discuss all of this tomorrow its waited this long surely it can wait one more day were here now cam put in well deal with it now are you going to go in there and bring her out or am i is that how you plan to resolve this by bullying her and me you dont want to get me started on how i plan to resolve this cam began and shrugged off ethans calming hand after what she put seth through theres nothing we can do to her that she hasnt earned sybill glanced uncomfortably behind her at the uniformed officer manning the desk i dont think any of us want to cause a scene in a police station fine phillip took her arm lets just step outside and cause one she held her ground partly out of fear partly common sense well meet tomorrow at whatever time is convenient for you ill bring her to my hotel you keep her out of st chris sybill winced when phillips fingers tightened on her arm all right where do you suggest ill tell you what i suggest cam began but phillip held up a hand princess anne you bring her into annas office at social services nine oclock that keeps everything official doesnt it everything aboveboard yes relief trickled through her i can agree to that ill bring her you have my word i wouldnt give you two cents for your word sybill phillip leaned in slightly but if you dont bring her well find her meanwhile if either of you tries to get within a mile of seth youll both be spending time in a cell he dropped her arm and stepped back well be there at nine she said resisting the urge to rub her aching arm then she turned and went into the bathroom to get her sister why the hell did you agree to that cam demanded as he stalked outside behind phillip weve got her here and now well get more out of her tomorrow bullshit phillips right as much as he detested it ethan accepted the change of plans we keep it in official surroundings we keep our heads its better for seth why so his bitch of a mother and his lying auntie have more time to put their heads together christ when i think sybill was alone with seth for a good hour today i want toвђ its done phillip snapped hes fine were fine with fury bubbling through his blood he slammed into the jeep and there are five of us they wont get their hands on seth he didnt recognize her ethan pointed out thats funny isnt it he didnt know who sybill was neither did i phillip murmured and shoved the jeep into gear but i do now sybills priority was to get gloria a hot meal keep her calm and question her carefully the little italian restaurant was only a few blocks from the police station and after a hurried glance sybill decided it would fill the bill my nerves are shot to hell gloria puffed greedily on a cigarette while sybill maneuvered into a parking spot the nerve of those bastards coming after me like that you know what theyd have done if id been alone dont you sybill only sighed and stepped out of the car you need to eat yeah sure gloria sniffed at the decor the minute they stepped inside it was bright and cheerful with colorful italian pottery thick candles striped tablecloths and decorative bottles of herbed vinegars id rather have a steak than wop food please forcing back irritation she took glorias arm and requested a table for two smoking section gloria added already pulling out another cigarette as they were led to the noisier bar area gin and tonic a double sybill rubbed her temples just mineral water thank you loosen up gloria suggested when the hostess left them alone you look like you could use a drink im driving i dont want one anyway she shifted away from the smoke gloria blew toward her face we have to talk seriously let me get some lubrication will you gloria smoked and scanned the men at the bar toying with which one shed pick up if she didnt have her deadly dull sister along christ sybill was a bore always had been she mused drumming her fingers on the table and wanting her goddamn drink but she was useful and always had been if you played her right laid on plenty of tears she came through she needed a hammer with the quinns and sybill was the perfect choice upstanding fucking respectable dr griffin gloria you havent even asked about seth what about him ive seen him several times spoken with him ive seen where hes living where he goes to school i met some of his friends gloria clicked into the tone of her sisters voice adjusted her attitude how is he she worked up a shaky smile did he ask about me hes fine really wonderful actually hes grown so much since i saw him ate like a horse gloria remembered and was always growing out of his clothes and shoes like she was made of fucking money or something he didnt know who i was what do you mean gloria snatched up her drink the minute it was set on the table you didnt tell him no i didnt sybill glanced up at the waitress we need a few more minutes before ordering so you were poking around incognito gloria let out a long hoarse laugh you surprise me syb i thought it best that i observe the situation before changing the dynamics gloria snorted now that sounds just like you man you dont change observe the situation before changing the dynamics she repeated in her imitation of a snooty voice christ the situation is those sons of bitches have my kid they threatened me and god knows what theyre doing to him i want some dough to work on getting him back i sent you money for the lawyer sybill reminded her gloria clinked ice against her teeth as she drank and the five thousand had come in handy she thought now how the hell could she have known how fast the money shed bled out of ray would slip away she had expenses didnt she shed wanted to have some fun for a change should have demanded twice as much from him she decided well shed get it out of those bastards hed raised you got the money i wired for your lawyer didnt you gloria gloria took another deep drink yeah well lawyers suck you dry dont they hey she called out signaling to the waitress and pointing at her empty glass hit me again will you if you drink like that and you dont eat youre going to be sick again like hell gloria sneered as she snatched up her menu she didnt intend to stick her finger down her throat again once was more than enough hey they got steak florentine i can handle that remember when the old man took us off to italy that summer all those hotlooking dudes on motorbikes holy god i had a hell of a time with that guy what was his name carlo or leo or whatever i snuck him into the bedroom you were too shy to stay and watch so you slept in the parlor while we did the deed half the night she snatched up her fresh glass lifted it in toast god bless the italians ill have the linguini with pesto and the insalada mista give me the steak bloody gloria held out the menu without looking at the waitress skip the rabbit food been a while hasnt it syb what four five years six sybill corrected its been just over six since i came home to find you and seth gone along with a number of my personal possessions yeah sorry about that i was messed up its tough raising a kid on your own moneys always tight you never told me very much about his father whats to tell old news she shrugged it off and rattled the ice in her glass all right then lets deal with current events i need to know everything that happened i need to understand it in order to help you and to know how to handle our meeting with the quinns tomorrow the gin and tonic thudded onto the table what meeting were going in to social services tomorrow morning to air out the problems discuss the situation and try to reach a solution the hell i am the only thing they want is to fuck me over keep your voice down sybill ordered sharply and listen to me if you want to straighten yourself out if you want your son back this has to be done calmly and legally gloria you need help and im willing to help you from what i can see youre not in any shape to take seth back right now whose side are you on his it came out of her mouth before she realized that it was the absolute truth im on his side and i hope that puts me on yours we need to resolve what happened today i told you i was set up fine it still needs to be resolved the courts arent going to be very sympathetic to a woman whos facing charges of possession great why dont you get on the witness stand and tell them how worthless i am thats what you think anyway thats what all of you always thought please stop it lowering her voice to a murmur sybill leaned over the table im doing everything i know how to do if you want to prove to me you want to make this work you have to cooperate you have to give something back gloria nothings ever been free with you were not talking about me ill pay your legal fees ill talk to social services ill work to make the quinns understand your needs and your rights i want you to agree to rehab for what you drink too much she sneered deliberately gulping down more gin ive had a rough day you had drugs in your possession i said they werent fucking mine youve said that before sybill said coolly now you get counseling you get therapy you get rehab ill arrange it ill foot the bill ill help you find a job a place to stay as long as its your way gloria tossed back the rest of her drink therapy you and the old man used that to solve everything those are the conditions so youre running the show jesus order me another drink ive gotta piss she swung her purse over her shoulder and strode past the bar sybill sat back and closed her eyes she wasnt going to order gloria another drink not when her sisters words were already beginning to slur that would be another bitter little battle she imagined the aspirin shed taken had failed miserably pain was drumming at both temples in a sick and consistent rhythm across her forehead was a squeezing band of iron she wanted nothing quite so much as to stretch out on a soft bed in a dark room and sink into oblivion he despised her now it made her ache with regret and shame to remember the contempt shed seen in phillips eyes maybe she deserved it at that moment she simply couldnt think clearly enough to be sure but she was sorry for it more than that she was furious with herself for letting him and his opinion of her come to matter so much in such a short time shed known him for only a matter of days and had never never intended to allow his emotions or hers to become entangled a casual physical attraction a few mutually enjoyable hours in each others company that was all it was supposed to be how had it become more but she knew when hed held her when hed sent her blood swimming with those long intimate kisses shed wanted more now she who had never considered herself particularly sexy or overly emotional was a frustrated pitiful wreck because one man had jiggled a lock he was no longer interested in opening there was nothing to be done about it she reminded herself certainly considering the circumstances she and phillip quinn had never been meant to develop a personal relationship of any kind if they managed to have one now it would be because of the child they would both be adult coldly polite andвђin the end she hopedвђreasonable for seths sake she opened her eyes as the waitress served her salad and hated the pity she saw on a strangers face can i get you anything else more water no im fine thank you you could take that she added indicating glorias empty glass her stomach rebelled at the thought of food but she ordered herself to pick up her fork for five minutes she toyed with the salad poking at it while her gaze drifted regularly toward the rear of the restaurant she must be ill again sybill thought wearily now she would have to go back hold glorias head listen to her whining and mop up the mess one more pattern battling both resentment and the shame that trickled from it she rose and walked back to the ladies room gloria are you all right there was no one at the sinks and no answer from any of the stalls resigned sybill began to nudge doors open gloria in the last stall she saw her own wallet lying open on the closed lid of the toilet stunned she snatched it up flipped through it her various identifications were there and her credit cards but all her cash was gone along with her sister chapter ten contents prev next with her mind jumbled with pain her hands unsteady and her system begging to shut down for the night sybill keyed open her hotel door if she could just get to her migraine medication to a dark room to oblivion she would find a way to deal with tomorrow she would find a way to face the quinns alone with the shameful sting of failure they would believe shed helped gloria run away how could she blame them she was already a liar and a sneak in their eyes in seths and she admitted in her own with slow deliberation she turned the bolt fixed the safety lock then leaned back against the door until she could will her legs to move again when the light switched on she stifled a yelp and covered her eyes in defense youre right about the view phillip said from her terrace doors its spectacular she lowered her hand forced her mind to engage hed removed his jacket and tie she noted but otherwise he looked just as he had when hed confronted her at the police station polished urbane and bitterly angry how did you get in his smile was cold turning his eyes a hard chilly gold the color of an icy winter sun you disappoint me sybill id have thought your research on your subject would have included the fact that one of my formative skills was breaking and entering she stayed where she was supported by the door you were a thief among other things but enough about me he stepped forward to settle on the arm of the sofa like a casual friend making himself comfortable for a chatty visit you fascinate me your notes are incredibly revealing even to a layman you read my notes her gaze swung toward the desk and her laptop she couldnt quite find outrage through the prickly blanket of pain enveloping her head but she knew it must be there you had no right to come in here uninvited to break into my computer and read my work so calm phillip thought and rose to help himself to a beer from her mini bar what kind of woman was she as far as im concerned sybill all bets are off you lied to me you used me you had it all worked out didnt you when you waltzed into the boatyard last week your agenda was set he couldnt stay calm the longer she stood staring at him with no expression on her face the higher his temper spiked infiltrate the enemy camp he slammed the beer onto the table the crack of glass on wood split through her head like an axe observe and report pass information to your sister and if being with me helped you slide more smoothly behind the lines you were willing to make the sacrifice would you have slept with me no she pressed a hand to her head and nearly gave in to the need to slip to the floor and curl into a ball i never meant for thingsвђ i think youre lying he crossed to her taking her arms and drawing her up to her toes i think youd have done anything just one more object lesson right and with the added benefit of helping your bitch of a sister bleed us for more money seth doesnt mean any more to you than he does to her just a means to an end for both of you no thats notвђi cant think the pain was excruciating if he hadnt been holding her up she would have gone to her knees and begged iвђwell discuss it tomorrow im not well you and gloria have that in common too im not falling for it sybill her breath began to hitch her vision to blur im sorry i cant stand it i have to sit down please i have to sit down he focused in past his fury her cheeks were dead pale her eyes glassy her breath coming fast and uneven if she was faking illness he decided hollywood had missed a major star muttering an oath he pulled her to the sofa she all but melted onto the cushions too ill to be embarrassed she closed her eyes my briefcase my pills are in my briefcase he picked up the soft black leather case beside the desk riffled through it and found the prescription bottle imitrex he looked over at her she had her head back her eyes closed and her hands fisted in her lap as if she could center the pain there and squeeze it to death major migraine drugs yes i get them now and again she had to focus she ordered herself had to relax but nothing she did eased her past the vicious pain i should have had them with me if id had them with me it wouldnt have gone this far here he handed her a pill and water hed taken from the mini bar thank you she nearly bobbled the water in her rush it takes a while but its better than the injection she closed her eyes again and prayed he would just leave her alone have you eaten what no ill be all right she looked fragile terrifyingly so part of him thought she deserved to hurt was tempted to leave her with her misery but he picked up the phone and asked for room service i dont want anything just be quiet he ordered up soup and tea then began to prowl the room how could he have misjudged her so completely pegging people quickly and accurately was one of his most finely honed skills hed seen an intelligent interesting woman a classy one with humor and taste but beneath the glossy surface she was a liar a cheat and an opportunist he nearly laughed hed just described the boy hed worked half his life to bury in your notes you say you havent seen seth since he was about four why did you come here now i thought i could help who the hope that the pain would begin to recede gave her the strength to open her eyes i dont know i thought i could help him and gloria you help one you hurt the other i read your notes sybill are you going to try to tell me you care about him the subject appears healthy hes not a fucking subject hes a child its necessary to be objective its necessary to be human it was a dart sharp enough to strike her heart and make it ache as well im not very good with emotions reactions and behavioral patterns are more my forte than feelings id hoped to be able to keep a certain distance from the situation to analyze it to determine what was best for all involved i havent been doing a good job of it why didnt you do anything before he demanded why didnt you do anything to analyze the situation when seth was with your sister i didnt know where they were then she let out a breath and shook her head it was no time for excuses and the man staring at her with those cold eyes wouldnt accept them in any case i never seriously tried to find out i sent her money now and again if she contacted me and asked for it my connection with gloria was usually unproductive and unpleasant for christs sake sybill were talking about a little boy here not your views on sibling rivalry i was afraid to get attached she snapped out the one time i did she took him away he was her child not mine there was nothing i could do about it i asked her to let me help but she wouldnt shes been raising him all alone my parents have disinherited her my mother wont even acknowledge that she has a grandson i know gloria has problems but it cant be easy for her he simply stared at her are you serious shes had no one to depend on sybill began then closed her eyes again as a knock sounded on the door im sorry but i dont think i can eat yes you can phillip opened the door for the room service waiter directed him to set the tray on the table in front of the sofa he dispatched him quickly with cash and a generous tip try the soup he ordered you need something in your system or the medications going to end up making you nauseous my mother was a doctor remember all right she spooned it up slowly telling herself it was just more medicine thank you im sure youre not in the mood to be kind its harder for me to kick you when youre down eat up sybill and well go a round or two she sighed the leading edge of the headache was dulling she could handle it now she thought and him as well i hope youll at least attempt to understand my point of view on this gloria called me a few weeks ago she was desperate terrified she told me shed lost seth lost him phillip let out a short sarcastic laugh oh thats rich i thought abduction at first but i was able to get some of the details out of her she explained that your family had him had taken him from her she was almost hysterical so afraid shed never get him back she didnt have the money to pay her lawyer she was fighting an entire family an entire system all alone i wired her the money for the lawyer and i told her id help that she should wait until i contacted her as her system began to settle again she reached for one of the rolls in the basket beside her bowl and broke it open i decided to come and see the situation for myself i know gloria doesnt always tell the entire truth that she can slant things to suit her position but the fact remains that your family had seth and she didnt thank god for that she stared at the bread in her hand wondered if she could manage to put it in her mouth and chew i know youre providing him with a good home but shes his mother phillip she has a right to keep her own son he watched her face carefully measured the tone of her voice he didnt know whether to be furious or baffled by both you actually believe that dont you color was seeping back into her cheeks her eyes had cleared and now met his steadily what do you mean you believe that my family took seth that we took advantage of some poor single mother down on her luck and snatched the kid that she wants him back that she even has a lawyer working on custody you do have him sybill pointed out thats right and hes exactly where he belongs and is going to stay let me give you some facts she blackmailed ray father and she sold seth to him i know you believe that butвђ i said facts sybill less than a year ago seth was living in a set of filthy rooms on the block in baltimore and your sister was on the stroll on the stroll god where do you come from she was hooking this isnt a whore with a heart of gold here this isnt a desperate downonherluck unwed mother doing anything she has do to survive and keep her child fed she was keeping her habit fed she only shook her head slowly side to side even as part of her mind accepted everything he said you cant know all this yes i can know it because i live with seth ive talked with him ive listened to him her hands went icy she lifted the pot of tea to warm them poured some slowly into a cup hes just a boy he could have misunderstood sure i bet thats it he just misunderstood when she brought a john up to the place when she got so stoned she sprawled on the floor and he wondered if she was dead he just misunderstood when she beat the hell out of him when she was feeling testy she hit him the cup rattled into the saucer she hit him she beat him no controversial yet civilized spanking dr griffin fists belts the back of the hand have you ever had a fist in the face he held his up to hers figure it out proportionately this would be about right comparing a grown womans fist to say a five sixyearold boy put liquor and drugs into that fist and it comes faster and harder ive been there he angled his fist away studied it my mother preferred smackвђto the uninitiated thats heroin if she missed her fix you learned to stay far out of her way i know just what it is to have a vicious fuckedup female take her fists to me his gaze whipped back to sybills your sister wont ever have the chance to use them on seth again iвђshe needs to go into therapy i neverвђ he was fine when i saw him if id known she was abusing himвђ i havent finished hes a goodlooking kid isnt he some of glorias clients thought so the color that had come back to her cheeks fell away no shaking her head she pushed away from him and staggered to her feet no i dont believe that thats hideous thats impossible she didnt do anything to stop it he ignored the pale cheeks and fragility now and pushed hard she didnt do a goddamn thing to protect him seth was on his own there he fought them off or hid sooner or later there would have been one he couldnt fight off or hide from thats not possible she couldnt she couldвђespecially if it earned her a few extra bucks it took months with us before he could stand to be touched in even the most casual way he has nightmares still and if you say his mothers name it makes you sick to see the fear that comes into his eyes thats your situation dr griffin god how can you expect me to accept all that to believe shes capable of that she pressed a hand to her heart i grew up with her ive known you less than a week and you expect me to accept this horror story this vileness as fact i think you believe it he said after a moment i think under it all youre smart enough and lets say observant enough to know the truth she was terrified if it is the truth why didnt the authorities do anything why wasnt he helped sybill have you lived on that smooth plateau so long that you really dont know what lifes like on the street how many seths there are out there the system works some of the time for the few and the lucky it didnt work for me it didnt work for seth ray and stella quinn worked for me and just under a year ago my father paid your sister the first installment on a tenyearold boy he brought seth home he gave him a life a decent one she saidвђshe said he took seth yeah he took him ten thousand the first time a couple of other payments of about the same then last march she wrote him a letter demanding a lumpsum payment a hundred fifty thousand cash and shed walk away a hundred andвђ appalled she broke off struggled to concentrate on verifiable facts she wrote a letter ive read it it was in the car with my father when he was killed he was on his way back from baltimore hed cleaned out most of his bank accounts id have to guess shes gone through a big chunk of it by now she wrote us demanding more money just a few months ago she turned away walked quickly to the terrace doors and flung them open the need for air was urgent and she gulped it in like water im supposed to accept that gloria has done all of this and her primary motive is money you sent her money for her lawyer whats his name why hasnt our lawyer been contacted by him she squeezed her eyes shut it wouldnt help to feel betrayed she reminded herself she evaded the question when i asked her obviously she doesnt have a lawyer and its doubtful she ever intended to consult one well youre slowвђthe sarcasm rang clearlyвђbut you do catch on i wanted to believe her we were never close as children and that has to be as much my fault as hers id hoped i could help her and seth i thought this was the way so she played you i felt responsible my mother is so unbending on this shes angry that i came here she has refused to acknowledge gloria since she ran off at eighteen gloria claimed to have been molested by the counselor at our school she was always claiming to have been molested they had a terrible row my mother and she and gloria was gone the next day shed taken some of my mothers jewelry my fathers coin collection some cash i didnt hear from her for nearly five years those five years were a relief she hated me sybill said quietly and continued to stare out at the lights on the water always as long as i can remember it didnt matter what i did whether i fought with her or stepped back and let her have her way she detested me it was easier for me to keep my distance i didnt hate her i simply felt nothing and when i brush everything else aside right now its exactly the same i cant feel anything for her it must be a flaw she murmured maybe its genetic with a weak smile she turned around again it might make an interesting study one day you never had a clue did you of what she was doing no so much for my renowned observational skills im sorry phillip im so terribly sorry for what ive done and havent done i promise you i didnt come here to harm seth and i give you my word ill do whatever i can to help if i can go into social services in the morning speak with anna your family if youll allow it id like to see seth try to explain we wont be taking him to annas office were not letting gloria near him she wont be there his eyes flickered i beg your pardon i dont know where she is defeated she spread her hands i promised id bring her i meant to you just let her walk goddamn it i didntвђnot intentionally she sank down onto the sofa again i took her to a restaurant i wanted to get her a meal talk to her she was agitated and drinking too much i was annoyed with her i told her we were going to straighten everything out that we were going to have a meeting in the morning i made ultimatums i should have known better she didnt like it but i didnt see what she could do about it what sort of ultimatums that she would get counseling go into rehab that she would get help get herself straightened out before she tried to gain custody of seth she went to the ladies room and when she didnt come back out i went in looking for her she lifted her hands let them fall uselessly i found my wallet she must have taken it out of my purse she left me my credit cards she added with a wry smile shed know i would cancel them straight off she only took the cash its not the first time shes stolen from me but it always surprises me she sighed shrugged it off i drove around for nearly two hours hoping id find her but i didnt and i dont know where she is i dont know what she intends to do she messed you over pretty good didnt she im an adult i can take care of myself and im responsible for myself but sethвђ if even a part of what youve told me is trueвђ hell hate me i understand that and ill have to accept it id like the chance to talk to him thatll be up to him fair enough i need to see the files the paperwork she linked her fingers together i realize you can require me to get a court order but id like to avoid that id process this better if i had it all in black and white its not as simple as black and white when youre dealing with peoples lives and feelings maybe not but i need facts documentation reports once i have them if im persuaded that seths best interest is to remain with your family through legal guardianship or adoption ill do whatever i can to help that happen she had to push now she told herself she had to push to make him give her another chance just one more chance im a psychologist and im the birth mothers sister id think my opinion would bear weight in court he studied her objectively details he thought he was the man who handled the details after all those she was adding would only help settle everything the way he wanted it settled i imagine it would and ill discuss it with my family but i dont think you get it sybill she isnt going to fight for seth shes never intended to fight for him shes just trying to use him to get more money shes not going to get that either not another dime so im superfluous maybe i havent decided he rose jingling the change in his pockets as he paced how are you feeling better fine thank you im sorry to have fallen apart like that but the migraine was a fullblown one you get them often a few times a year im usually able to get to the medication at onset so theyre not too bad when i left this evening i was distracted yeah bailing your sister out of jail would be a distraction he glanced back at her with mild curiosity how much did it take to spring her bail was set at five thousand well id say you can kiss that goodbye most likely the money isnt important what is he stopped turned toward her she looked exhausted and disconcertingly fragile still an unfair advantage was still an advantage he decided and pressed what is important to you sybill finishing what ive started you may not need my help but i dont intend to walk away until ive done what i can if seth doesnt want to see you or speak to you he wont thats bottom line hes had enough she straightened her shoulders before they could slump regardless of whether he agrees to see or speak with me i intend to stay until the legalities are settled you cant force me to leave phillip you can make it difficult for me uncomfortable but you cant make me leave until im satisfied yeah i can make it difficult for you i can make it damn near impossible for you and im considering just that he leaned over ignoring her instinctive jerk and caught her chin firmly in his hand would you have slept with me under the circumstances i believe thats moot not to me it isnt answer the question she kept her eyes level with his that was a matter of pride though she felt she had little of that or her dignity left intact yes when his eyes flared she jerked her chin away but not because of seth or gloria i would have slept with you because i wanted you because i was attracted to you and when i was around you for any length of time my priorities became blurred your priorities became blurred he rocked back on his heels dipped his hands into his pockets jesus youre a case why do i find that snotty attitude intriguing i dont have a snotty attitude you asked a question i answered it honestly and youll note in the past tense now ive got something else to consider if i want to change that to present tense dont say its moot sybill he warned when she opened her mouth im bound to take that as a dare if we end up in bed tonight neither one of us is going to like ourselves in the morning i dont like you very much right now were on the same curve there honey he jingled his change again then shrugged well keep the meeting at annas office in the morning as far as im concerned you can see all the paperwork including your sisters blackmail letters as far as seth goes i dont make any promises if you try to go around me and my family to get to him youll regret it dont threaten me im not im giving you facts its your family who likes threats his smile was sharp dangerous and without an ounce of humor the quinns make promises and they keep them im not gloria no but we still have to see just who you are nine oclock he added oh and dr griffin you may want to look over your own notes again when you do it might be interesting psychologically speaking to ask yourself why you find it so much more rewarding to observe than to participate get some sleep he suggested as he walked to the door youre going to want to be sharp tomorrow phillip going with the impulse of temper she rose and waited for him to turn around with the door open at his back isnt it fortunate that circumstances changed before we made the mistake of sex he angled his head both impressed and amused that shed dared such a dangerous parting shot darling im counting my blessings he closed the door with a quiet snap chapter eleven contents prev next seth needed to be told there was only one way to do it and that was straight out as a family ethan and grace would bring him home as soon as aubrey was settled with the babysitter we shouldnt have let her out of our sight cam paced the kitchen hands jammed in his pockets gray eyes hard as flint god knows where she took off to and instead of having answers instead of straightening her ass out weve got nothing thats not entirely true anna brewed coffee it wouldnt help to settle nerves she thought but everyone would want it ill have a police report for the file you couldnt very well drag her out of the station house cameron and force her to talk to you it wouldve been a hell of a lot more satisfying than watching her walk momentarily perhaps but it remains in seths best interest and ours to handle everything in an official bythebook manner how do you think seths going to feel about that he whirled and the leading edge of his temper whipped out at his wife and his brother do you think hes going to feel its in his best interest that we had gloria and did nothing you did do something because she understood his frustration anna kept her voice calm you agreed to meet her in my office if she doesnt keep the appointment its another strike against her she wont be anywhere near social services tomorrow phillip began but sybill will and were supposed to trust her cam snapped out all shes done so far is lie you didnt see her tonight phillip said evenly i did yeah and we know what part of your anatomy youre looking with bro stop it anna stepped quickly between them as two pairs of fists curled two pairs of eyes flashed youre not going to beat each other brainless in this house she slapped a hand on cams chest then phillips found them both immovable its not going to help anyone if you rip pieces off each other we need a united front seth needs it she added pushing harder when she heard the front door open now both of you sit down sit down she hissed it the image of those ready fists swinging over her head adding both urgency and authority to her voice with their gazes still heated and locked both men dragged out chairs and sat anna had time for one relieved breath before seth came in trailed by two dogs with cheerfully swatting tails hey whats up his cheerful grin vanished immediately a lifetime of living with glorias wildly swinging moods had taught him to gauge atmosphere the air in the kitchen was simmering with tension and temper he took a step back then froze as ethan came in behind him and laid a hand on his shoulder coffee smells good he said mildly and the hand on seths shoulder remained part restraint part support ill get some cups grace hurried past them to the cupboard she knew shed be better off with her hands busy seth do you want a coke what happened his lips felt stiff and his hands cold its going to take a little while to explain it all anna walked to him put her hands on his cheeks the first order of business she determined was to erase the fear that had come into his eyes but you dont have to worry did she ask for more money again is she coming here did they let her out of jail no come sit down well explain everything she shook her head at cam before he could speak and locked her eyes with phillips as she guided seth toward the table he had more firsthand information she decided it was best that it come from him where the hell was he supposed to start phillip dragged a hand through his hair seth do you know anything about your mothers family no she used to tell me stuff one day shed say how her parents were rich really rolling in it but they died and some slick lawyer stole all the money another day shed say how she was an orphan and shed run away from this foster home because the father tried to rape her or how her mother was this movie star who gave her up for adoption so she wouldnt lose her career she was always changing it his gaze shifted around the room as he spoke trying to read faces who cares he demanded ignoring the soft drink grace set in front of him who the hell cares anyway there wasnt anybody or shedve tapped them for money there is somebody and it seems she did tap them for money off and on phillip kept his voice quiet and calm as a person would when soothing a frantic puppy we found out today that she has parents and a sister i dont have to go with them alarm rang in his head as he surged out of his chair i dont know them i dont have to go with them no you dont phillip took seths arm but you need to know about them i dont want to his gaze flew to cams pleaded i dont want to know you said i could stay you said nothing was going to change that it made cam sick to see that desperation but he pointed to the chair you are staying nothing is going to change that sit down you never solve anything by running look around seth ethans tone was soft the voice of reason youve got five people here standing with you he wanted to believe it he didnt know how to explain that it was so much easier to believe in lies and threats than in promises what are they going to do how did they find me gloria called her sister a few weeks ago phillip began when seth sat again you dont remember her sister i dont remember anybody seth muttered and hunched his shoulders well it seems she spun a tale for the sister told her that wed stolen you from her shes full of shit seth anna drilled him with a look that made him squirm she conned the sister out of some money for a lawyer phillip continued said she was broke and desperate that wed threatened her she needed the money to get you back seth wiped his mouth with the back of his hand she bought it she must be an idiot maybe or maybe shes a soft touch either way the sister didnt buy the whole package she wanted to check things out for herself so she came to st chris shes here seths head whipped up i dont want to see her i dont want to talk to her you already have sybill is glorias sister seths darkblue eyes widened and the angry flush faded from his cheeks she cant be shes a doctor she writes books nonetheless she is when cam and ethan and i drove down to hampton we saw her you saw her you saw gloria yeah we saw her hold on phillip laid a hand over seths rigid one sybill was there too she was posting bail so it all came out shes a liar seths voice began to hitch just like gloria shes a damn liar let me finish we agreed to meet them both in the morning in annas office we have to get the facts seth he added when the boy snatched his hands free its the only way were going to fix this for good im not going you can decide that for yourself we dont think glorias going to show i saw sybill just a little while ago gloria had given her the slip shes gone relief and hope struggled to beat back fear shes gone again it looks that way she took money out of sybills wallet and split phillip glanced over at ethan judged his brothers reaction to the news as angry resignation sybill will be in annas office in the morning i think it would be better if you went in with us talked to her there i dont have anything to say to her i dont know her i dont care about her she should just go away and leave me alone she cant hurt you seth i hate her shes probably just like gloria only she pretends to be different phillip thought of the fatigue the guilt the misery hed seen on sybills face but he said thats for you to decide too but you need to see her and hear what she has to say to do that she said shed only seen you once gloria came to new york and you stayed at sybills place for a little while you were about four i dont remember his face went stony with stubbornness we stayed in a lot of places seth i know it doesnt seem fair grace reached over to give the hands he had balled into fists on the table a quick reassuring squeeze but your aunt may be able to help well all be there with you cam saw the refusal in seths eyes and leaned forward quinns dont walk away from a fight he paused until seths gaze shifted to his until they win it it was pride and the fear of not living up to the name theyd given him that stiffened his shoulders ill go but nothing she says is going to mean dick to me with eyes hot and brooding he turned to phillip did you have sex with her seth annas voice was sharp as a slap but phillip only raised a hand maybe his first instinct was to tell the boy it was none of his business but he knew how to think past the quick retort and study the whole no i didnt seth gave a stiff shrug thats something then you come first phillip saw the surprise flicker in seths eyes at the statement i made a promise that you would so you do nothing and no one changes that beneath the warm thrill seth felt a greasy tug of shame sorry he mumbled it and stared down at his own hands fine phillip sipped at the coffee that had gone cold in his cup well hear what she has to say in the morning then shell hear what we have to say what you have to say well go from there she didnt know what she was going to say she felt sick inside the dregs of a migraine hangover fuzzed her brain and her nerves were stretched to the breaking point at the prospect of facing the quinns and seth they had to hate her she doubted very much they could feel more contempt for her than she felt for herself if what phillip had told her was trueвђthe drugs the beatings the menвђshe had by the sin of omission left her own nephew in hell there was nothing they could say to her that was worse than what she had said to herself during the endless sleepless night but she was sick with anticipation of what was to come as she pulled into the small parking lot attached to social services it was bound to become ugly she thought as she tilted her rearview mirror and carefully applied lipstick hard words cold looksвђand she was so pitifully vulnerable to both she could stand against them she told herself she could maintain that outward calm no matter what was happening to her insides shed learned that defense over the years remain aloof and detached and survive she would survive this and if she could somehow ease seths mind whatever wounds she suffered would be worth it she stepped out of the car a cool and composed woman in a elegantly simple silk suit the color of mourning her hair was swept up in a sleek twist her makeup was subtle and flawless her stomach was raw and burning she stepped inside the lobby already the waiting area contained a scattering of people an infant whimpered restlessly in the arms of a woman whose eyes were glazed with fatigue a man in a flannel shirt and jeans sat with his face grim and his fisted hands dangling between his knees two other women sat in a corner mother and daughter sybill deduced the younger woman had her head cradled on the others shoulder and wept silently out of eyes blackened by fists sybill turned away dr griffin she told the receptionist i have an appointment with anna spinelli yes shes expecting you down this hall second door on your left thank you sybill closed her hand around the strap of her purse and walked briskly to annas office her heart plummeted to her stomach when she reached the doorway they were all there waiting anna sat behind the desk looking professional in a navy blazer her hair pinned up she was scanning an open file grace sat with her hand swallowed by ethans cam stood at the narrow window scowling while phillip sat flipping through a magazine seth sat between them staring down at the floor his eyes curtained by his lashes his mouth set his shoulders hunched she gathered her courage started to speak but phillips eyes flicked up and found hers the one long look warned her he hadnt softened overnight she ignored her trembling pulse and angled her head in acknowledgment youre prompt dr griffin he said and instantly all eyes were on her she felt scalded and pinned all at once but she took the last step over the threshold into what she fully understood was quinn turf thank you for seeing me oh were looking forward to it cams voice was dangerously soft his hand sybill noted had gone to seths shoulder in a gesture that was both possessive and protective ethan would you close the door anna folded her hands on the open file please sit down dr griffin it wouldnt be sybill and anna here all the friendly female connection that came from cozy kitchens and simmering pots was gone accepting that sybill took the vacant seat facing annas desk she set her purse in her lap clutched it with boneless fingers and smoothly casually crossed her legs before we begin id like to say something she took a slow breath when anna nodded in agreement sybill shifted and looked directly at seth he kept his eyes on the floor i didnt come here to hurt you seth or to make you unhappy im sorry that i seem to have done both if living with the quinns is what you want what you need then i want to help see that you stay with them seth lifted his head now and stared at her with eyes that were stunningly adult and harsh i dont want your help but you may need it she murmured then turned back to anna sybill saw speculation there and what she hoped was an open mind i dont know where gloria is im sorry i gave my word i would bring her here this morning its been a very long time since id seen her and iвђ i hadnt realized how much shedвђ how unstable she is unstable cam snorted at the term thats a rich one she contacted you anna began shooting her husband one warning look yes a few weeks ago she was very upset claimed that seth had been stolen from her and that she needed money for her lawyer who was going to fight a custody case she was crying nearly hysterical she begged me to help her i got as much information as i could who had seth and where he was living i sent her five thousand dollars sybill lifted her hands i realized yesterday when i spoke with her that there was no lawyer gloria has always been a clever actress id forgotten that or i chose to forget that were you aware that she had a drug problem noвђagain not until yesterday when i saw her and spoke with her it became clear that shes not capable at this time of handling the responsibility of a child she doesnt want the responsibility of a child phillip commented so you said sybill responded coolly you indicated that she wanted money im aware that money is important to gloria im also aware that shes not stable but its difficult for me to believe without proof that shes done all that you claim you want proof cam stepped forward fury all but visible in waves around him you got it sugar show her the letters anna cam sit down annas order was firm before she turned back to sybill would you recognize your sisters handwriting i dont know i suppose i might i have a copy of the letter found in raymond quinns car when he was killed and one of the letters sent to us more recently she took them out of the file and passed them over the desk into sybills hands words and phrases leaped out at her burned into her mind quinn im tired of playing nickel and dime you want the kid so bad then its time to pay for himвђ a hundred and fifty grands a pretty good bargain for a goodlooking boy like seth oh god was all sybill could think dear god the letter to the quinns after rays death was no better ray and me had an agreement if youre set on keeping himвђ im going to need some moneyвђ sybill willed her hands to remain steady she took this money professor quinn drew out cashiers checks to gloria delauter twice for ten thousand dollars once for five anna spoke clearly and without emotion he brought seth delauter to st christophers late last year the letter you have is postmarked march tenth the following day professor quinn arranged to cash out his bonds some stock and he drew large sums of cash out of his bank account on march twelfth he told ethan he had business in baltimore on his return he was killed in a singlecar accident there were just over forty dollars in his wallet no other money was found he promised i wouldnt have to go back seth said dully he was decent he promised and she knew hed pay her she asked for more from you from all of you and miscalculated phillip leaned back studying sybill nothing showed he noted but her pallor she wont bleed us dr griffin she can threaten all she wants but she wont bleed us and she wont get seth you also have a copy of the letter i wrote to gloria delauter anna stated i informed her that seth was under the protection of social services that an investigation by this office was under way on charges of child abuse if she comes into the county shell be served with a restraining order and a warrant she was furious grace spoke up she called the house right after she got annas letter she threatened and demanded she said she wanted money or shed take seth i told her she was wrong grace looked over held seths gaze hes ours now shed sold her son was all sybill could think it was just as phillip had said all of it was just as hed said you have temporary guardianship itll be permanent shortly phillip informed her we intend to see to that sybill laid the papers back on annas desk inside she was cold brutally cold but she linked her fingers lightly on top of her purse and spoke evenly to seth did she hit you what the hell do you care answer the question seth phillip ordered tell your aunt what life was like with her sister okay fine he bit the words off but his sneer was wobbly around the edges sure she knocked me around when she felt like it if i was lucky she was too drunk or stoned for it to hurt much i could usually get away anyhow he shrugged as if it didnt matter in the least sometimes she got me by surprise maybe she hadnt been able to turn enough tricks to score so shed wake me up and pound on me a while or shed cry all over me she wanted to turn away from that image as shed turned away from the desperate strangers in the waiting area instead she kept her gaze steady on seths face why didnt you tell anyone find someone to help you like who was she stupid seth thought the cops she told me what the cops would do id end up in juvie and some guy would use me like some of her johns wanted to they could do whatever they wanted once i was inside as long as i was out i could get away she lied to you anna said softly while sybill tried to find words any words the police would have helped she knew sybill managed about the men who tried toвђ touch you sure she thought it was funny hell when shes stoned she thinks most everything is funny its when shes drunk that she gets mean could this monster the boy spoke of so casually be her sister howвђ do you know why she decided to contact professor quinn no i dont know anything about it she got wired up one day started talking about hitting a gold mine she took off for a few days she left you alone why that should horrify her after everything else shed heard sybill couldnt say hey i can take care of myself when she came back she was flying said i was finally going to be of some use she had some moneyвђreal money because she went out and scored a lot of dope without hooking she stayed stoned and happy for days then ray came he said i could come with him at first i thought he was like the guys she brought home but he wasnt i could tell he looked sad and tired his voice had changed she noted softened so she thought he grieves too then she saw the ripe disgust come into his eyes she came on to him seth said shortly and he got real upset he didnt yell or anything but he got real hard in the eyes he made her leave he had money with him and he said if she wanted it to leave so she took it and went he told me he had a house by the water and a dog and that i could live there if i wanted and no one would mess with me you went with him he was old seth said with a shrug i figured i could get away from him if he tried anything but you could trust ray he was decent he said id never have to go back to the way things were and i wont no matter what i wont go back and i dont trust you his eyes were adult again his voice controlled and derisive because you lied you pretended to be decent all you were doing was spying on us youre right she thought it the hardest thing shed ever done or would ever have to do to meet those scornful eyes in a childs face and admit her own sins you have no reason to trust me i didnt help you i could have all those years ago when she brought you to new york i didnt want to see it was easier not to and when i came home one day and both of you were gone i didnt do anything about that either i told myself it wasnt my concern that you werent my responsibility that wasnt just wrong it was cowardly he didnt want to believe her didnt want to hear the regret and the apology in her voice he balled his hands into fists on his knees it doesnt have anything to do with you now either shes my sister i cant change that because it hurt to see the contempt in his eyes she turned back to anna what can i do to help can i make a statement to you talk to your lawyer im a licensed psychologist and glorias sister i would assume that my opinion might carry some weight toward the guardianship im sure it would anna murmured it wont be easy for you i have no feelings for her im not proud to say that but its the simple truth i feel nothing toward her whatsoever and the sense of responsibility i thought i should feel to her is over as much as he may wish it otherwise im seths aunt i intend to help she rose and scanned the faces in the room while her stomach pitched and rolled im terribly sorry for all of this i realize an apology is useless i have no excuse for what i did reasons but no excuses its perfectly clear that seth is where he belongs where hes happy if youll give me a moment to gather my thoughts ill give you a statement she walked out without hurry and continued to the outside where she could find air well she went about it wrong but she seems level right now cam got up paced off some of his energy in the crowded office she sure doesnt shake easily i wonder anna murmured she too was a trained observer and instinct told her there was a great deal more going on under that placid surface than any of them might guess having her on our side will without question help it might be best if you left the two of us alone so i can talk with her phillip youll want to call the lawyer explain the situation and see if he wants to depose her yeah ill take care of it he frowned thoughtfully at the fingers drumming on his knee she had a picture of seth in her filofax what anna blinked at him i went through her things before she got back to the hotel last night he smiled a little then shrugged as his sisterinlaw closed her eyes seemed like the thing to do at the time shes got this snapshot of seth when he was little tucked in her filofax so what seth demanded so it was the only picture i found anywhere its interesting he lifted his hands dropped them again on another path it could be that sybill knows something about glorias connection to dad since we cant question gloria we ought to ask her seems to me ethan said slowly that whatever she knows wouldve come from gloria be tough to believe it i think shed tell us what she knows he continued but what she knows might not be fact we dont know fact or fiction phillip pointed out until we ask her ask me what steadier determined now to finish it out sybill stepped back into the room and closed the door quietly at her back the reason gloria hit on our father phillip rose so their eyes were level the reason she knew he would pay to protect seth seth said he was a decent man sybills gaze roamed the faces of the men i think youre proof of that decent men dont have adulterous affairs with women half their age then walk away from a child conceived from that affair bitterness coated phillips voice as he took another step toward sybill and theres no way youre going to convince us that ray slept with your sister behind our mothers back then walked away from his son what without realizing it sybill shot a hand out to grip his arm as much in shock as to keep her balance as she reeled from it of course he didnt you told me you didnt believe that gloria and your fatherвђ others do but thatsвђwhere did you get the idea that seth was his son his son by gloria its easy enough to hear it in town if you keep your ears open phillip narrowed his eyes at her face its something your sister planted she claimed he molested her then she blackmails him sells him her son he looked back at seth into ray quinns eyes i say its a lie of course its a lie its a horrible lie desperate to do at least this one thing right and well she went to seth crouched in front of him she wanted badly to take his hand but resisted her impulse when he leaned away from her ray quinn wasnt your father seth he was your grandfather glorias his daughter his lips trembled and those deepblue eyes shimmered my grandfather yes im sorry she didnt tell you so sorry you didnt know before heвђ she shook her head straightened i didnt realize there was confusion about this i should have i only learned about it myself a few weeks ago she took her seat again prepared herself ill tell you everything i know chapter twelve contents prev next it was easier now almost like a lecture sybill was used to giving lectures on social topics all she had to do was divorce herself from the subject and relay information in a clear and cohesive manner professor quinn had a relationship with barbara harrow she began she put her back to the window so that she could face all of them as she spoke they met at american university in washington i dont have a great many of the details but what i do know indicates that he was teaching there and she was a graduate student barbara harrow is my mother glorias mother my father phillip said your mother yes nearly thirtyfive years ago i assume they were attracted to each other physically at least my motherвђ she cleared her throat my mother indicated that she believed he had a great deal of potential that he would rise up the ranks in academia quickly status is an essential requirement to my mothers contentment however she found herself disappointed in hisвђ what she saw as his lack of ambition he was content to teach apparently he wasnt particularly interested in the social obligations that are necessary for advancement and his politics were too liberal for her tastes she wanted a rich important husband cueing in quickly phillip raised his eyebrows and she discovered he wasnt going to be it thats essentially true sybill agreed in a cool steady voice thirtyfive years ago the country was experiencing unrest its own internal war between youth and establishment colleges were teeming with minds that questioned not only an unpopular war but the status quo professor quinn it would seem had a lot of questions he believed in using the brain cam muttered and in taking a stand according to my mother he took stands sybill managed a small smile often unpopular with the administration of the university he and my mother disagreed strongly on basic principles and beliefs at the end of the term she went home to boston disillusioned angry and she was to discover pregnant bullshit sorry cam said shortly when anna hissed at him but its bullshit theres no way he would have ignored responsibility for a kid no way in hell she never told him sybill folded her hands as all eyes swung back to her she was furious perhaps she was frightened as well but she was furious to find herself pregnant by a man shed decided was unsuitable she considered terminating the pregnancy shed met my father and they had clicked he was suitable cam concluded i believe they suited each other her voice chilled they were her parents damn it she had to be left with something my mother was in a difficult and frightening position she wasnt a child she was nearly twentyfive but an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy is a wrenching episode for a woman of any age in a moment of weakness or despair she confessed all of it to my father and he offered her marriage he loved her sybill said quietly he must have loved her very much they were married quickly and quietly she never went back to washington she never looked back dad never knew he had a daughter ethan covered graces hand with his no he couldnt have gloria was three nearly four when i was born i cant say what the relationship between her and my parents was like in those early years i know that later on she felt excluded she was difficult and temperamental demanding certainly she was wild certain standards of behavior were expected and she refused to meet them it sounded so cold sybill thought now so unyielding in any case she left home when she was still a teenager later i discovered that both of my parents and myself sent her money independently of each other she would contact one of us and plead demand threaten whichever worked i wasnt aware of any of this until gloria called me last month about seth sybill paused a moment until she could compose her thoughts before i came here i flew to paris to see my parents i felt they needed to know seth was their grandchild and as far as i knew hed been taken away from gloria and was living with strangers when i told my mother what had happened and she refused to become involved to offer any assistance i was stunned and angry we argued sybill let out a short laugh she was surprised enough by that i think to tell me what ive just told you gloria had to know phillip pointed out she had to know ray quinn was her father or shed never have come here yes she knew a couple of years ago she went to my mother when my parents were staying in dc for a few months i can assume it was an ugly scene from what my mother told me gloria demanded a large sum of money or shed go to the press to the police to whoever would listen and accuse my father of sexual abuse my mother of collusion in it none of that is true sybill said wearily gloria always equated sex with power and acceptance she routinely accused men particularly men in positions of authority of molesting her in this instance my mother gave her several thousand dollars and the story ive just told you she promised gloria that it was the last penny she would ever see from her the last word she would ever speak to her my mother rarely very rarely goes back on a promise of any kind gloria would have known that so she hit on ray quinn instead phillip concluded i dont know when she decided to find him it may have stewed in her mind for a time now she would consider this the reason she was never loved never wanted never accepted as she felt she deserved to be i imagine she blamed your father for that someone else is always to blame when gloria has difficulties so she found him phillip rose from his chair to pace and true to form demanded money made accusations threatened only this time she used her own son as the hammer apparently im sorry i should have realized you werent aware of all the facts i suppose i assumed your father had told you more of it he didnt have time cams voice was cold and bitter he told me he was waiting for some information ethan remembered that hed explain everything once he found out he must have tried contacting your mother phillip pinned sybill with a look he would have wanted to speak with her to know i cant tell you that i simply dont know i know phillip said shortly he would have done what he felt was right for seth first because hes a child but he would have wanted to help gloria to do that he needed to talk to her mother find out what had happened it would have mattered to him i can only tell you what i know or whats been told to me sybill lifted her hands let them fall my family has behaved badly it was weak she knew all of us she said to seth i apologize for myself and for them i dont expect you toвђ what she wondered and let it go ill do anything i can to help i want people to know seths eyes swam when he lifted them to her face i want people to know he was my grandfather theyre saying things about him and its wrong i want people to know im a quinn sybill could only nod if this was all he asked of her she would make certain she gave it drawing a breath she looked at anna what can i do youve made a good start already anna glanced at her watch she had other cases and another appointment scheduled in ten minutes are you willing to make the information youve given us official and public yes i have an idea how to start that ball rolling the embarrassment factor couldnt be weighed sybill reminded herself she could and would live with the whispers and the speculative looks that were bound to come her way once she followed through on annas suggestion shed typed up her statement herself spending two hours in her room choosing the right words and phrasing the information had to be clear the details of her mothers actions of glorias even her own when it was proofed and printed out she didnt hesitate she took the pages down to the front desk and calmly requested that they be faxed to annas office ill need the originals back she told the clerk and i expect a reply by return fax ill take care of this for you the young freshfaced clerk smiled professionally before she slipped into the office behind the desk sybill closed her eyes briefly no turning back now she reminded herself she folded her hands composed her features and waited it didnt take long and there was no mistaking from the wide eyes of the clerk that at least part of the transmission had been scanned do you want to wait for the reply dr griffin yes thank you sybill held out a hand for the papers nearly smiling as the clerk jolted then quickly passed them across the desk are you ah enjoying your stay cant wait to pass on what you read can you sybill thought typical and totally expected human behavior its been an interesting experience so far well excuse me a moment the clerk dashed into the back room again sybill was just releasing a sigh when her shoulders tensed she knew phillip was behind her before she turned to face him i sent the fax to anna she said stiffly im waiting for her reply if she finds it satisfactory ill have time to go to the bank before it closes and have the document notarized i gave my word im not here as a guard dog sybill i thought you could use a little moral support she all but sniffed im perfectly fine no youre not to prove it to both of them he rested a hand on the rigid cords in her neck but you put on a hell of a show i prefer to do this alone well you cant always get what you want as the song says he glanced over with an easy smile his hand still on sybills nape as the clerk hurried out with an envelope hi there karen hows it going the clerk blushed clear to the hairline her eyes darting from his face to sybills fine umвђ heres your fax dr griffin thank you without flinching sybill took the envelope and tucked it into her bag youll bill my account for the service yes of course see you around karen smoothly phillip slid his hand from sybills neck to the small of her back to guide her across the lobby shell have told her six best friends by her next break sybill murmured at the very least the wonders of small towns the quinns will be the hot topic of discussion over a number of dinner tables tonight by breakfast the gossip mill will be in full swing that amuses you sybill said tightly it reassures me dr griffin traditions are meant to reassure i spoke to our lawyer he continued as they crossed the waterfront gulls swooped dogging a workboat on its way to dock the notarized statement will help but hed like to take your deposition early next week if you can manage it ill make an appointment in front of the bank she stopped and turned toward him hed changed into casual clothes and the wind off the water ruffled his hair his eyes were concealed behind shaded lenses but she wasnt certain she cared to see the expression in them it might look less as if im under house arrest if i go in alone he merely lifted his hands palms out and stepped back she was a tough nut he decided when she strode into the bank but he had a feeling that once cracked there was something soft even delectable inside he was surprised that someone as intelligent as highly trained in the human condition as she was couldnt see her own distress couldnt or wouldnt admit that there had been something lacking in her own upbringing that forced her to build walls hed nearly been fooled he mused into believing she was cold and distant and untouched by the messier emotions he couldnt be sure what it was that insisted he believe differently maybe it was nothing more than wishful thinking but he was determined to find out for himself and soon he knew that making her family secrets accessible and so informally public would be humiliating for her and perhaps painful but shed agreed without condition and was following through without hesitation standards he thought integrity she had them and he believed that she had heart as well sybill offered a thin smile as she came back out well thats the first time ive seen a notarys eyes nearly pop out of her head i think that shouldвђ the rest of her babbling statement was lost as his mouth rushed to cover hers she lifted a hand to his shoulder but her fingers only curled into the soft material of his sweater you looked like you needed it he murmured and skimmed a hand over her cheek regardlessвђ hell sybill weve already got them talking why not add to the mystery her emotions were rocking making it difficult for her to hold on to any threads of composure ive no intention of standing here making a spectacle of myself so if youllвђ fine lets go somewhere else ive got the boat the boat i cant go out on the boat im not dressed for it i have work i need to think she told herself but he was already pulling her to the dock a sail will do you good youre starting on another headache the fresh air should help i dont have a headache only the nasty simmering threat of one and i dont want toвђ she nearly yelped so stunned was she when he simply plucked her off her feet and set her down on the deck consider yourself shanghaied doc quickly competently he freed the lines and leaped aboard i have a feeling you havent had nearly enough of that kind of treatment in your short sheltered life you dont know anything about my life or what ive had if you start that engine im going toвђ she broke off grinding her teeth as the motor putted to life phillip i want to go back to my hotel now hardly anybody ever says no to you do they he said it cheerfully as he gave her a firm nudge onto the port bench just sit back and enjoy the ride since she didnt intend to leap overboard and swim back to shore in a silk suit and italian shoes she folded her arms it was his way of paying her back she supposed by taking away her freedom of choice asserting his will and his physical dominance typical she turned her head to stare out over the light chop she wasnt afraid of him not physically he had a tougher side than shed originally thought but he wouldnt hurt her and because he cared for seth deeply shed come to believe he needed her cooperation she refused to be thrilled when he hoisted the sails the sound of the canvas opening itself to the wind the sight of the sun beating against the rippling white the sudden and smooth angling of the boat meant nothing to her she insisted she would simply tolerate this little game of his give him no reaction undoubtedly he would grow weary of her silence and inattention and take her back here he tossed something making her jump she looked down and saw the sunglasses that had landed neatly in her lap suns fierce today even if the temperatures cooling indian summers around the corner he smiled to himself when she said nothing only slid the sunglasses primly on her nose and continued to stare in the opposite direction we need a good hard frost first he continued conversationally when the leaves start to turn the shoreline near the house is a picture golds and scarlets you get that deep blue sky behind them and the water mirrorbright that spice of fall on the air and you could start to believe theres no place else on the planet youd ever want to be she kept her mouth firmly shut tightened the fold of her arms across her breasts phillip merely tucked his tongue in his cheek even a couple of avowed urbanites like you and i can appreciate a fine fall day in the country seths birthdays coming up out of the corner of his eye he saw her head jerk around her mouth tremble open she shut it again but this time when she turned away her shoulders where hunched defensively oh she felt all right phillip mused there were plenty of messy emotions stewing inside that cool package of hers we thought wed throw him a party have some of his pals over to raise hell you already know grace bakes a hell of a chocolate cake weve got his present taken care of but just the other day i saw these art supplies in this shop in baltimore not a kids setup a real one chalk pencils charcoal brashes watercolors paper palettes its a specialty shop a few blocks from my office somebody who knew something about art could breeze in there and pick out just the right things hed intended to do so himself but he saw now that his instincts to tell her about it had been true she was facing him now and though the sun flashed off her sunglasses he could see from the angle of her head that he had her full attention he wouldnt want anything from me youre not giving him enough credit maybe youre not giving yourself enough either he trimmed the sails caught the wind and saw the instant she recognized the curve of trees along the shore she got unsteadily to her feet phillip however you may feel about me right now it cant help the situation for you to push me at seth again so soon im not taking you home he scanned the yard as they passed seths at the boatyard with cam and ethan in any case you need a distraction sybill not a confrontation and for the record i dont know how i feel about you at the moment ive told you everything i know yeah i think youve given me the facts you havent told me how you feel how those facts affect you personally emotionally it isnt the issue im making it an issue were tangled up here sybill whether we like it or not seths your nephew and hes mine my father and your mother had an affair and were about to no she said definitely were not he turned his head long enough to shoot her a glittering look you know better than that youre in my system and i know when a womans got me in hers and were both old enough to control our more basic urges he stared at her another moment then laughed hell we are and its not the sex that worries you its the intimacy he was hitting all the targets it didnt anger her nearly as much as it frightened her you dont know me im beginning to he said quietly and im someone else who finishes what i start im coming about his voice was mild now watch the boom she stepped out of the way sat she recognized the little cove where they had shared wine and pate only a week ago she thought dully now so much had changed everything had changed she couldnt be here with him couldnt risk it the idea of handling him now was absurd still she could do nothing but try coolly she eyed him casually she smoothed her hand over the sophisticated twist the wind had disordered caustically she smiled what no wine this time no music no neat gourmet lunch he dropped the sails secured the boat youre scared youre arrogant and you dont worry me now youre lying while the boat swayed gently underfoot he stepped forward and took the sunglasses from her i worry you quite a bit you keep thinking you have me pegged then i dont follow the script i imagine most of the men youve let hover around your life have been fairly predictable easier for you is this your definition of a distraction she countered it fits my definition of a confrontation youre right he pulled his own sunglasses off tossed them aside well analyze later he moved quickly she knew he was capable of lightning motion but hadnt expected him to snap from cynic to lover in the blink of an eye his mouth was hot hungry and hard on hers his hands gripped her arms pressing her against him so that as the heat and the need poured out she couldnt tell if it came from him or from herself hed spoken no less than the truth when he told her she was in his system whether she was poison or salvation didnt seem to matter she was in there and he couldnt stop the flow he jerked her back so that their lips parted but their faces remained close his eyes were as gold and powerful as the flare of the sun you tell me you dont want me you dont want this tell me and mean it and it stops here iвђ no impatient suffering he shook her until her gaze lifted to his again no you look at me and say it shed already lied and the lies weighed on her like lead she couldnt bear another this will only complicate things make them more difficult unmistakable triumph flashed into those tawny eyes damn right it will he muttered just now i dont give a damn kiss me back he demanded and mean it she couldnt stop herself this kind of raw wicked need was new to her and left her defenseless her mouth met his just as hungry now just as desperate and the low primal moan that escaped was an echo to the beat of desire between her legs she stopped thinking found herself swamped and spinning with sensations emotions yearnings the kiss roughened teetered toward pain as his teeth scraped and nipped she clutched at his hair gasping for air shaking with shock as that skillful mouth streaked down her throat and sent wild chills over her skin for the first time in her life she surrendered utterly to the physical and craved the taking he pulled at her jacket tugging the soft silk off her shoulders and tossing it heedlessly aside he wanted flesh the feel of it under his hands the taste of it in his mouth he yanked the slim ivory shell over her head and filled his hands with her trembling lacecovered breasts her skin was warmer than the silk and somehow smoother with one impatient flick he opened her bra then dragged it aside and satisfied his need to taste the sun blinded her even with her eyes tightly shut the strength of it pounded on her lids she couldnt see only feel that busy almost brutal mouth devoured her those rough and demanding hands doing as they pleased the whimper in her throat was a scream in her head now now now fumbling she dragged at his sweater finding the muscle and scars and flesh beneath as he yanked her skirt down her hips her stockings ended with thin bands of stretchy lace high on her thighs another time he might have appreciated the mix of practicality and femininity but now he was driven to possess and he thrilled darkly at her stunned gasp when he ripped aside the thin triangle blocking him from her before she could draw the next breath he plunged his fingers into her and shot her violently over the edge she cried out shocked staggered at that vicious slap of heat it sliced through her without warning sending her flying flailing oh god phillip when her head dropped weakly on his shoulder her body going from springtaut to limp he swept her off her feet and pressed her down on one of the narrow benches the blood was pounding in his head his loins screamed for release his heart hammered like a dull axe against his ribs his breath was ragged his vision focused on her face like a laser as he freed himself his fingers dug into her hips as he lifted and opened them and he plunged hard and deep so that his long long groan melted into hers she closed around him a tight hot glove moved under him a trembling eager woman breathed his name a breathless aching sigh he drove into her again again strong steady strokes that she rose to meet her hair escaped its pins flowed like rich mink he buried his face in it lost in her scent in her heat in the sheer shimmering glory of a woman aroused beyond reason her nails dug into his back her cry muffled against his shoulder as she came her muscles clamped around him owned him destroyed him he was as limp as she wrecked struggling to fill his burning lungs with air beneath him her body continued to quake the aftershock of hard satisfying sex when his vision cleared he could see the three pieces of her pretty businesswomans suit scattered along the deck and one black high heel it made him grin even as he shifted just enough to nip lightly at her shoulder i usually try for more finesse he said slyly he skimmed a hand down to toy with the thin lace at the top of her stocking experimenting with textures oh youre full of surprises dr griffin she was floating somewhere just above reality she couldnt seem to open her eyes to move her hand what at the dreamy distant sound of her voice he lifted his head to study her face her cheeks were flushed her mouth swollen her hair a tumbling mass as an objective observation i have to conclude youve never been ravished before there was amusement in his tone and just enough male arrogance to snap her back to earth she opened her eyes now and saw the sleepy smile of victory in his youre heavy she said shortly okay he shifted sat up but pulled her up and around until she straddled his lap youre still wearing your stockings and one of your shoes he grinned and began to knead the muscles of her tight little butt christ thats sexy stop it the heat was pouring back a combination of embarrassment and fresh desire let me up i havent finished with you yet he dipped his head circled his tongue lazily around her nipple youre still soft and warm tasty he added flicking his tongue over her stiffened nipple sucking lightly until her breathing thickened yet again i want more so do you her body arched back beautifully fluid as he trailed his mouth up to the hammering pulse in her neck oh yes yes she wanted more but this time he promised itll take a little longer on a yielding moan she lowered her mouth to his i guess theres time the sun was angled low when he shifted her yet again her body felt golden and bruised energized and exhausted shed had no idea she could claim such a sexual appetite and now that she did she hadnt a clue what she would do about it we have to discussвђ she frowned at herself draped an arm over her body she was half naked and damp from him and more confused than shed ever been in her life weвђthisвђcant continue not right this minute he agreed even i have my limitations i didnt meanвђ this was just a diversion as you said something we both apparently needed on a physical level and nowвђ shut up sybill he said it mildly but she caught the edge of annoyance it was a hell of a lot more than a diversion and well discuss it to pieces later he scooped the hair out of his eyes studied her she was just beginning to feel awkward he realized uneasy with being naked and with the situation so he smiled right now were a mess so theres only one thing to do before we get dressed and head in what still smiling he pulled off her shoe then scooped her up into his arms just this he said and tossed her over the side she managed one scream before she hit what surfaced was a furious woman with tangles of wet hair in her eyes you son of a bitch you idiot i knew it he stepped onto the gunwale and laughed like a loon i just knew youd be gorgeous when youre angry he dived in to join her chapter thirteen contents prev next no one had ever treated her the way phillip quinn had treated her sybill couldnt decide what she thought of that much less what to do about it hed been rough careless demanding he had in his own words ravished herвђand more than once though she couldnt claim to have put up even what could remotely be termed a struggle it had been a long way from a civilized seduction never in her life had she slept with a man shed known for such a short time to do so was reckless potentially dangerous and certainly irresponsible even factoring in the overwhelming and unprecedented chemistry between them it was foolish behavior worse than foolish she admitted because she very much wanted to be reckless with him again she would have to consider the matter carefully as soon as she could get her mind off her body and the incredible pleasure it had experienced under those fast takecharge hands now he was sailing her back to the waterfront at st christophers completely at ease with himself and with her she never would have guessed hed just spent more than an hour engaged in wild frantic sex if she hadnt been a party to it there was no doubt in her mind that what theyd done would further complicate an already horribly complicated situation both of them would have to be coldly sensible now and carefully practical she did her best to tidy her damp tangled hair as the wind whipped at it conversation she decided to bridge the gap between sex and sensibility how did you get the scars which ones he tossed the question over his shoulder but he thought he knew most women wanted to know on your chest they look surgical mmm long story this time he threw a smile back with the look ill bore you with it tonight tonight oh he just loved it when her brows buckled together forming that little concentration line between them we have a date remember but iвђ hmmm i confuse the hell out of you dont i annoyed she slapped at the hair that insisted on blowing over her eyes and you enjoy that darling i cant begin to tell you how much you keep trying to slip me into one of your slots sybill and ill keep sliding back out again you figured on a fairly safe onedimensional urban professional who likes his wine aged and his women cultured but thats only part of the picture as he entered the harbor he dropped the sails switched to motor first glance at you i have to figure wellbred welleducated careeroriented city woman who likes her wine white and her men at a safe distance but thats only part of the picture too he cut the engine let the boat bump gently at dock gave her hair a friendly tug before he climbed out to secure the lines i think well both be well entertained while we uncover the rest of the canvas a continuation of a physical relationship isвђ inevitable he finished and offered her a hand lets not waste time or energy pretending otherwise we can call it basic chemistry for now he tugged her to him the minute her feet hit the dock and proved his point with one long fiery kiss it works for me your family wont approve family approvals important to you of course i dont discount it either normally this wouldnt be any of their business in this case it is it bothered him more than a little but its my family and my concern not yours this may sound hypocritical at this point but i dont want to do anything else that will hurt or disturb seth neither do i but im not going to let a tenyearold take charge of my personal life relax sybill he skimmed his fingers over her jaw this isnt the montagues and the capulets im hardly thinking of you as romeo she said so dryly that he laughed and kissed her again you might darling if i put my mind to it but for now lets just be who we are youre tired he rubbed his thumb gently under her eye youve got thin skin sybill the shadows show go take a nap we can make do with room service later withвђ ill bring the wine he said cheerfully and leaped back into the boat ive got a bottle of chateau olivier ive been wanting to sample he shouted over the motor no need to dress up he added with a wicked grin as he maneuvered the boat away from the dock and out of earshot she wasnt sure what she would have shouted at him if shed lost what was left of her control instead she stood on the dock in her wrinkled but elegant silk suit her hair a damp mess and her dignity as shaky as her heart cam recognized the signs a fast sail on a breezy afternoon might relax a man loosen his muscles clear his head but he only knew one thing that put that lazy satisfied gleam in a mans eyes he recognized that gleam in his brothers eyes when phillip slid up to the dock to toss him the lines you son of a bitch was his first thought he caught the stern line yanked it taut you son of a bitch phillip only lifted his eyebrows hed been expecting that reaction though not quite so quickly hed already ordered himself to hold on to his temper to explain his position always a friendly welcome at the quinns i figured you were past the stage where you thought with your dick not quite as calm as hed planned to be phillip stepped off the boat and stood facing his brother he recognized the signs too cam was spoiling for a fight actually i tend to let my dick think for itself though we often agree youre either crazy or stupid or you just dont give a damn a kids life is in the balance here his peace of mind his trust nothings going to happen to seth im doing everything i can to make sure of that oh i get it you fucked her for his sake phillips hands shot out and before the bright fury fully registered he had them gripped on cams jacket now their faces were close and both were warrior hard you were tearing up the sheets with anna last spring how much were you thinking about seth when you had her under you cams fist rammed up under phillips guard the blow rocked his head back but didnt loosen his hold instinct blanked out reason as he shoved cam back and prepared to tear in he swore viciously when ethan clamped an arm around his throat from behind cool off ethan ordered on more of a sigh than a snarl both of youвђor ill toss you in until you do he tightened his hold on phillips windpipe just enough to show he meant it and scowled at cam get ahold of yourself damn it seths had a rough day you want to add to it no i dont want to add to it cam said bitterly this one doesnt give a good damn but i do my relationship with sybill and my concern for seth are two separate matters like hell let go of me ethan because phillips tone was cool and deliberate ethan released him you know cam i dont remember you being so interested in my sex life since we both had our sights set on jenny malone were not in high school anymore pal no were not and youre not my keeper either of you he added shifting so that he could look at both of them he would explain himself because it mattered because they mattered ive got feelings for her and im going to take the time to figure out what they are ive made a lot of changes in my life over the last few months and ive gone along with what the two of you wanted but goddamn it im entitled to a personal life i wouldnt argue with that phil ethan glanced toward the house hoping seth was busy with his homework or his drawings and not spying out the window i dont know how seths going to feel about this part of your personal life theres something none of you are taking into consideration sybill is seths aunt thats exactly what i am taking into consideration cam shot back shes glorias sister and she came in here on a lie she came in here believing a lie it was an important distinction phillip thought a vital distinction did you read the statement she faxed to anna cam hissed between his teeth hooked his thumbs in his pockets yeah i saw it what do you think it cost her to put that down in black and white to know everybody in town would be talking about it about her within twentyfour hours phillip waited a beat noting that the muscle in cams jaw relaxed fractionally how much more do you want her to pay im not thinking about her im thinking about seth and shes the best defense weve got against gloria delauter you think shell stand up to it ethan wondered when push comes to shove yeah i do he needs his family all his family thats what dad would want he told meвђ catching himself phillip frowned out over the dark water cam pursed his lips exchanged a look with ethan and nearly smiled been feeling a little odd lately phillip im fine maybe youre stressed out some since hed only gotten in one punch cam felt entitled to enjoy himself i thought i saw you talking to yourself a couple of times i dont talk to myself maybe you think youre talking to somebody who isnt there he did smile now widely and wickedly stress is a killer eats at the mind ethan didnt quite swallow a chuckle and phillip glared at him you got something to say about the state of my mental health wellвђ ethan scratched at his chin youve been looking a little tense lately for christs sake im entitled to look a little tense he threw out his arms as if to encompass the world that too often weighed on his shoulders i put in ten twelve hours a day in baltimore then come down here and sweat like a goddamn galley slave in the boatyard thats when im not frying my brains over the books and the bills or playing housewife at the grocery store or making sure seth doesnt slide out of his homework always was bitchy cam mumbled you want bitchy phillip took one threatening step forward but this time cam grinned and spread his hands ethanll just toss you off the dock me i dont feel like a swim just now first few times with me i thought i was dreaming confused unsure if he wanted to punch cam or just sit down for a while phillip looked back at ethan what the hell are you talking about i thought we were discussing your mental health ethans tone was mild conversational now it was good to see him hard to know youd have to let him go again but it was worth it a chill danced up phillips spine and he put his suddenly unsteady hands safely in his pockets maybe we should be talking about your mental health we figured when it was your turn youd head for the therapists couch cam grinned again or aruba i dont know what youre talking about yes you do ethan spoke calmly then settled down on the dock legs dangling to take out a cigar its your turn looks like he took us in the same order he took us in symmetry cam decided dropping down beside ethan hed have liked the symmetry of it i talked to him the first time the day i met anna he thought back to it the way hed seen her cross the back lawn with that knockout face and that ugly suit i guess thats a kind of symmetry too the chill was still dancing tapping fast now up and down phillips spine what do you mean talked to him had a conversation cam plucked the cigar out of ethans mouth and helped himself to a puff of course i figured id cracked he glanced up smiled you figure youve cracked phil no ive just been working too hard shit drawing pictures coming up with jingles big deal kiss ass but with a sigh he sat on the dock are the two of you trying to tell me youve talked to dad the one who died in march the one we buried a few miles from here in an easy gesture cam passed phillip the cigar you trying to tell us you havent i dont believe in that sort of thing doesnt much matter what you believe when it happens ethan pointed out and took back his cigar last time i saw him was the night i asked grace to marry me he had a bag of peanuts christ jesus phillip murmured i could smell them the same way i can smell this cigar smoke the water cams leather jacket when people die thats it they dont come back phillip paused a moment waiting until the cigar came back down the line to him did youвђtouch him cam angled his head did you he was solid he couldnt be its either that ethan pointed out or were all crazy we barely had time to say goodbye and no time to understand cam let out a breath his grief had eased and softened he bought us each a little more time thats what i think he and mom bought us all time when they made us quinns he couldnt think about it phillip decided not now at any rate it must have ripped him when he found out he had a daughter hed never known hed have wanted to help her save her ethan murmured hed have seen it was too late for her but not for seth cam concluded so hed have done whatever he could do to save seth his grandson phillip watched an egret soar then slide silently into the dark and he was no longer cold hed have seen himself in the eyes but he wouldve wanted answers ive been thinking about that the logical step would have been for him to try to locate glorias mother have her confirm it it would have taken time cam considered it shes married shes living in europe and from what sybill said she wasnt interested in contacting him and he ran out of time phillip concluded but now we know and now we make it stick she hadnt meant to sleep sybill indulged in a long hot shower then wrapped herself in a robe with the intention of adding to her notes she ordered herself to drum up the courage to call her mother to speak her mind and demand a written corroboration of her own notarized statement she did neither instead she fell face down on the bed closed her eyes and escaped the knocking at the door pulled her out of sleep into groggy she stumbled out of bed fumbled for the light switch with her mind still fuzzy she walked through the parlor and barely had the presence of mind to check the peephole she let out a selfdirected annoyed sigh as she flipped off the locks phillip took one look at her tousled hair sleepy eyes and practical navy terry robe and smiled well i did tell you not to dress up im sorry i fell asleep distracted she pushed at her hair she hated being mussed particularly when he looked so fresh and alert and gorgeous if youre tired ill take a rain check no iвђ if i sleep any more now ill end up wide awake at three am i hate hotel rooms at three am she stepped back to let him in ill just get dressed stay comfortable he suggested and used his free hand to cup the nape of her neck and bring her forward for a casual kiss ive already seen you naked and a very appealing sight it was it appeared she decided that her dignity was still just out of reach im not going to claim that was a mistake good he set the wine he carried on her coffee table but she said with what she considered admirable patience neither was it wise were both sensible people speak for yourself doc i stop feeling sensible every time i get a whiff of you what is that you wear she leaned back when he leaned in to sniff at her phillip sybill and he laughed how about if i attempt to be civilized and not cart you off to bed until youre a little more awake i appreciate your restraint she said tightly and so you should hungry what is this almost pathological need of yours to feed me youre the analyst he told her with a shrug ive got the wine you got some glasses she might have sighed but it wouldnt have been constructive she did want to talk to him to put their relationship on an even footing again to ask his advice and she hoped to enlist his help in persuading seth to accept her friendship she took the two short thick glasses the hotel provided lifting her eyebrow when phillip sneered at them he had a damn sexy sneer theyre an insult to this very delightful wine he said as he opened the bottle with the stainlesssteel corkscrew hed brought with him but if theyre the best you can offer well just have to make do i forgot to pack my waterford next time he poured the pretty strawcolored wine into the glasses handed her one to beginnings middles and endings we seem to be at all three which means the charades ended the teamwork is established and weve just become lovers im happy with all three aspects of our very interesting relationship teamwork she picked the aspect that didnt shame her or make her nervous seths a quinn with your help well make that legal and permanent and soon she stared down into her wine its important to you that he have your name his grandfathers name phillip corrected and it cant be nearly as important to me as it is to seth yes youre right i saw his face when i told him he looked almost awed professor quinn must have been an extraordinary man my parents were special they had the kind of marriage you rarely see a true partnership based on trust respect love passion it hasnt been easy wondering if my father broke that trust you were afraid that he had cheated on your mother with gloria fathered a child with her sybill sat down it was hideous of her to plant that seed it was also hell living with the seeds in me that i couldnt quite stomp out resentment for seth was he my fathers son his true son while i was just one of the substitutes i knew better he added as he sat beside her in my heart but its one of those mind games that nag at you at three am if nothing else she realized shed eased his mind on that one point but it wasnt enough im going to ask my mother to corroborate my statement in writing i dont know that she will i doubt that she will sybill admitted but ill ask ill try teamwork see he took her hand in his nuzzling it which had her turning her head to study him warily your jaws bruised yeah he grimaced wiggled it cam still has a damn sneaky left he hit you the absolute shock in her voice made him laugh obviously the good doctor didnt come from a world where fists flew i was going to hit him first but he beat me to it which means i owe him one id have paid him back then and there but ethan got me in a choke hold oh god swamped with distress she got to her feet this was about us about what happened today on the boat it should never have happened i knew it would cause trouble between you and your family yes he said evenly it was about us and we worked it out sybill my brothers and i have been pounding on each other as long as weve been brothers its a quinn family tradition like my fathers waffle recipe distress continued to ripple through her but confusion ran with it fists and waffles she wondered pulling a hand through her disordered hair you fight with them physically sure to try to compute it she pressed her fingers to her temples it didnt help a bit why he considered smiled because theyre there he suggested and your parents allowed this type of violent behavior my mother was a pediatrician she always stitched us up he leaned forward to pour himself more wine i think id better explain the whole picture you know that cam ethan and i are adopted yes i did some research before i cameвђ she trailed off glanced back at her laptop well you know that already yeah and you know some of the facts but not the meaning you asked me about my scars it doesnt start there he mused not really cam was the first ray caught him trying to steal my mothers car one morning her car steal her car right out of the driveway he was twelve hed run away from home and was planning on going to mexico at twelve he was stealing cars with plans to go to mexico thats right the first of the quinn bad boys he lifted his glass to toast his absent sibling hed been beaten again by his drunk father and hed figured it was time to run or die oh she braced a hand on the arm of the sofa as she lowered herself again he passed out and my father carried him inside my mother treated him they didnt call the police no cam was terrified and my mother recognized the signs of continual physical abuse they made inquiries arrangements worked with the system and circumvented it and they gave him a home they just made him their son my mother said once that we were all hers already we just hadnt found each other before then there was ethan his mother was a hooker in baltimore a junkie she relieved boredom by knocking him around and then she got the bright idea that she could supplement her income by selling her eightyearold son to perverts sybill clutched her glass in both hands and rocked she said nothing could say nothing he had a few years of that one night one of her customers finished with ethan and with her and got violent since his target was her and not her kid she objected stabbed him she ran and when the cops got there they took ethan to the hospital my mother was doing guest rounds they took him too sybill murmured yeah thats the long and short of it she raised her glass sipped slowly watched him over the rim she didnt know the world he was describing logically she knew it existed but it had never touched hers until now and you my mother worked the block in baltimore strip joints turned tricks on the side a little bait and switch now and then some short cons he shrugged my father was long gone he did some time in jessup for armed robbery and when he got out he didnt look us up did sheвђ did she beat you now and then until i got big enough strong enough that she worried i might hit back his smile was thin and sharp she was right to worry we didnt care for each other much but if i wanted a roof over my head and i did i needed her and i had to pull my weight i picked pockets lifted locks i was pretty good at it hell he said with a faint stir of pride i was damn good at it still i stuck with small shit the kind you turn into easy cash or drugs if things were really tight i sold myself he saw her eyes widen in shock flick away from his survivals not always pretty he said shortly most of the time i had my freedom i was tough and i was mean and i was smart maybe i got picked up once in a while and rattled through the system but i always popped out again another few years of that life and id have been in jessupвђor the morgue another few years of that life he continued watching her face and seth would have gone the same way struggling to absorb it she stared into her wine you see your situations as similar butвђ i recognized gloria yesterday he interrupted a pretty woman gone brittle hard and sharp at the eyes bitter at the mouth she and my mother would have recognized each other too what could she say how could she argue when shed seen the same thing felt the same i didnt recognize her she said quickly for a moment i thought there was a mistake she recognized you and she played the angles pushed the buttons shed know how he paused a moment shed know exactly how so do i she looked at him then noted he was studying her coolly is that what youre doing pushing buttons playing angles maybe it was he thought they would both have to figure that out before much longer right now im answering your question do you want the rest yes she didnt hesitate for shed discovered she very much wanted to hear it all when i was thirteen i thought i had it handled i figured i was just fine until i found myself face down in the gutter bleeding to death driveby shooting wrong place wrong time shot her gaze whipped back to his you were shot in the chest probably should have killed me one of the doctors who made sure i didnt die knew stella quinn she and ray came to see me in the hospital i figured them for weirdos dogooders your basic assholes but i played along with them my mother was done with me and i was going to end up solid in the system i thought id use them until i was steady on my feet again then id take what i needed and cut out who was this boy he described to her and how was she to reconcile him with the man beside her you were going to rob them its what i did what i was but theyвђ how to explain it he wondered the miracle of them they just wore that away until i fell in love with them until id have done anything been anything to make them proud of me it wasnt the paramedics or the surgical team that saved my life it was ray and stella quinn how old were you when they took you in thirteen but i wasnt a kid like seth i wasnt a victim like cam and ethan i made my choices youre wrong for the first time she reached out and taking his face in her hands she kissed him gently he lifted his hands to her wrists had to concentrate on not squeezing her skin the way that soft kiss had squeezed his heart thats not the reaction i expected it wasnt the one shed expected to have but she found herself feeling pity for the boy he described to her and admiration for the man hed made himself into what reaction do you usually get ive never told anyone outside the family he managed a smile bad for the image touched she rested her forehead against his youre right it could have been seth she murmured what happened to you it could have been seth your father saved him from that you and your family saved him while mines done nothing and worse than nothing youre doing something i hope its enough when his mouth came to hers she let herself slide into comfort chapter fourteen contents prev next phillip unlocked the boatyard at seven am the very fact that his brothers hadnt given him grief about not working the day before or about taking a full sunday off the previous week had his guilt quota at peak he expected he had a good hour maybe a little more before cam showed up to continue work on the hull of the sports fisher ethan would put in a morning of crabbing taking advantage of the fall season before heading in to work that afternoon so he would have the place to himself and the quiet and solitude to deal with the paperwork hed neglected the week before quiet didnt mean silence his first act when entering his cramped office was to hit the lights the next was to switch on the radio ten minutes later he was nosedeep in accounts and very much at home well they owed just about everybody he concluded rent utilities insurance premiums the lumberyard and the ever popular mastercard the government had demanded its share in the middle of september and the bite had been just a little nasty the next tax nibble wasnt far enough away to let him relax he juggled figures toyed with them stroked them and decided red wasnt such a bad color theyd made a tidy profit on their first job the bulk of which had been poured back into the business once they turned the hull they would get another draw from their current client that would keep their heads above water but they werent going to see a lot of the color black for a time yet dutifully he cut checks updated the spreadsheet reconciled figures and tried not to mourn the fact that two and two stubbornly insisted on making four he heard the heavy door below open then slam hiding up there again cam called out yeah having a real party some of us have real work to do phillip looked at the figures dancing over his computer screen and laughed shortly it wasnt real work to cam he knew unless you had a tool in your hand best i can do he muttered and shut the computer down he stacked the outgoing bills on the corner of the desk tucked the paychecks in his back pocket then headed down cam was strapping on a tool belt he wore a ball cap backward to keep his hair out of his eyes and it flowed beneath the downsloped bill phillip watched him slide the wedding band off his finger and tuck it carefully into his front pocket just as he would take it out after work phillip mused and slip it back in place rings could catch on tools and cost a man a finger but neither of his brothers left theirs at home he wondered if there was some symbolism or comfort in having that statement of marriage on them one way or the other at all times then he wondered why he was wondering and nudged the question and the idea of it aside since cam had reached the work area first the radio wasnt tuned to the lazy blues phillip would have chosen but to loud kissmyass rock cam eyed him coolly as phillip tugged on a tool belt of his own didnt expect to see you in so bright and early this morning figured you had a late night dont go there again just a comment anna had already chewed him out when he complained to her about phillips involvement with sybill he should be ashamed he shouldnt interfere he should have some compassion for his brothers feelings hed rather take that brothers fist in the face any day than a hot verbal slap from his wife you want to fool around with her its your business shes a pleasure to look at id say shes got a wide cold streak in her though you dont know her and you do cam lifted a hand when phillips eyes flashed just trying to get a handle on it its going to matter to seth i know shes willing to do what she can so hes where he needs to be reading between the lines id say she grew up in a repressive restrictive atmosphere a rich one yeah phillip strode to a pile of planks yeah private schools chauffeurs country clubs servants its a little tough to feel sorry for her i dont think shes looking for sympathy he hefted a plank you said you wanted to get a handle on her im telling you she had advantages i dont know if she had any affection cam shrugged and deciding theyd get more accomplished working together took the other end of the plank to fit it into place on the hull she doesnt strike me as deprived she strikes me as cold restrained cautious he remembered the way she reached out to him the night before still it had been the first time shed done so the only time he clamped down on the frustration of not being sure that cam wasnt right are you and ethan the only ones entitled to a relationship with a woman that satisfies your hormones and your brain no cam lapped the ends deliberately he relaxed his shoulders there was something in phillips voice that gave away that frustration and something else no were not ill talk to seth about her ill talk to him myself all right he matters to me too i know he does he didnt phillip pulled out his hammer to nail the laps not as much as he did to you not enough its different now i know that too for the next few minutes they worked in tandem without words you stood up for him anyway cam added when the plank was in place even when he didnt matter enough i did it for dad we all did it for dad now were doing it for seth by noon the skeleton of the hull had taken on the flesh of wood the smoothlap construction was laborintensive tedious and exacting but it was their trademark a choice that offered extreme structural strength and required great skill by the boatbuilder no one would argue that cam was the most skilled of the three of them in woodworking but phillip thought he was holding his own yeah he thought standing back to scan the exterior planking or skin of the hull he was holding his own you pick up any lunch cam asked before he poured water from a jug into his mouth no shit i bet grace packed ethan one of those monster lunches of hers fried chicken or thick slabs of honeybaked ham you got a wife phillip pointed out cam snorted rolled his eyes oh yeah i can just see me talking anna into packing me a lunch every day shed smack me with her briefcase as she marched out the door to work there are two of us he considered we can take ethan especially if we catch him by surprise when he comes in lets go the easier route phillip dug into his pocket pulled out a quarter heads or tails heads loser gets it and buys it phillip flipped the coin caught it and slapped it onto the back of his hand the eagles beak seemed to sneer at him damn it what do you want meatball sub large chips and six gallons of coffee fine clog your arteries last i checked they dont stock any tofu at crawfords dont know how you eat that crap youre going to die anyway might as well go with a meatball sub you go your way ill go mine he reached in his pocket again for cams paycheck here dont spend it all in one place now i can retire to that little grass shack on maui you got ethans what there is of it yours i dont need it cam narrowed his eyes as phillip pulled on his jacket thats not the way it works im in charge of the books i say how it works you put in your time you take your share i dont need it phillip said with heat this time when i do ill take it he stalked out leaving cam fuming stubborn son of a bitch cam muttered how am i supposed to rag on him when he pulls crap like that he bitched plenty cam mused he nagged his brothers to distraction over the pettiest detail then he handled the details he thought as he capped the water jug hed back you into a corner then hed go to the wall for you it was enough to drive you nuts now he was getting himself twisted up over a woman none of them knew they could trust if things got sticky he for one was going to keep a close eye on sybill griffin and not just for seths sake phillip might have the brains but he was just as stupid as the next guy when it came to a pretty face and young karen lawson whos been working down at the hotel since she hooked up with the mckinney boy last year saw it written down in black and white she called her mama and as bitty lawsons a good friend of mine and my longtime bridge partnerвђthough shell trump your ace if you dont watch herвђshe called me right up and let me know nancy claremont was in her element and that element was gossip as her husband owned a sizable chunk of st chris meaning she did as well and part of that chunk was the old barn those quinn boysвђa wild bunch if you asked herвђrented for their boatyardвђthough god knew what else went on in thereвђshe knew it was not only her right but her duty to pass on the succulent tidbit that had come her way the previous afternoon of course shed used the most convenient method first the telephone but you didnt get the pleasure of facetoface reaction over the phone so shed brought herself out dressed in her brandnew pumpkincolored pantsuit fresh out of the j c penney catalog there was no point in being the most welloff woman in st christophers if you didnt flaunt it a bit and the best place to flaunt and to spread gossip was crawfords secondbest was the stylerite beauty salon over on market and that as shed made an appointment for a cut color and curl was her next stop mother crawford a fixture in st chris for all of her sixtytwo years sat behind the counter in her smeared butcher apron her tongue tucked firmly in her cheek shed already heard the newsвђnot much got by mother and nothing got by her for longвђbut she disposed herself to hear nancy out to think that child is ray quinns grandson and that writer lady with her snooty airs is the sister of that nasty girl who said all those terrible things that boys her nephew her own kin but did she say one word about it no sir she did not just hoitytoitying around going off sailing with phillip quinn and a lot more than sailing if you ask me the way young people carry on today without a snap of their fingers for morals she snapped her own inches from mothers face and her eyes glittered with malicious delight since mother sensed that nancy was about to veer off the subject at hand she shrugged her wide shoulders seems to me she began knowing the scatter of people in the store had their ears bent her way that there are a lot of people around this town who ought to be hanging their heads after what was being passed around about ray whispering about him behind his back when he was living and over his grave when he passed on about him cheating on stella god rest her and having truck with that delauter woman well it wasnt true was it her sharp eyes scanned the store and indeed a few heads did lower satisfied she beamed her gaze hard into nancys glittering eyes seems to me you were willing enough to believe bad about a good man like ray quinn sincerely insulted nancy puffed out her chest why i never believed a word of it mother discussing such matters she thought to herself wasnt the same as believing them truth is a blind man couldnt have missed the way that boys got rays eyes had to be a blood relation why i said to silas just the other day i said silas i wonder if that boy could be a cousin or something to ray shed said no such thing of course but she might have if shed thought of it never thought about him being rays grandson though why to think ray had a daughter all these years which of course proved hed done something wrong in the first place didnt it shed always suspected that ray quinn had been wild in his youth maybe even a hippie and everyone knew what that meant smoking marijuana and having orgies and running around naked but that wasnt something she intended to bring up to mother that little morsel could wait until she was shampooed and tucked into the styling chair at the salon and that she turned out wilder than those boys he and stella brought home she rattled on that girl over to the hotel must be just asвђ she broke off when the door jingled hoping for a fresh ear she was thrilled to see phillip quinn walk in better than an addition to her audience it was one of the actors on the very interesting stage phillip only had to open the door to know what subject was under discussion or had been until he stepped inside silence fell with a clang and eyes darted toward him then guiltily away except for nancy claremonts and mothers why phillip quinn i dont know as ive seen you since your family picnic on the fourth of july nancy fluttered at him wild or not he was a handsome man nancy considered flirting one of the best ways to loosen a mans tongue that was a fine day yes it was he walked up to the counter knowing that stares were being bulleted at his back i need a couple of subs mother crawford a meatball and a turkey well fix you up phil junior she shouted over at her son who jolted at her tone despite being thirtysix and the father of three yes um you going to ring up these people or just scratch your butt the rest of the afternoon he colored muttered under his breath and turned his attention back to the cash register you working down to the boatyard today phillip thats right mrs claremont he busied himself choosing a bag of chips for cam then wandered back to the dairy case to decide on yogurt for himself that young boy usually comes in to pick up lunch doesnt he phillip reached in took out a carton at random hes in school today its friday course it is nancy laughed playfully patting the side of her head dont know where my mind is finelooking young boy ray musta been right proud i dont doubt it weve been hearing that hes got some blood relations close by theres never been anything wrong with your hearing mrs claremont that i recall ill need a couple of large coffees to go mother well fix you up there too nancy you got more than enough news to blow around for the day you keep trying to squeeze more out of this boy youre going to miss your hair appointment i dont know what you could be meaning nancy sniffed shot mother a furious look then fluffed at her hair but i have to be going the husband and i are going to the kiwanis dinnerdance tonight and i need to look my best she flounced out making a beeline for the beauty shop inside mother narrowed her eyes the rest of you got business juniorll ring you up but this aint no lounge you want to stand around and gawk go stand outside phillip disguised a chuckle as a cough when several people decided they had business elsewhere that nancy claremonts got less sense than a peahen mother proclaimed bad enough she dresses herself up like a pumpkin from head to foot but she dont even know how to be subtle mother turned back to phillip and grinned now i wont say i dont have as much gottoknow as the next but by god if you cant try to jiggle a little information out of a body without being so blessed obvious youre not just rude youre stupid with it cant abide bad manners or a soft brain phillip leaned on the counter you know mother ive been thinking maybe id change my name to jeanclaude then move to the wine country of france the loire valley and buy myself a vineyard she tucked her tongue in her cheek again eyes bright shed heard this tale or one of its variations for years do tell id watch my grapes ripen in the sun id eat bread that was hot and fresh and cheese that wasnt it would be a fine satisfying life but ive got just one problem whats that it wont be any good unless you come with me he grabbed her hand kissing it lavishly while she roared with laughter boy you are a caution always were she gasped for breath wiped her eyes then she sighed nancy shes a fool but shes not mean not deep down ray and stella they were just people to her they were a lot more than that to me i know that mother people got something new to talk about theyre going to gum it to death i know that too he nodded so did sybill mothers eyebrows lifted and fell as she realized the implication the girls got guts good for her seth he can be proud hes got blood kin that brave and he can be proud a man like ray was his granddaddy she paused to put the finishing touches on the subs i think ray and stella wouldve liked that girl do you phillip murmured yep i like her mother grinned again as she quickly wrapped the subs in white paper shes not hoitytoity like nancy wants to think girls just shy phillip had reached over for the subs and now his mouth fell open shy sybill sure is tries hard not to be but it costs her some now you get that meatball back to your brother before it gets cold why do i have to care about a bunch of queeros who lived two hundred years ago seth had his history book open his mouth full of grape bubblicious and a stubborn look in his eye after a tenhour day of manual labor phillip wasnt in the mood for one of seths periodic snits the founding fathers of our country were not queeros seth snorted and jabbed a finger at the fullpage drawing of the continental congress theyre wearing dorky wigs and girly clothes that says queero to me it was the fashion he knew the kid was yanking his chain but he couldnt seem to stop his leg from jerking on cue and the use of the word queero to describe anyone because of their fashion sense or their lifestyle demonstrates ignorance and intolerance seth merely smiled sometimes he just liked making phillip grind his teeth the way he was doing now a guy wears a curly wig and high heels he deserves what he gets phillip sighed it was another reaction seth enjoyed he didnt really mind the history crap hed aced the last test hadnt he but it was just plain boring to have to pick out one of the queeros and write some dopey biography you know what these guys were phillip demanded then narrowed his eyes in warning when seth opened his mouth dont say it ill tell you what they were rebels troublemakers and tough guys tough guys get real meeting the way they did drawing up papers making speeches they were giving england and most especially king george the finger he caught a flash of amused interest in seths eyes it wasnt the tea tax not really that was just the platform the excuse they werent going to take any shit from england anymore thats what it came down to making speeches and writing papers isnt like fighting they were making sure there was something to fight for you have to give people an alternative if you want them to toss out brand x you have to give them brand y and make it better stronger tastier what if i told you bubblicious is a ripoff phillip asked inspired as he snatched up the giant pack on seths desk i like it okay to prove it seth blew an enormous purple bubble yeah but im telling you that it sucks and that the people who make it are creeps youre not going to just toss it in the trash because i say so right damn straight but if i gave you a new choice if i told you about this super bubble blowвђ super bubble blow man you slay me shut up sbb its better it lasts longer costs less chewing itll make you and your friends your family your neighbors happier stronger sbb is the gum of the future of your future sbb is right phillip added putting a ring in his voice bubblicious is wrong with sbb youll find personal and religious freedom and no one will ever tell you that you can only have one piece cool phillip was weird all right seth thought with a grin but he was fun where do i sign up with a half laugh phillip tossed the gum back on the desk you get the picture these guys were the brains and the blood and it was their job to get the people excited the brains and the blood seth thought he liked it and figured he could work it into his report okay maybe ill pick patrick henry he doesnt look as dorky as some of the other guys good you can access information on him on the computer when you hit the bibliography of books on him print it out the library in baltimores bound to have more of a selection than the one at school okay and your composition for english is ready to turn in tomorrow man you never let up lets see what youve got jeez grumbling all the way seth dug into his binder and tugged out the single sheet it was titled a dogs life and described a typical day through the eyes of foolish phillip felt his lips twitch as the canine narrator told of his delight in chasing rabbits his irritation with bees the thrill of hanging out with his good and wise friend simon christ the kid was clever he mused as foolish ended his long demanding day curled up on his bed which he generously shared with his boy phillip handed the page back its great i guess we now know how you come by your storytelling talent naturally seths lashes lowered as he carefully slipped the composition back into place ray was pretty smart and all being a college professor he was pretty smart if hed known about you seth hed have done something about it a lot sooner yeah wellвђ seth gave that quinn shoulder jerk im going to talk to the lawyer tomorrow we may be able to speed things up a little with sybills help seth picked up his pencil to doodle on his blotter just shapes circles triangles squares maybe shell change her mind no she wont people do all the time hed waited for weeks ready to run if the quinns had changed theirs when they hadnt hed started to believe but he was always ready to run some people keep their promises no matter what ray did shes not ray she came here to spy on me she came to see if you were all right well i am so she can go its harder to stay phillip said quietly it takes more guts to stay people are already talking about her you know what thats like when people look at you out of the corners of their eyes and whisper yeah theyre just jerks maybe but it still stings he knew it did but he gripped his pencil more tightly added pressure to his doodling youve just got a case on her i might she sure is a looker but if i do have a case on her that doesnt change the basic facts kid you havent had that many people give a good damn about you in your life he waited until seths eyes slid over to his held it took me a while maybe too long to give a good damn myself i did what ray asked me to because i loved him but you didnt want to do it no i didnt want to do it it was a pain in the ass you were a pain in the ass but that started to change little by little i still didnt want to do it it was still a pain in the ass but somewhere along the way i was doing it for you as much as for ray you thought maybe i was his kid and that pissed you off so much phillip thought for adults believing they kept their secrets and sins from children yeah that was one little angle i couldnt get rid of until yesterday i couldnt accept the idea that he might have cheated on my mother or that you might be his son but you put my name on the sign anyway phillip stared a moment then let out a half laugh sometimes he realized you do whats right without really thinking about it and it makes a difference it belonged there just like you belong here and sybill already gave a good damn about you and now we know why when somebody cares its just plain stupid to push them away you think i should see her and talk to her and stuff hed thought about it himself i dont know what to say you saw her and talked to her before you knew you could try it that way maybe you know how grace and anna are all wired up about this birthday dinner of yours next week yeah he lowered his head a little more so the huge grin didnt show he couldnt believe it not really a birthday dinner and he got to pick the food then like a party with pals the next day not that he was going to call it a party because that was really lame when you were turning eleven what do you think of asking her if shed like to come over for that the family dinner deal the grin vanished i dont know i guess she probably wouldnt want to come anyway why dont i ask her you could cop another present out of it yeah a smile came back sly and slow shed have to make it a good one too thats the spirit chapter fifteen contents prev next the ninetyminute appointment with the baltimore lawyer had left sybill jittery and exhausted she thought shed been prepared for it after all shed had two and a half days to get ready since shed called first thing monday morning and had been squeezed into his schedule on wednesday afternoon at least it was over she told herself or this first stage of it was over it had been more difficult than shed imagined to tell a perfect stranger professional or not the secrets and flaws of her family and herself now she had to cope with a cold chilly rain baltimore traffic and her own lessthanstellar driving skills because she wanted to put the traffic and the driving off as long as possible she left her car in the parking garage and faced the rain as a pedestrian fall had already pushed summer back a big step in the city she noted shivering as she scooted across the street at the crosswalk the trees were starting to turn little blushes of red and gold edging the leaves the temperature had plummeted with the wet weather and the wind lashed out tugging at her umbrella as she approached the harbor she might have preferred a dry day so she could have wandered explored appreciated the nicely rehabbed old buildings the tidy waterfront the historic boats moored there but it had its appeal even in a hard frigid rain the water was stonegray and choppy its edges blurring into the sky so that it wasnt possible to tell where either ended most of the visitors and tourists had taken shelter indoors any who went by went by in a hurry she felt alone and insignificant standing in the rain looking at the water wondering what the hell to do next with a sigh she turned and studied the shops she was going to a birthday party on friday she reminded herself it was time she bought her nephew a present it took her more than an hour comparing selecting rejecting art supplies her focus was so narrowed she didnt note the bright glee in the clerks eyes as she began to pile up her choices it had been more than six years since shed bought seth a gift she thought she was going to make up for that it had to be just the right pencils the perfect collection of chalks she examined watercolor brushes as if the wrong choice would mean the end of the world as she knew it she tested the weight and thickness of drawing paper for twenty minutes then agonized over a case for all the supplies in the end she decided simplicity was the answer a young boy would likely feel more comfortable with a plain walnut case it would be durable too if he took care it was something he would have for years and maybe after enough of those years passed he could look at it and think of her kindly your nephews going to be thrilled the clerk informed her giddy as she rang up the purchases these are quality supplies hes very talented distracted sybill began to nibble on her thumbnail a habit shed broken years before youll pack everything carefully and box it of course janice would you come over and give me a hand are you from the area she asked sybill no no im not a friend recommended your store we very much appreciate it janice we need to pack and box these supplies do you giftwrap oh im sorry we dont but theres a stationery store in this center they have a lovely selection of gift wrap and ribbon and cards oh god was all sybill could think what kind of paper did one choose for an elevenyearold boy ribbon did boys want ribbons and bows that comes to five hundred eightythree dollars and sixtynine cents the clerk beamed at her how would you like to pay for that fiveвђ sybill caught herself obviously she decided shed lost her mind nearly six hundred dollars for a childs birthday oh yes shed absolutely gone insane do you take visa she asked weakly absolutely still beaming the clerk held out her hand for the gold card i wonder if you could tell meвђ she blew out a breath as she took out her filofax and flipped to the qs in the address book how to get to this address sure its practically around the corner it would be sybill thought if phillip had lived several blocks away she might have resisted it was a mistake she warned herself as she struggled back into the rain fighting with two enormous shopping bags and an uncooperative umbrella she had no business just dropping in on him he might not even be home it was seven oclock he was probably out to dinner she would be better off going back to her car and driving back to the shore the traffic was lighter now if the rain wasnt at least she should call first but damn it her cell phone was in her purse and she only had two hands it was dark and it was raining and she probably wouldnt find his building anyway if she didnt locate it within five minutes she would turn around and go back to the parking garage she found the tall sleekly elegant building within three and despite a case of nerves stepped gratefully into the warm dry lobby it was quiet and classy with ornamental trees in copper pots polished wood a few deepcushioned chairs in neutral tones the familiar elegance would have relieved her if she hadnt felt like a wet rat invading a luxury liner she had to be crazy coming here like this hadnt she told herself when shed set out for baltimore that day that she wouldnt do this she hadnt told him about the appointment because she hadnt wanted him to know she would be in baltimore hed only try to persuade her to spend time with him for heavens sake shed just seen him on sunday there was no sensible reason for this desperate urge to see him now she would go back to st christophers right now because she had made a terrible mistake she cursed herself as she walked to the elevator stepped inside and pushed the button for the sixteenth floor what was wrong with her why was she doing this oh god what if he was home but he wasnt alone the sheer mortification of that possibility struck her like a blow to the stomach theyd never said anything about exclusivity he had a perfect right to see other women for all she knew he had a platoon of women which only proved shed lost all common sense by becoming involved with him in the first place she couldnt possibly drop in on him like this unannounced uninvited unexpected everything shed been taught about manners protocol acceptable social behavior ordered her to stab the down button and leave every ounce of pride demanded that she turn around before she was humiliated she had no idea what it was that overcame all of that and pushed her out of the elevator and to the door of dont do this dont do this dont do this the order screamed in her head even as she watched her finger depress the buzzer beside his door oh god oh god oh god what have i done what will i say how can i explain please dont be home was her last desperate thought seconds before the door opened sybill his eyes widened in surprise his lips curved lord help her she began to babble im so sorry i should have called i dont mean toвђi shouldnt haveвђ i had to come into the city and i was justвђ here let me have those you buy out the store he was pulling the wet bags out of her icy hands youre freezing come inside i should have called i wasвђ dont be silly he dumped the bags and began to peel her out of her dripping raincoat you should have let me know you were coming into baltimore today when did you get in iвђabout twothirty i had an appointment i was justвђits raining she blurted out hating herself im not used to driving in traffic not really used to driving at all actually and i was a little nervous about it she rambled on while he studied her his brows lifted her cheeks were flushed but he didnt think it was from the cold her voice was skittish and that was new and interesting she couldnt seem to figure out what to do with her hands though the raincoat had protected her neat slategray suit her shoes were soaked and her hair was dewed with rain youre wired up arent you he murmured he put his hands on her arms rubbed up and down to warm them relax i should have called she said for the third time it was rude presumptuousвђ no it wasnt a little risky maybe if youd gotten here twenty minutes earlier i wouldnt have been home yet he drew her a little closer sybill relax okay she closed her eyes amusement flickered into his own as he watched her take slow deep breaths does that breathing stuff really work he asked with a chuckle the irritation in her voice was barely noticeable but it was there studies have proven that the flow of oxygen and mental focus relieves stress i bet ive done studies of my own lets try it my way he brought his mouth to hers rubbed gently persuasively until hers softened yielded warmed his tongue danced lightly over hers teasing out a sigh yeah that works for me he murmured brushing his cheek over her damp hair works just fine for me how about you oral stimulation is also a proven remedy for stress he chuckled im in danger of becoming crazy about you how about some wine she didnt care to analyze his definition of crazy just then i wouldnt mind one glass i shouldnt really im driving not tonight youre not he thought but only smiled sit down ill be right back she went back to the concentrated breathing as he slipped into another room after her nerves settled a bit she studied the apartment a conversation pit in deep forestgreen dominated the living area in its center was a square coffee table riding over it was a large sailboat in what she recognized as murano glass a pair of green iron candlesticks held fat white candles at the far side of the room there was a small bar with a pair of black leather stools behind it was a vintage poster for nuitsstgeorges burgundy depicting an eighteenthcentury french calvary officer sitting on a cask with a glass a pipe and a very satisfied smile the walls were white and splashed here and there with art a framed print of a stylish poster for tattinger champagne with a elegant woman surely that was grace kelly in a sleek black evening gown behind a slim flute of bubbling wine hung over a round glass table with curved steel legs there was a joan miro print an elegant reproduction of alphonse muchas automne lamps were both sparely modern and elegantly deco the carpet was thick and pale gray the uncurtained window wide and wet with rain she thought the room displayed masculine eclectic and witty taste she was admiring a brown leather footstool in the shape of a barnyard pig when he returned with two glasses i like your pig he caught my eye why dont you tell me about what must have been a very interesting day i didnt even ask if you had plans she noted he was dressed in a soft black sweatshirt and jeans and wasnt wearing any shoes but that didnt meanвђ i do now taking her hand he led her across to the deep cushioned ushaped sofa you saw the lawyer this afternoon you knew about that hes a friend he keeps me up to date and phillip admitted to himself hed been acutely disappointed when she hadnt called him to let him know she was coming to the city howd it go well i think he seems confident that the guardianship will go through i couldnt persuade my mother to make a statement though shes angry with you sybill took a quick swallow of wine yes shes angry and no doubt deeply regrets the momentary lapse that allowed her to tell me what happened between her and your father he took her hand its difficult for you im sorry she looked down at their linked fingers how easily he touched she thought absently as if it was the most natural thing in the world im a big girl since its doubtful that this little incident however newsworthy it is in st christophers will ripple across the atlantic to paris shell get over it will you life moves on once the legalities are dealt with there wont be any motive for gloria to make trouble for you and your family for seth she will i imagine continue to make trouble for herself but theres nothing i can do about that nothing i want to do about it a cold streak phillip wondered or a defense even after the legalities are dealt with seth will still be your nephew none of us would stop you from seeing him or being part of his life im not a part of his life she said flatly and as he makes his life it would only be distracting and unconstructive for him to have reminders of his old life its a miracle that what gloria did to him hasnt scarred him more deeply whatever sense of security he has its due to your father to you and your family he doesnt trust me phillip and he has no reason to trust has to be earned you have to want to earn it she rose walked to the dark window and looked out on the city lights that wavered behind the rain when you came to live with ray and stella quinn when they were helping you change your life remake yourself did you maintain contact with your mother with your friends in baltimore my mother was a parttime whore who resented every breath i took and my friends were dealers junkies and thieves i didnt want contact with them any more than they wanted it with me regardless she turned back to face him you understand my point i understand it but i dont agree with it i imagine seth does he set his glass aside as he rose he wants you there on his birthday friday you want me there she corrected and i very much appreciate you for persuading seth to allow it sybillвђ speaking of which she said quickly i found your art store she gestured toward the bags hed set by the door that he stared at the bags all of that immediately she began to nibble on her thumbnail its too much isnt it i knew it i got caught up i can take some of it back or just keep it for myself i dont take enough time to draw anymore hed walked over to examine the bags the boxes inside all of this with a laugh he straightened shook his head hell love it hell go nuts i dont want him to think of it as a bribe like im trying to buy his affection i dont know what got into me once i started i couldnt seem to stop if i were you id stop questioning my motives for doing something nice something impulsive and just a bit over the top gently he tugged at her hand and stop biting your nails im not biting my nails i neverвђ insulted she looked down at her hand saw the ragged thumbnail oh god im biting my nails i havent done that since i was fifteen wheres my nail file phillip edged closer to her as she grabbed her handbag and took out a small manicure set were you a nervous kid hmm a nailbiter it was a bad habit thats all smoothly efficiently she began to repair the damage a nervous habit wouldnt you say dr griffin perhaps but i broke it not entirely nail biting he murmured moving toward her migraines only occasionally skipping meals he continued dont bother to tell me youve eaten tonight i know better it seems to me that your breathing and concentrating isnt quite doing the job on stress lets try my way again i really have to go she was already being drawn into his arms before it gets too late its already too late he brushed his lips over hers once twice you really have to stay its dark its cold its raining he murmured nibbling on toying with her lips and youre a terrible driver im justвђ the nail file slipped out of her fingers out of practice i want to take you to bed i want to take you to my bed the next kiss was deeper longer wetter i want to slip you out of that lovely little suit piece by piece and see whats going on under it i dont know how you do this her breath was already coming too fast her body going too soft i cant keep my thoughts aligned when youre touching me i like them scattered he slid his hands under her trim jacket until his thumbs skimmed the sides of her breasts i like you scattered and trembling it makes me want to do all sorts of things to you when you tremble quick flares of heat sharp stabs of ice were already racing over her what sorts ofвђ things he made a low delighted sound against the side of her throat ill show you he offered and picked her up i dont do this she pushed back her hair staring at him as he carried her into the bedroom do what go to a mans apartment let him carry me to bed i dont do this well just consider it a change in behavioral patterns then he kissed her thoroughly before laying her down on the bed caused byвђ he paused to light a trio of candles on an iron stand in the corner direct stimulation that could work the candlelight did wonders for an already impossibly handsome face its just that youre so attractive he chuckled and slid onto the big bed to nip at her chin and youre so weak not usually actually my sexual appetites are slightly below average ordinarily is that so he lifted her just enough to slip the jacket away yes ive found for myselfвђ ohвђ that while a sexual interlude can be pleasantвђ her breath caught as his fingers slowly released the buttons of her blouse pleasant he prompted it rarely if ever has more than a momentary impact of course thats due to my hormonal makeup of course he lowered his mouth to the soft swell of her breasts that rose temptingly above the cups of her bra and licked butвђbutвђ she clenched her fists at her sides as his tongue swept under the fabric and shot off shock waves youre trying to think im trying to see if i can hows it going not very well you were telling me about your hormonal makeup he reminded her watching her face as he tugged her skirt down over her hips i was oh wellвђ i had a point somewhere she thought vaguely a shiver going through her as he traced a fingertip over her midriff he saw with delight that she wore those sexy thighhugging stockings again this time in sheer smokyblack he imagined shed considered that the black bra and panties were proper coordinates he thanked god for her practical mind sybill i love what goes on under your clothes he moved his mouth to her belly tasted heat and woman felt her muscles quiver she made a helpless little sound in her throat as her body shifted under him he could take her anywhere the power of knowing that flooded him like wine as he took her slowly now wanting them both to linger at each stage he let himself sink he peeled those stockings down those lovely long thighs following the path with his mouth all the way to her toes her skin was creamy smooth fragrant perfect and only more alluring when it quivered lightly under his he slipped fingertips and tongue beneath that silky fantasy snug over her hips in teasing strokes so that she arched shuddered and moaned heat was there centered just there wet arousing heat and when the teasing drove them both mad he stripped that barrier aside and plunged into the hot taste of her she cried out her body rising her hands fisting in his hair as he spun her to peak when she was limp and gasping he took more and showed her more he could have anything everything she was powerless to deny him to stem the tidal wave of sensations that swamped her the world had become him only him the flavor of his skin in her mouth the texture of his hair against her flesh or in her hands the movement of his muscle beneath her fingers murmurs his murmurs echoed in her spinning head the sound of her own name a whisper of pleasure her breath sobbed out as she found his mouth with hers poured everything she was into that hot flood of emotion again again again the urgent demand circled in her head as she clung and gave gave gave now it was his hands that fisted on either side of her head as the shock of feeling slammed into him flashing against desire melting into a need so urgent it was pain she opened for him a breathless invitation and filling her sinking inside her he lifted his head and watched her face in the golden shaft of candlelight her eyes were on his her lips parted as the breath trembled through them something clicked a lock opening a connection made he found his hands groping for hers fingers twining together slow smooth with each movement a fresh shock of pleasure soft silky a promise in the dark he saw her eyes glaze felt the tension the ripple and closed his mouth over hers to capture the gasp as she climaxed stay with me he murmured it as his lips roamed her face as his body moved in hers stay with me what choice did she have she was defenseless against what he brought to her helpless to refuse what he demanded in return the pressure built again an internal demand that refused to be denied when she tumbled free he gathered her close and fell with her i was going to cook he said sometime later when she lay over him limp and speechless but i think well order in and eat in bed all right she kept her eyes closed commanding herself to listen to the beat of his heart and pay no attention to the voice of her own you can sleep in tomorrow idly he toyed with her hair he wanted her there in the morning badly wanted her there in the morning it was something to think about later maybe do some sightseeing or shopping if you hang around for most of the day you can follow me home all right she simply didnt have the strength to assert herself besides she told herself it made sense the baltimore beltway was confusing unfamiliar ground she would enjoy spending a few hours exploring the city it was certainly foolish to drive all the way back tonight in the rain in the dark youre awfully agreeable you caught me in a weak moment im hungry and i dont want to face driving tonight and i miss the city any city ah so its not my irresistible charm and awesome sexual prowess she couldnt stop the smile no but they dont hurt ill make you an eggwhite omelet in the morning and youll be my slave she managed to laugh well see about that she was afraid she was entirely too close to a slavish condition now the heart she was desperately trying to ignore continued to insist that shed fallen in love with him that she warned herself would be a much bigger more permanent mistake than knocking on his door on a rainy evening chapter sixteen contents prev next when a twentynineyearold woman changed her clothes three times before attending an elevenyearold boys birthday party she was in trouble sybill lectured herself on this simple fact even as she stripped off a white silk blouseвђwhite silk for lords sake what had she been thinking ofвђand exchanged it for a teal turtleneck she was going to a simple informal family dinner party she reminded herself not a diplomatic reception which she admitted with a sigh wouldnt have posed nearly as much of a social or fashion dilemma she knew exactly what to wear how to behave and what was expected of her at a formal reception a state dinner a gala a charity ball it was a pathetic statement on her narrow social experience she concluded that she knew neither how to dress nor how to behave at her own nephews birthday dinner she slipped a long chain of silver beads over her head took it off cursed herself and put it on again underdressed overdressed what did it matter she wouldnt fit in anyway she would pretend she did the quinns would pretend she did and everyone would be desperately relieved when she said her goodbyes and went away two hours she told herself she would only stay two hours surely she could survive that everyone would be polite would avoid awkward or nasty scenes for seths sake she picked up her brush to smooth her hair back then secured it with a clip at the nape of her neck before critically studying herself in the mirror she looked confident she decided pleasant nonthreatening exceptвђ maybe the color of the sweater was too vivid too bold gray might be better or brown good god the ringing of the phone was such a welcome diversion she all but leapt on it yes hello dr griffin syb youre still there i was afraid youd taken off gloria her stomach plummeted to her unsteady knees very carefully she lowered herself to the side of the bed where are you oh im around hey im sorry i ditched you the other night i was messed up messed up sybill thought it was a good term for certain conditions from the rapid pace of glorias speech she assumed her sister was messed up even now you stole money out of my wallet i said i was messed up didnt i i panicked you know needed some cash ill pay you back you talk to those quinn bastards i had a meeting with the quinn family as i promised i would sybill uncurled the hand shed bunched into a fist and spoke evenly id given them my word gloria that both of us would meet them to discuss seth well i didnt give mine did i whatd they say whatre they going to do they say you were working as a prostitute that you abused seth physically that you allowed your clients to make sexual advances toward him liars fucking liars they just want to kick me around thats all theyвђ they said sybill went on coolly now that you accused professor quinn of molesting you nearly a dozen years ago intimated that seth was his that you blackmailed him that you sold seth to him that he gave you more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars all bullshit not all but part your part could be accurately described as bullshit professor quinn didnt touch you gloria not twelve years ago not twelve months ago how do you know how the hell do you know whatвђ mother told me that raymond quinn was your father there was silence for a moment then only glorias quick breathing then he owed me didnt he he owed me bigdeal college professor with his boring little life he owed me plenty it was his fault it was all his fault all those years he didnt give me dick he took in scum from the street but he didnt give me dick he didnt know you existed i told him didnt i i told him what hed done and who i was and what he was going to do about it and what does he do he just stares at me he wants to talk to my mother hes not going to give me a fucking dollar until he talks to my mother so you went to the dean and claimed hed molested you put the fear of god into him tightassed son of a bitch shed been right sybill thought her instincts when shed walked into that room at the police station had been right after all it was a mistake this woman was a stranger and when that didnt work you used seth kids got his eyes anybody can see that there was a sucking noise a hiss as gloria dragged on a cigarette changed his tune once he got a look at the kid he gave you money for seth it wasnt enough he owed me listen sybillвђ her voice shifted whined and trembled you dont know what its like ive been raising that kid on my own since he was a baby and that prick jerry delauter took off nobody was going to help me our dear mother wouldnt even accept a phone call from me and that prissy freak she married and tried to pass off as my father wouldnt either i couldve dumped the kid you know i couldve dumped him anytime the money social services doles out for a kid is pitiful sybill stared out through her terrace doors does it always come back to money its easy to look down when youve got plenty of it gloria snapped you never had to hustle you never had to worry perfect daughter always had plenty of everything now its my turn i would have helped you gloria i tried to years ago when you brought seth to new york yeah yeah same old tune get a job straighten up get clean get dry shit i dont want to dance to that get it this is my life im living here baby sister not yours you couldnt pay me to live yours and thats my kid not yours whats today gloria what what the hell are you talking about today is september twentyeighth does that mean anything to you what the hells it supposed to mean its fucking friday and your sons eleventh birthday sybill thought and straightened her shoulders took her stand you wont get seth back gloria though were both aware that thats not your goal you cantвђ shut up lets stop playing games i know you i havent wanted to ive preferred to pretend otherwise but i know you if you want help im still willing to get you into a clinic to pay the bill for rehab i dont need your goddamn help fine thats your choice you wont get another penny out of the quinns you wont come near seth again ive given my deposition to their lawyer and a notarized statement to seths caseworker ive told them everything and if necessary ill testify in court that seths wishes and his best interest are served by his remaining permanently with the quinns ill do everything i can to see that you dont use him anymore you bitch the hiss was filled with anger but under ft was shock you think you can screw me this way you think you can toss me off and side with those bastards against me ill ruin you you can certainly try but you wont succeed you made your deal now its done youre just like her arent you gloria spit the words out like bullets youre just like our ice cunt of a mother perfect society princess and underneath youre nothing but bitch maybe i am sybill thought wearily maybe im going to have to be you blackmailed raymond quinn whod done nothing to harm you it worked at least it worked well enough for you to be paid it wont work with his sons gloria and it wont work with me not anymore wont it well try this i want a hundred thousand a hundred thousand or im going to the press national enquirer hard copy lets see how fast your lousy books sell once i tell my story sales will likely increase twenty percent sybill said mildly i wont be blackmailed gloria you do what you like and think about this youre facing criminal charges in maryland and theres a restraining order against you to keep you away from seth the quinns have evidence ive seen it she continued thinking of the letters gloria had written further criminal charges for extortion and child abuse may be brought id cut my losses if i were you she hung up on the spew of obscenities and closing her eyes lowered her head between her knees the nausea was a greasy sea in her stomach the sneaky edge of a migraine was creeping closer she couldnt stop the trembling shed held it off during the phone call but she couldnt stop it now she stayed just as she was until she could control her breathing again until the worst threat of sickness receded then she rose took one of her pills to ward off the migraine and added blusher to her pale cheeks she gathered her purse seths gifts a jacket against the chill and left the day had been endless how was a guy supposed to sit through hours and hours of school on his birthday i mean he was double ones now and everything he was going to get pizza and french fries and chocolate cake and ice cream and probably even presents hed never actually had a birthday present before seth mused not that he could remember anyway hed probably end up with clothes and shit but it would still be a present if anybody ever showed up whats taking them so long seth demanded again determined to be patient anna continued to slice potatoes for the homemade fries that seth had requested as part of his birthday menu theyll be along its almost six how come i had to come home after school instead of going to the boatyard because anna said and left it at that stop poking into everything will you she added as seth opened the refrigerator again shut it again youre going to be stuffing your face soon enough im starving im making the fries right now arent i i thought grace was going to make them steelyeyed anna stared at him over her shoulder are you suggesting that i cant make french fries he was bored and restless enough to be pleased that hed jabbed her ego well she makes really good ones oh she turned completely around and i dont you do okay anyway well have the pizza he nearly pulled it off but snorted out a chuckle brat anna made a laughing dive at him he danced away howling thats the door thats the door ill get it he raced off leaving anna grinning after him but the wicked laughter faded from his eyes when he yanked open the door and saw sybill on the porch oh hi her heart sank but she fixed on a polite smile happy birthday yeah thanks watching her cautiously he opened the door i appreciate you inviting me at a loss she held out both shopping bags are you allowed to have your gifts sure i guess then his eyes widened all that she nearly sighed he sounded so much like phillip had it all sort of goes together cool hey its grace hampered by the bags which he held now he bumped past her onto the porch the joy in his voice the quick delighted smile on his face was such a marked contrast from the way hed looked at her sybills sinking heart cracked hey grace hey aubrey ill tell anna you guys are here he darted inside again leaving sybill standing by the open door without a clue how to proceed grace got out of the car and smiled sounds like hes excited yes wellвђ she watched grace set a bag on the hood of the car followed by a large clearplastic cake holder then she reached in to unstrap a babbling aubrey from her car seat do you need a hand actually i could use two just a minute baby if you keep wrigglingвђ she tossed another smile over her shoulder as sybill walked over shes been wired all day seth is aubreys favorite person seth hes got a birthday we baked a cake we sure did grace hauled aubrey out then passed her to an astonished sybill would you mind she wanted to wear that dress but the run from here to the house is bound to be a disaster oh wellвђ sybill found herself staring down into a beaming angelic face and holding a bouncing little body dressed in partypink ruffles were having a party aubrey told her and put both her hands on sybills cheeks to ensure her full attention ill have a party next time when im three you can come thank you you smell pretty i do too you certainly do sybills initial stiffness couldnt stand up under that cheerfully charming smile phillips jeep pulled in behind graces and most of the stiffness returned as cam slid out of the passenger seat and shot her a cool unmistakably warning look aubrey let out a shriek of greeting hi hi hi there beautiful cam walked over kissed aubrey lightly on her comically pursed lips then aimed those flinty eyes at sybill hello dr griffin sybill well able to interpret the chilly exchange phillip strode over laid a supporting hand on her shoulder and leaned in for the kiss aubrey was offering hi there sweetie i have a new dress and you look stunning in it in the way of females aubrey deserted sybill without a glance and held out her arms to phillip he managed the transfer easily settling her on his hip been here long he asked sybill no i just got here she watched cam carry three large cardboard boxes of pizza into the house phillip i dont want to cause anyвђ lets go inside he took her hand pulling her along weve got to get this party going dont we aub seth gets presents theyre secrets she whispered it and leaned in close what are they uhuh im not telling he set her down when they stepped into the house gave her frilled bottom a friendly pat and sent her off she shouted for seth and scrambled toward the kitchen shell blab determined to make it work sybill put her smile back in place i wont nope you can just wait for it im going to grab a fast shower before cam beats me to it and uses all the hot water he gave her a quick absent kiss annall get you a drink he added as he headed upstairs great on a huff of breath sybill steeled herself to deal with the quinns alone the kitchen was pandemonium aubrey was squealing seth was talking a mile a minute potatoes were frying with grace manning the stove since cam had anna trapped against the refrigerator with a gleam of pure lust in his eyes you know how i get when i see you in an apron i know how you get when you see me breathe and she hoped it would never change nonetheless she narrowed her eyes at him hands off quinn im busy youve been slaving over a hot stove you really ought to take a shower with me im not going toвђ she spotted the movement out of the corner of her eye there you are sybill in a move that looked very practiced and very effective to sybill anna shifted and jammed her elbow into her husbands stomach what can i get you to drink ahвђ the coffee smells wonderful thank you ill take a beer cam snagged one out of the fridge and go clean up he aimed that look at sybill again then strode out seth stay out of those bags anna ordered as she pulled down a mug no gifts yet shed made the decision to keep him from opening sybills gifts until after dinner she calculated that his aunt would make her excuses and run as quickly as she could manage it after the little ritual was complete man is it my birthday or what yes if you live through it why dont you take aubrey into the other room entertain her for a while well eat as soon as ethan gets here well where is he anyway grumbling seth stalked out with aubrey on his heels and didnt catch the quick grin grace and anna exchanged that goes for you dogs too anna gave foolish a nudge with her foot and pointed her finger with canine sighs both dogs clipped out of the kitchen peace anna closed her eyes to absorb it momentary peace is there anything i can do to help with a shake of her head anna passed over the mug of coffee i think weve got it under control ethan should be here any minute in the big surprise she walked to the window to look out through the gathering dark i hope youve brought an adolescent appetite she added tonights menu consists of pepperoniandsausage pizza peanutoil fries homemade hot fudge sundaes and graces killer chocolate cake well all be in the hospital sybill commented before she thought it through even as she winced anna was laughing we who are about to die salute you uhoh theres ethan shed lowered her voice to a stage whisper at the stove grace dropped her slotted spoon with a clatter did you burn yourself no no chuckling weakly grace stepped back no im ahвђ im just going to run out andвђ help ethan all right butвђhmmm anna finished when grace hurried past her and out the door jumpy she muttered then hit the outside lights its not quite dark yet but it will be by the time we finish this she salvaged the last of the fries and switched off the stove cam and phillip better put a fire under it oh god its cute can you see too curious to resist sybill joined her at the kitchen window she saw grace standing on the dock caught in the last light of the day and ethan just stepping onto it its a boat she murmured a little sailboat a tenfooter they call it a pram annas smile nearly split her face the three of them have been building it over at ethans old houseвђthe one he rents out the tenants let them use the shed over there so seth wouldnt know about it they built it for him whenever they could steal an hour oh hes going to love it well whats this what that anna said and stared hard through the glass she could see grace talking her hands locked together ethan staring at her then he lowered his head to hers i hope theres not anyвђ she trailed off as ethan drew grace close buried his face in her hair and rocked and her arms came up around him oh oh tears flooded annas eyes she must beвђshes pregnant shes just told him i know it oh look she gripped sybills shoulder when ethan scooped a laughing grace up into his arms isnt that beautiful the two of them were wrapped around each other making one silhouette in the last light of day yes yes it is look at me laughing at herself anna yanked off a paper towel and blew her nose im a mess this is going to get to me i know it is im going to want one she blew again sighed i was so sure i could wait a year or two im never going to be able to wait that long now not for that i can just see cam when iвђ she stopped herself sorry she said with a watery laugh its all right its lovely that youre so happy for them that youre so happy for yourself this is really a family occasion especially now anna i really should go dont be a coward anna said pointing her finger youre here and youre going to have to face this nightmare of indigestion and noise just like the rest of us i simply thinkвђ all she could do was close her mouth when the door burst open ethan was still carrying grace and the pair of them wore huge smiles anna were having a baby ethan made the announcement with a catch in his voice what am i blind she brushed ethan aside to kiss grace first ive had my nose to the window oh congratulations then threw her arms around both of them im so happy you have to be godmother ethan turned his face to kiss her we wouldnt have gotten this far without you oh that does it anna burst into tears just as phillip walked in whats going on whys anna crying jesus ethan what happened to grace im fine im wonderful im pregnant no kidding he plucked her out of ethans arms to kiss her lavishly what the hell is going on in here cam demanded still holding grace phillip grinned at him were having a baby oh yeah he arched his eyebrow how does ethan feel about the two of you haha was phillips comment as he set grace carefully on her feet you feel all right cam asked her i feel terrific you look terrific cam drew her into his arms rubbed his chin over her head and the tenderness with which he did both had sybill blinking in surprise nice going bro cam murmured to ethan thanks can i have my wife back now im nearly done cam held grace at arms length if he doesnt take good care of you and the little quinn in there ill beat the hell out of him for you are we ever going to eat seth demanded then stopped at the kitchen doorway and stared whyre anna and grace crying he swept an accusing look around the room including sybill in the heat what happened were happy grace sniffled and accepted the tissue that sybill dug out of her purse im going to have a baby really wow wow thats cool thats way cool does aub know no ethan and i will tell her in a little while but now im going to go get her because theres something you need to see outside outside he started for the door but phillip stepped neatly in his path not yet what is it come on move jeez let me see whats out there we should blindfold him phillip considered we should gag him was cams suggestion ethan took care of matters by hauling seth over his shoulder when grace brought aubrey in ethan winked shifted the wriggling seth and headed out the door youre not throwing me in again seths voice rang with terrified delight and giggles come on guys the waters really cold wimp cam sneered when seth lifted his face from ethans back if you try seth warned eyes dancing with joy and challenge im taking at least one of you with me yeah yeah big talk phillip pushed seths face back down ready he asked when everyone was assembled at the edge of the water good do it ethan man the waters cold seth began ready to scream when ethan dropped him but he was set on his feet and he was turned to face the pretty little wooden boat with skyblue sails that rippled lightly in the evening wind whatвђwhere did that come from the sweat of our brows phillip said dryly while seth gaped at the boat is itвђwhos buying it its not for sale cam said simply itвђ is itвђ it couldnt be he thought while his heart thumped with nerves and hope and shock but hope was paramount in the past year hed learned to hope is it mine youre the only one with a birthday around here cam reminded him dont you want a closer look its mine he whispered it first with such staggered delight and shock that sybill felt her eyes sting mine he exploded with it as he whirled around this time the sheer joy on his face closed her throat to keep youre a good sailor ethan told him quietly shes a tight little boat shes steady but she moves you built her for me his gaze shot from ethans face to phillips to cams for me nah we built her for some other brat cam gave him a light swat on the side of the head what do you think go take a look yeah his voice quavered as he turned yeah can i get in her can i sit in her for christs sake shes yours isnt she his voice rough with emotion cam grabbed seths hand and hauled him onto the dock i think this is a guy thing anna murmured lets give them a few minutes to pull themselves together they love him so much sybill watched another moment as the four males made noises over a little wooden boat i dont think i realized it really until just now he loves them too grace pressed her cheek to aubreys and it was more sybill thought later as she picked at the meal in the noisy kitchen it had been that shock on seths face the utter disbelief that someone loved him could love him enough to understand his hearts desire and understanding make the effort to give it the pattern of his life she thought wearily had been broken shifted then reformed and all before shed really come into it now it was set the way it was meant to be set she didnt belong here she couldnt stay here she couldnt bear it i really should go she said with a wellmannered smile i want to thank you forвђ seth hasnt opened your gift yet anna interrupted why dont we let him rip then well have some cake cake aubrey whacked her palms on her high chair blow the candles out and make a wish soon grace told her seth take sybill into the living room so you can open your gift sure he waited for sybill to stand then with a jerk of his shoulder started out i got it in baltimore she began miserably awkward so if it doesnt suit if you dont like it phillip could exchange things for you okay he pulled a box out of the first bag sat indianstyle on the floor and within seconds was tearing the paper it had taken her untold agonies to choose to shreds you could have used newspaper phillip told her and chuckling nudged her into a chair its a box seth said puzzled and sybills heart sank at his disinterested tone yes wellвђ i kept the receipt so you can take it back and get whatever youd like yeah okay but he caught the hard beam in phillips eye and made an effort its a nice box but he wanted to roll his eyes then he idly flicked the brass hook flipped the top holy shit christ seth cam muttered it glancing over his shoulder as anna walked in from the kitchen man look at all this stuff its got like everything charcoals and pastels and pencils now he looked at sybill with that staggered shock i get to have it all it goes together nervous she twisted her silver beads around her finger you draw so well i thoughtвђ you may want to experiment with other mediums the other box has more supplies more watercolors and brushes some paper ahвђ she eased onto the floor as seth gleefully ripped into the second box you may decide you like acrylics or pen and ink but i lean toward watercolors myself so i thought you might like to try your hand at it i dont know how to do it oh well its a simple process really she leaned over to take one of the brushes and began to explain the basic technique as she spoke she forgot her nerves smiled at him the light from the lamp slanted over her face caught something something in her eyes that jiggled at the corners of his memory did you have a picture on the wall flowers white flowers in a blue vase her fingers tightened on the brush yes in my bedroom in new york one of my watercolors not a very good one and you had colored bottles on a table lots of them different sizes and stuff perfume bottles her throat was closing again so she was forced to clear it i used to collect them you let me sleep in your bed with you his eyes narrowed as he concentrated on the vague blips of memory soft smells soft voice colors and shapes you told me some story about a frog the frog prince into her mind flashed the image of how a little boy had curled against her the bedside lamp holding back the dark for both of them his brightblue eyes intense on her face as shed calmed his fears with a tale of magic and happily ever after you hadвђwhen you came to visit you had bad dreams you were just a little boy i had a puppy you bought me a puppy not a real one just a stuffed toy her vision was blurring her throat closing her heart breaking youвђ you didnt have any toys with you when i brought it home you asked me whose it was and i told you it was yours thats what you called it yours she didnt take it when sheвђi have to go she shot to her feet im sorry i have to go and bolted out the door chapter seventeen contents prev next she got to her car and yanked at the door handle before she realized shed locked it which was she told herself frantically a stupid kneejerk urban habit that had no more place in this pretty rural neighborhood than she did the next thing she realized was that shed run out of the house without her purse her jacket her keys and that she would walk back to the hotel before she would go back inside and face the quinns again after her rude and emotional behavior she whirled when she heard footsteps behind her and wasnt sure if she was relieved or embarrassed to see phillip coming toward her she didnt know what she was what it was that was bubbling up inside her burning and swelling her heart and her throat she only knew she had to escape it im sorry i know that was rude i really have to go in the rush to get out the words bumped and tumbled over each other would you mind getting my purse i need my purse my keys im sorry i hope i didnt spoilвђ whatever was bubbling in her throat was rising higher choking her i have to go youre shaking he said it gently and reached for her but she jerked back its cold i forgot my jacket its not that cold sybill come here no im leaving i have a headache iвђno dont touch me ignoring her words he drew her firmly against him wrapped his arms tight around her and held on its all right baby no its not she wanted to scream it was he blind was he stupid i shouldnt have come your brother hates me seths afraid of me youвђyourвђiвђ oh it hurt the pressure in her chest was agony and it was spreading let me go i dont belong here yes you do hed seen it that connection when she and seth had stared at each other her eyes such a clear blue his so brilliant hed all but heard the click no one hates you no ones afraid of you let go will you he pressed his mouth to her temple would have sworn he felt the pain hissing there why wont you let go im not going to cause a scene if youd just get my purse ill go she was holding herself rigid as marble but the marble was cracking he thought and trembling with the pressure if she didnt let go she would explode so he would have to push he remembered you he remembered that you cared through the hideous pressure there was a stab and the stab pierced her heart i cant stand it i cant bear it her hands gripped his shoulders fingers clenching and unclenching she took him away she took him away it broke my heart she was sobbing now her arms tight around his neck i know i know it did thats the way he murmured and simply picked her up sat on the grass and cradled her against him its about damn time he rocked her while tears that were hot and desperate flooded out of her and soaked his shirt cold he thought as the firestorm of grief whipped through her there was nothing cold in her but the fear of emotional pain he didnt tell her to stop even when the sobs shook her so violently it seemed her bones might snap he didnt offer promises of comfort or solutions he knew the value of purging so he simply stroked and rocked cradling her while she wept out the pain when anna stepped out on the porch phillip shook his head at her stroking still he continued to rock her as the door shut again and left them alone when shed cried herself dry her head felt swollen and hot her throat and stomach raw weak and disoriented she lay exhausted in his arms im sorry dont be you needed that i dont think ive ever known anyone who needed a crying jag more it doesnt solve anything you know better than that he rose and helping her up pulled her toward his jeep get in no i need toвђ get in he repeated with just a hint of impatience ill go get your purse and your jacket he lifted her into the passenger seat but youre not driving his eyes met her tired puffy ones and youre not going to be alone tonight she didnt have the energy to argue she felt hollowed out and insubstantial if he took her back to the hotel she could sleep shed take a pill if she had to and escape she didnt want to think if she started to think she might feel again if she felt again if any part of that flood of feeling came back she would drown in it because his face looked grim and entirely too determined when he strode out of the house with her things sybill accepted her own cowardice and closed her eyes he didnt speak simply climbed in beside her leaned over to secure her seat belt then started the car he let the blessed silence hang throughout the drive she didnt protest when he came into the lobby with her or when he opened her purse for her key card at her door he took her hand again and led her directly to the bedroom get undressed he ordered as she stared at him with those swollen redrimmed eyes he added im not going to jump you for christs sake what do you take me for he didnt know where the flare of temper had come from maybe it was looking at her like this seeing her so utterly wrecked and defenseless turning on his heel he marched into the bathroom seconds later she heard the drum of water in the tub he came out with a glass and aspirin swallow if you dont take care of yourself someone else has to the water felt like glory on her abused throat but before she could thank him hed pulled the glass out of her hand and set it aside she swayed a little and blinked when he tugged her sweater over her head youre going to take a hot bath and relax she was too stupefied to argue as he continued to undress her like a doll when he laid her clothes aside she shivered a little but didnt speak she only stared at him when he picked her up carried her into the bathroom and deposited her in the tub the water was high and a great deal hotter than she considered healthy before she could get her mind around the words to mention it he flicked off the stream sit back shut your eyes do it he said with such unexpected force that she obeyed she kept them closed even when she heard the door click shut behind him she stayed there for twenty minutes nearly nodding off twice only the vague fear of drowning kept her from sinking into sleep and the niggling idea that he would come back in pull her out and dry her off himself was what made her climb shakily out of the tub then again maybe hed gone maybe hed finally gotten disgusted with her outburst and left her alone who could blame him but he was standing by the terrace doors in her bedroom when she stepped out looking out at her view of the bay thank you she knew it was awkward for both of them and struggled to make the effort when he turned and stared at her im sorryвђ you apologize again sybill youre going to piss me off he walked toward her as he spoke laid his hands on her shoulders he cocked his eyebrows when she jumped better he decided running his fingers over her shoulders and neck but not perfect lie down he sighed pulled her toward the bed im not after sex i do have some small level of restraint and i can call on it when im faced with an emotionally and physically exhausted woman on your stomach come on she slid onto the bed and couldnt quite muffle the moan when his fingers began to knead along her shoulder blades youre a psychologist he reminded her what happens to someone who represses their feelings on a regular basis physically or emotionally he laughed a little straddled her then got seriously down to work ill tell you what happens doc they get headaches heartburn stomach pains if and when the dam breaks it all floods out so hard and so fast that they make themselves sick he tugged the robe off her shoulders and used the heels of his hands to press the muscles youre angry with me no im not sybill not with you tell me about when seth stayed with you it was a long time ago he was four phillip prompted and concentrated on the muscles that had just tensed you were in new york same place you have now yes central park west its a quiet neighborhood safe exclusive phillip thought no trendy east village for dr griffin couple of bedrooms yes i use the second as my office he could almost see it tidy organized attractive i guess thats where seth slept no gloria took that room we put seth on the living room sofa he was just a little boy they just showed up on your doorstep one day more or less i hadnt seen her in years i knew about seth shed called me when the man shed married left her i sent her money off and on i didnt want her to come i never said she couldnt but i didnt want her to come shes soвђ disruptive so difficult but she did come yes i came back from a lecture one afternoon and she was waiting outside the building she was furious because the doorman wouldnt let her in wouldnt let her go up to my apartment seth was crying and she was screaming it was justвђ she sighed typical i suppose but you let her in i couldnt just send her away all she had was this little boy and a backpack she begged me to let them stay for a while she said shed been hitchhiking that she was broke she started crying and seth just crawled onto the couch and fell asleep he must have been exhausted how long did they stay a few weeks her mind began to drift between then and now sliding back and forth in time i was going to help her get a job but she said she needed to rest first she said shed been sick then she said a truck driver in oklahoma had raped her i knew she was lying butвђ she was your sister no no she said it wearily if id been honest i would have admitted that that had stopped mattering years before but seth wasвђ he hardly spoke i didnt know anything about children but i got a book and it indicated he should have been much more verbal he nearly smiled it was so easy to picture her selecting the proper book studying it trying to put everything in order he was like this little ghost she murmured this little shadow in the apartment when gloria would go out for any length of time and leave him with me hed creep out a little and the first night she didnt come home until morning he had a nightmare and you let him sleep with you and told him a story the frog prince my nanny told it to me she liked fairy tales he was afraid of the dark i used to be afraid of the dark her voice was thick and slow with fatigue i used to want to sleep in my parents bed when i was afraid but i wasnt allowed to butвђ i didnt think it would hurt him just for a little while no now he could see her a young girl with dark hair and light eyes trembling in the dark it wouldnt have hurt he used to like to look at my perfume bottles he liked the colors and the shapes i bought him crayons he always liked to draw pictures you got him a stuffed dog he liked to watch the dogs being walked in the park he was so sweet when i gave it to him he carried it around everywhere he slept with it you fell in love with him i loved him so much i dont know how it happened it was only a few weeks time doesnt always factor in he skimmed her hair back so he could see her profile the curve of her cheek the angle of her brow it doesnt always play a part its supposed to but it didnt i didnt care that she took my things i didnt care that she stole from me when she left but she took him she didnt even let me say goodbye to him she took him and she left his little dog because she knew it would hurt me she knew i would think about him crying for it at night and worry so i had to stop i had to stop thinking about it i had to stop thinking about him its all right that parts all over now he stroked gently nudging her closer to sleep she wont hurt seth anymore or you i was stupid no you werent he stroked her neck her shoulders felt her body rise and fall on a long long sigh go to sleep dont go no im not he frowned at how fragile the nape of her neck looked under his fingers im not going anywhere and that was a problem he realized as he smoothed his hands down her arms over her back he wanted to stay with her to be with her he wanted to watch her sleep just the way she was sleeping now deep and still he wanted to be the one who held her when she cried for he doubted that she cried often or that she had anyone to hold her when she did he wanted to watch those quiet lake eyes of hers go bright with laughter that lovely soft mouth curve with it he could spend hours listening to the way her voice changed tones from warm amusement to prim formality to earnestness he liked the way she looked in the morning vaguely surprised to see him beside her and at night with pleasure and passion flickering over her face she hadnt a clue how revealing that face was he thought as he tugged down the covers shifting her until he could spread them over her oh it was subtle like her scent a man had to get close very close before he understood but hed gotten close very close without either of them realizing it and hed seen the way shed watched his family with wistfulness with yearning always staying a step back always the observer and hed seen the way shed watched seth with love and with longing and again from a distance so as not to intrude to protect herself he thought it was a combination of both he wasnt quite sure exactly what went on in her heart in her mind but he was determined to find out i think i might be in love with you sybill he said it quietly as he stretched out beside her damn if that doesnt complicate things for both of us she woke in the dark and for a moment just a flash she was a child again and afraid of all those things that lurked in the shadows she had to press her lips together very hard until it hurt because if she cried out one of the servants would hear and might tell her mother her mother would be annoyed her mother wouldnt like it that shed cried about the dark again then she remembered she wasnt a child there was nothing lurking in the shadows but more shadows she was a grown woman who knew it was foolish to be afraid of the dark when there was so much else to fear oh shed made a fool of herself she thought as more memories slipped through a terrible fool of herself letting herself become upset that way worse letting it show until shed had no control none whatsoever instead of maintaining her composure shed rushed out of the house like an idiot inexcusable then shed cried all over phillip wept like a baby right in the front yard as if shedвђ phillip mortification had her moaning aloud covering her face with her hands she sucked in a gasp when an arm came around her ssh she recognized his touch his scent even before he drew her against him before his mouth brushed her temple before his body fit comfortingly to hers its all right he murmured iвђi thought youd gone i said id stay he slitted his eyes open scanned the dull red glow of the bedside alarm three am hotel time should have figured it i didnt mean to wake you as her eyes grew accustomed to the dark she could make out the sweep of his cheekbone the ridge of his nose the shape of his mouth her fingers itched to touch when i wake up in the middle of the night in bed with a beautiful woman its hard to mind she smiled relieved that he wasnt going to press her about her earlier behavior it could just be the two of them now no yesterday to mourn over no tomorrow to worry about i imagine youve had a lot of practice some things you want to get just right his voice was so warm his arm so strong his body so firm when you wake up in the middle of the night in bed with a woman and she wants to seduce you do you mind hardly ever well if you wouldnt mindвђ she shifted slid her body over his found his lips with her lips his tongue with her tongue ill let you know as soon as i start to mind her laugh was low and warm gratitude moved through her for what hed done for her what hed come to be to her she wanted so badly to show him it was dark she could be anything she wanted to be in the dark maybe i wont stop if you do threats he was every bit as surprised and aroused by the teasing purr of her voice as he was by the deliberate circling trail of her fingertips down his body you dont scare me i can she began to follow the trail with her mouth i will give it your best shot jesus his eyes all but crossed bullseye she laughed again and lapped at him like a cat when his body quivered and his breathing grew thick and ragged she scraped her nails slowly up his sides and down again what a wonder the male form was she thought dreamily exploring it hard smooth the planes and angles so perfectly fashioned to mate with woman with her silky here then rough firm then yielding she could make him want and ache just as he made her want and ache she could give she could take just as he did and all the wonderful and wicked things people did in the dark she could do hed go mad if she continued hed die if she stopped her mouth was hot and restless and everywhere those elegant fingers had the blood raging through his veins as their flesh grew damp her body slipped and slid over his a pale silhouette in the dark she was any woman the only woman he craved her like life dreamlike she rose up over him shrugging out of her robe arching her back shaking her hair back what soared through her now was freedom power lust her eyes gleamed catlike against the dark bewitching him she lowered herself taking him inside her slowly dimly aware of what effort it cost him to allow her to set the pace her breath caught released on a moaning sigh of pleasure caught again released again when his hands captured her breasts squeezed possessed she rocked small movements torturously slow arousing herself with the power and kept her eyes on his he shuddered beneath her his muscles bunched his body tight between her thighs strong she thought he was so strong strong enough to let her take him as she chose she skimmed her hands over his chest then lowered her hair curtained their faces as her mouth closed hard over his a tangle of tongues and teeth and breath the orgasm rolled through her like a wave growing building then sweeping her up and over she reared back with it body bowing and rode it out then she rode him he gripped her hips his fingers digging in as she surged over him all reckless speed and clashing light now all heat and greed his mind emptied his lungs screamed and his body climbed desperately toward release when he found it it was brutal and brilliant she seemed to melt over him her body as soft and hot and fluid as a pool of liquid wax her heart thudded hard against the frantic beat of his own he couldnt speak couldnt find the air to push the words free but the ones that shimmered on his tongue were three that hed been careful never to say to a woman triumph still glowed inside her she stretched lazy and satisfied as a cat then curled herself against him that she said sleepily was exactly right what she chuckled softly and ended on a yawn i may not have scared you but i fried your brain no question a sexscrambled brain men who started thinking about love much less bringing the word up when they were hot and naked and wrapped around a woman just got themselves in trouble first time i ever liked waking up at three am already half asleep she pillowed her head on his shoulder she shifted cold she muttered he reached down and tugged up the tangled sheets and blankets she nipped an edge with her fingers pulled them up to her chin for the second time in one night phillip lay awake staring at the ceiling while she slept deep and still beside him chapter eighteen contents prev next it was barely light when phillip crawled out of bed he didnt bother to moan what good would it do just because hed barely slept his mind was fogged with fatigue and worry and he had an entire day of backbreaking manual labor ahead of him was no reason to complain the fact that there was no coffee was a damn good reason to complain sybill stirred as he started to dress you have to go to the boatyard yeah he rolled his tongue over his teeth as he jerked up his slacks christ he didnt even have a toothbrush with him do you want me to order up some breakfast coffee coffee the word alone was like a sirens song in his blood but he grabbed his shirt if she ordered coffee he would have to talk to her he didnt think it was a smart move to have a conversation when he was in such a foul mood and why was he in a foul mood he asked himself because he hadnt slept and shed managed to sneak through his legendary defenses while he wasnt looking and make him fall in love with her ill get some at home his voice was clipped and edgy i have to go back and change anyway which was why he was up so damn early the sheets rustled as she sat up he watched her out of the corner of his eye and reached for his socks she looked tousled and tumbled and temptingly soft yeah she was sneaky all right hitting him over the head like that with her vulnerability sobbing in his arms that way and looking so damned hurt and defenseless then waking up in the middle of the night and turning into some sort of a sexfantasy goddess now she was offering him coffee she had a hell of a nerve i appreciate you staying last night it helped im here to serve he said shortly iвђ she gnawed on her bottom lip alerted and confused by his tone it was a difficult day for both of us i suppose id have been wiser to stay away i was already a little off balance after glorias call and thenвђ his head shot up what gloria called you yes and now sybill thought shed only proven why that was information best kept to herself he was upset everyone was going to be upset she called you yesterday with his temper simmering he picked up his shoe examined it and you didnt think that it was worth mentioning before this i didnt see any point in it because her hands couldnt seem to keep still she pushed at her hair tugged at the sheet i wasnt going to mention it at all actually werent you maybe you forgot momentarily that seth is my familys responsibility that we have a right to know if your sisters going to cause more trouble a need to know he said rising as his anger rapidly approached flash point so that we can protect him she wont do anything toвђ how the hell do you know he exploded with it rounding on her so that she clutched the sheets in whiteknuckled fingers how can you know by observing from ten paces back goddamn it sybill this isnt a fucking exercise this is life what the hell did she want she wanted to shrink as she always did from anger she coated her heart and her voice with ice as she always did to face it she wanted money of course she wanted me to demand it from you to give her more myself she shouted at me too and swore at me just as you are it appears that staying ten paces back has put me directly in the middle i want to know if and when she contacts you again what did you tell her sybill reached for her robe and her hand was steady i told her that your family would not give her anything and neither would i that i had spoken with your lawyer that i had added and would continue to add my weight and influence to see that seth remains a permanent part of your family thats something then he muttered frowning at her as she pulled on her robe its the least i can do isnt it her tone was frigid distant and final excuse me she strode into the bathroom shut the door from where he stood phillip heard the deliberate click of the lock well fine thats just fine he snarled at the door grabbed his jacket then got the hell out before he made matters any worse than they already were they didnt get any better when he arrived home to find less than half a cup of coffee left in the pot when he discovered midway through his shower that cam had obviously used most of the hot water he decided that just made it all perfect then he stepped into his room a towel slung around his hips and found seth sitting on the side of his bed definitely perfect hey seth eyed him steadily youre up early i thought id maybe go in with you for a couple of hours phillip turned to pull underwear and jeans out of his dresser you arent working today youve got your friends coming over later for the party thats not till this afternoon seth lifted a shoulder theres time suit yourself hed expected phillip to be steamed he had a thing for sybill didnt he seth reminded himself it had been tough to come in here to wait to know hed have to say something so he said the single thing that was most on his mind i didnt mean to make her cry shit was all phillip could think he yanked on his jockeys he wasnt going to get out of this you didnt she was just due for a cry thats all i guess shes pretty pissed off no shes not resigned to it now phillip pulled on his jeans look women are hard to understand under the best of circumstances these circumstances pretty much suck i guess maybe he wasnt so steamed after all i just sort of remembered some stuff seth stared at the scars on phillips chest because it was easier than looking into his eyes and because well the scars were so cool then she got so whacked out about it and everything some people dont know what to do with feelings he sighed sat on the bed beside seth and was bitterly ashamed of himself hed blasted sybill right between the eyes because he hadnt known what to do with his feelings so they cry or they yell or they go off and sulk in a corner she cares about you but she doesnt know exactly what to do about it or what you want her to do about it i dont know shesвђ shes not like gloria his voice rose a pitch shes decent ray was decent too and ive gotвђtheyre like relatives right so ive gotвђ understanding came quickly and squeezed his heart youve got rays eyes phillip kept his voice matteroffact knowing seth would believe him if he said it right the color and the shape but that something that was behind them too the something that was decent youve got a sharp brain just like sybill it thinks it analyzes it wonders and under all that it tries to do whats right whats decent youve got both of them in you he nudged seths shoulder with his own pretty cool huh yeah the smile bloomed its cool okay scram or were never going to get out of here he arrived at the boatyard nearly fortyfive minutes behind cam and expected to get grief for it cam was already at the shaper rabbeting the next run of planks bruce springsteen shouted from the radio about his glory days in defense phillip turned the volume down instantly cams head came up i cant hear it over the tool unless its loud none of us will be able to hear if you keep blasting our ears for hours every day what did you say something haha well were cheerful arent we cam reached over and switched off the power so hows sybill dont start on me cam angled his head while seth shifted his gaze from man to man and anticipated the entertainment value of a quinn battle i asked a simple question shell survive phillip snatched up a tool belt i realize youd prefer to see her run out of town on a rail but youll have to make do with the fact that i gave her a verbal bashing this morning rather than a physical one why the hell did you do that because she pissed me off phillip shouted because it all pisses me off especially you fine you want to try for a physical bashing im available but i asked a goddamn simple question cam pulled the board off the shaper and heaved it toward the stack where it landed with a clatter she already took a punch in the gut yesterday why the hell would you add to it this morning youre defending her phillip stepped forward until they were nose to nose youre defending her after all the shit youve handed me over her ive got eyes dont i i saw her face last night what the hell do you take me for he jabbed a finger into phillips chest anybody whod kick a woman when shes that torn up ought to have his neck snapped you son of aвђ phillips fist was clenched and halfway through the swing before he stopped himself he would have enjoyed a few bloody rounds especially since ethan wasnt there to break it up but not when he was the one who deserved to be bloodied he unclenched his fist spreading his fingers as he turned away to try to find some control he saw seth watching him with dark interested eyes and snarled dont you start i didnt say a word look i took care of her okay he dragged a hand through his hair and aimed his rationalization at both of them i let her cry it out patted her hand i dumped her into a hot tub tucked her into bed i stayed with her maybe i got an hours sleep out of the deal so im feeling just a little testy right now whyd you yell at her seth wanted to know okay he took a steadying breath pressed his fingers to his tired eyes this morning she told me that gloria had called her yesterday maybe i overreacted but damn it she should have told us what did she want seths lips had gone white instinctively cam stepped over and laid a hand on his shoulder dont let her spook you kid youre beyond that now whats the deal he demanded of phillip i didnt get details i was too busy blasting sybill for not telling me sooner the gist of it was money phillip shifted his gaze to seth spoke directly to him she told gloria to kiss ass no money no nothing no how she told her shed been to the lawyer and was making sure you stayed just where you are your aunts no pushover cam said easily giving seths shoulder a quick squeeze shes got spine yeah seth straightened his own shes okay your brother over there cam continued nodding toward phillip hes an asshole but the rest of us have sense enough to know that sybill didnt bring up the phone call yesterday because it was a party she didnt want anybody to get upset a guy doesnt turn eleven every day so i screwed up muttering to himself phillip grabbed a plank and prepared to beat out his frustrations with nail and wood ill fix it sybill needed to do some fixing of her own it had taken her most of the day to work up both the courage and the plan she pulled into the quinn driveway just after four and was relieved not to see phillips jeep hed be at the boatyard for another hour at least she calculated seth would be with him as it was saturday night they would most likely stop on the way home pick up some takeout it was their pattern and she knew her behavioral patterns even if she didnt seem to be able to fully connect with the people who were doing the behaving ten paces back she thought and was hurt all over again annoyed she ordered herself out of the car she would do what she had come to do it should take no more than fifteen minutes to apologize to anna for the apology to be accepted at least outwardly she would explain about the call from gloria in detail so that it could be documented then she would leave she would be back at her hotel buried in her work long before phillip arrived on the scene she knocked briskly on the door its open came the response id rather kill myself than get up warily sybill reached for the knob hesitated then opened the door all she could do was stare the quinn living room was usually cluttered always appeared livedin but just now it appeared to have been lived in by a rampaging platoon of insane elves paper plates plastic cups several of them dumped or spilled littered the floor and the tables small plastic men were strewn everywhere as if a war had been waged and the casualties were horrendous obviously fatal accidents had taken place with model cars and trucks shreds of wrapping paper were sprinkled over all like confetti on a particularly wild new years eve sprawled in a chair surveying the damage was anna her hair was in her face and her face was pale oh great she muttered turning narrowed eyes to sybill now she shows up iвђim sorry easy for you to say ive just spent two and a half hours battling ten elevenyearold boys noвђnot boys she corrected between her teeth animals beasts spawns of satan i just sent grace home with orders to lie down im afraid this experience might affect the baby he could be born a mutant the childrens party sybill remembered her dazzled eyes scanning the room shed forgotten its over it will never be over i will wake up at night for the rest of my life screaming until they cart me off to a padded room i have ice cream in my hair theres some sort ofвђ mass on the kitchen table im afraid to go in there i think it moved three boys managed to fall in the water and had to be dragged out and dried off theyll probably catch pneumonia and well be sued one of those creatures who disguised himself as a young boy ate approximately sixtyfive pieces of cake then got into my carвђi dont know how he got by me theyre like lightningвђand proceeded to throw up oh dear sybill knew it wasnt a laughing matter it shocked her to realize that her stomach muscles were quivering im so sorry can i help you ah clean up im not touching any of it those menвђthe one who claims to be my husband and his idiot brothersвђtheyre going to do it theyre going to scrub and clean and wipe and shovel theyre going to do it all they knew she said in a vicious whisper they knew what a boys birthday party would mean how was i to know but they did and they hid themselves away down at that boatyard using that lame excuse about contract deadlines they left me and grace alone with this this unspeakable duty she shut her eyes oh the horror anna was silent for a moment her eyes still closed go ahead you can laugh im too weak to get up and belt you you worked so hard to do this for seth he had the time of his life annas lips curved as she opened her eyes and since im going to make cam and his brothers clean it up im feeling pretty good about it all in all how are you im fine i came to apologize for last night apologize for what the question threw her off rhythm she was already running behind schedule she thought distracted by the chaos and annas rambling monologue sybill cleared her throat and began again for last night it was rude of me to leave without thanking you forвђ sybill im too tired to listen to nonsense you werent rude you have nothing to apologize for and youll annoy me if you keep this up you were upset and you had a perfect right to be and that blew sybills carefully prepared speech all to hell i honestly dont understand why people in this family wont listen to much less accept a sincere apology for regrettable behavior boy if thats the tone you use when you lecture anna observed with admiration your audience must sit at attention but to answer your question i suppose we dont because we so often indulge in what could be termed regrettable behavior ourselves id ask you to sit down but those are really lovely slacks and i have no idea what nasty surprises there are on any of the cushions i dont intend to stay you couldnt see your face anna said more gently when he looked up at you when he told you what he remembered but i could see it sybill i could see it was a great deal more than duty or responsibility or a valiant attempt to do what was right that brought you here it must have crushed you when she took him away all those years ago i cant do this again the burn of tears scalded the back of her eyes i just cant do this again you dont have to anna murmured i just want you to know i understand in my work i see so many damaged people battered women abused children men who are at the end of their ropes the elderly we so blithely displace i care sybill i care about every one of them who come to me for help she sighed a little and spread her fingers but in order to help them i have to hold part of myself back be objective realistic practical if i threw all my emotions into every one of my cases i couldnt do my job id burn out burn up i understand the need for a little distance yes the painful tension drained out of sybills shoulders of course you do it was different with seth anna went on right from the first minute everything about him pulled at me i couldnt stop it i tried but i couldnt ive thought about that and i believe sincerely that my feelings for him were there just there even before i met him we were meant to be a part of each others lives he was meant to be part of this family and this family was meant to be mine risking the consequences sybill eased down on the arm of the sofa i wanted to tell youвђ youre so good with him you and grace youre so good for him the relationship he has with his brothers is wonderful and its vital that strong male influence is important for a boy but the female what you and grace give him is just as vital you have something to give him too hes outside anna told her drooling over his boat i dont want to upset him i really have to go running away last night was understandable and acceptable annas gaze was direct level and challenging running now isnt you must be very good at your job sybill said after a moment im damn good at it go talk to him if i manage to get out of this chair in this lifetime ill put some fresh coffee on it wasnt easy but then sybill supposed it wasnt meant to be crossing that lawn toward the boy who sat in the pretty little boat so obviously dreaming of fast sails foolish saw her first and alerted raced toward her barking she braced herself and put a hand out hoping to ward him off foolish skimmed his head under it turning the defensive gesture into a stroke his fur was so soft and warm his eyes so adoring his face so fittingly silly that she relaxed into a smile you really are foolish arent you he sat batting at her with his paw until she took it and shook satisfied he raced back toward the boat where seth watched and waited hi he stayed where he was pulling on the line and making the small triangle of sail sway hello have you taken it out yet nah anna wouldnt let me and any of the guys go out in her today he jerked a shoulder like wed drown or something but you had a good time at your party it was cool annas a little pissedвђ he stopped and looked toward the house she really hated it when he swore shes pretty steamed about jake barfing in her car so i figured id hang out here until she levels thats probably very sensible then silence fell heavy as they both looked out over the water and wondered what to say sybill braced herself seth i didnt say goodbye to you last night i shouldnt have left the way i did its okay he shrugged again i didnt think you remembered me or any of the time you stayed with me in new york i thought id made it up it was too hard to sit in the boat and look so far up he climbed out then sat on the dock to dangle his legs sometimes id dream about some of it like the stuffed dog and stuff yours she murmured yeah thats pretty lame she didnt talk about you or anything so i thought id just made it up sometimesвђ she took the risk and sat beside him sometimes it was almost like that for me too i still have the dog you kept it it was all i had left of you you mattered to me i know it may not seem like that now but you did i didnt want you to because i was hers partly she had to be honest had to give him that at least she was never kind seth something was twisted in her it seemed that she could never be happy unless the people closest to her werent i didnt want her back in my life id planned to give her a day or two then arrange to have the two of you moved to a shelter that way i would fulfill my family obligation and protect my own lifestyle but you didnt i made excuses at first just one more night then i admitted that i was letting her stay because i wanted to keep you there if i found her a job helped her get an apartment worked with her to put her life back together i could keep you close id never hadвђyou were theвђ she ordered herself to take one cleansing breath and just say it you loved me you were the first person who ever did i didnt want to lose that and when i did i pulled myself back right back to where id been before you came i was thinking much more of myself than of you id like to make up for that a little by thinking of you now he looked away from her down at the feet he was kicking back and forth over the water phil said how she called and you told her to kiss ass not precisely in those words but thats what you meant right i guess it was she nearly smiled yes you guys got the same mother right but like different fathers yes thats right do you know who my father was i never met him no no i mean do you know who he was she was always making up different guys and names and shit and stuff he corrected i just wondered thats all i only know his name was jeremy delauter they werent married long andвђ married his gaze flew back to hers she never got married she was just bsing you no i saw the marriage license she had it with her when she came to new york she thought i could help her track him down and sue him for child support he considered a moment absorbing the possibility maybe it doesnt matter i figured she just took the name from some guy she lived with sometime if he got hooked up with her he mustve been a loser i could arrange for a search im sure we could locate him it would take some time i dont want that there wasnt any panic in his voice just disinterest i was just wondering if you knew him thats all i got a family now he lifted his arm as foolish nosed into his armpit and wrapped it around the dogs neck yes you do aching a little she started to rise she hesitated her eye drawn toward a flash of white she saw the heron soar gliding over the water just at the edge of the trees then it was gone around the bend leaving barely a ripple on the air a lovely thing she thought a lovely spot a harbor for troubled souls for young boys who only needed a chance to become men perhaps she couldnt thank ray and stella quinn for what theyd done here but she could show her gratitude by stepping aside now and letting their sons finish the job with seth well i should go the art stuff you gave me its really great im glad you like it you have talent i fooled around some with the charcoal last night she hesitated again oh im not getting it right he twisted his head to look up at her its a lot different than a pencil maybe you could show me how to do it she stared hard over the water because she knew he wasnt asking he was offering now it seemed she was being given a chance and a choice yes i could show you now yes she concentrated on keeping her voice even i could show you now cool chapter nineteen contents prev next so hed been a little hard on her phillip told himself maybe he felt that she should have told him immediately that gloria had contacted her party or no party she could have taken him aside and filled him in but he shouldnt have jumped all over her and then walked out still in his own defense hed felt raw and annoyed and unsettled hed spent the first part of the night worried about her and the second part worried about himself was he supposed to be happy that shed wormed her way through his defenses was he supposed to jump for joy that in a matter of weeks shed managed to drill a hole in the highly polished shield hed maintained so expertly for over thirty years he didnt think so but he was willing to admit that he hadnt behaved well he was even willing to offer a peace token in the form of vintage champagne and longstemmed roses hed packed the basket himself two bottles of dom well chilled two crystal flutesвђhe wasnt about to insult that brilliant french monk with hotel glassesвђthe beluga hed craftily hidden for just such an occasion inside an empty carton of plain lowfat yogurt knowing that no one in his family would touch it hed made the toast points himself and had selected both the blushpink roses and the vase with care he thought she might be a tad resistant to the visit it never hurt to pave the way with champagne and flowers and since he intended to do a little worming himself they couldnt hurt he was going to loosen her up he decided talk to her and more get her talking he wasnt leaving until he had a much clearer view on just who sybill griffin was he rapped cheerfully on her door that was going to be his approachвђcasual cheer he shot a quick charming smile at the peephole when he heard footsteps saw the vague telltale shadow and he stood as those footsteps receded okay maybe more than a tad resistant he concluded and knocked again come on sybill i know youre there i want to talk to you silence he discovered didnt have to be empty it could be crowded with ice okay fine he thought scowling at the door she wanted to do it the hard way he set the basket beside the door then marched back down the hall to the fire stairs and started down for what he had in mind it was wiser not to be seen leaving the lobby ticked her off good didnt you ray commented as he jogged down the steps beside his son christ almighty phillip glared into his fathers face next time why dont you just shoot me in the head itd be less embarrassing than to die of a heart attack at my age your hearts strong enough so shes not speaking to you shell talk to me phillip said grimly bribing with bubbly ray jerked a thumb behind him it works the flowers are a good touch i could usually get around your mother with flowers quicker if i groveled im not groveling on that he was firm it was just as much her fault its never just as much their fault ray said with a wink the sooner you accept that the sooner youll get makeup sex jesus dad he could only rub a hand over his face im not going to talk to you about sex why not wouldnt be the first time he sighed as they came to the ground level seems to me your mother and i talked to you plenty and talked to you straight about sex gave you your first condoms too that was then phillip muttered ive got the hang of it now ray let out a rippling delighted laugh i bet you do but then again sex isnt the prime motive here its always a motive he added were men we cant help it lady up there shes got you worried though because its not just about sex its about love im not in love with her exactly im justвђ involved love always was a tough one for you ray stepped out into the windy night zipped up the frayed sideline jacket he wore over his jeans when it came to females that is anytime things started to head toward serious youd start moving fast and loose in the opposite direction he grinned at phillip looks to me like youre moving straight ahead this time shes seths aunt annoyance pricked at the back of his neck as he walked around the building if shes going to be part of his life our lives i need to understand her seths part of it but you slapped her back this morning because you were scared phillip planted his feet legs spread rolled his shoulders as he studied rays face number one i cant believe im standing here arguing with you number two it occurs to me that you were a hell of a lot better at letting me run my own life when you were alive than you are as a dead man ray only smiled well ive got what you might call a broader point of view now i want you happy phil im not going to move on until im sure the people who matter to me are happy im ready to move on he said quietly to be with your mother have youвђdid youвђ how is she shes waiting for me the glow slipped over rays face and into his eyes and shes never been what you could call the waiting type i miss her so much i know so do i shed be flattered and annoyed too that under it all youve never been willing to settle for less than the kind of woman she was staggered because it was true and a secret that hed kept carefully locked up phillip stared its not that not altogether that part of that then ray nodded you have to find your own phil and make your own youre getting there you did a fine job with seth today so did she he said glancing up at the light shining through sybills bedroom window you make a fine team even when youre pulling in different directions thats because you both care more than you might understand did you know he was your grandson no not at first he sighed now when gloria found me she hit me with all of it at once i never knew about her and there she was shouting swearing accusing demanding couldnt calm her down or make sense of it next thing i knew shed gone to the dean with that story about how id molested her shes a troubled young woman shes a bitch ray only moved his shoulders if id known about her soonerвђ well thats done i couldnt save gloria but i could save seth one look at him and i knew so i paid her maybe that was wrong but the boy needed me it took me weeks to track down barbara all i wanted from her was confirmation i wrote to her three times even called paris but she wouldnt speak to me i was still working on that when i had the accident stupid he admitted i let gloria upset me i was angry with her myself everything worried about seth about how the three of you would take it when i explained it all driving too fast not paying attention well we would have stood with you i know that i let myself forget it and that was stupid too stella was gone the three of you had your own lives and i let myself brood and forget youre standing with seth now and thats more important were nearly there with sybill adding her voice the permanent guardianships a given shes adding more than her voice and shell add more yet shes stronger than she gives herself credit for than anyone gives her credit for in a swift change of mood ray clucked his tongue shook his head i guess youre going up there thats the plan never quite lost that unfortunate skill maybe this time thats a good thing that girl could use some surprises in her life ray winked again watch your step youre not going to come up are you no ray slapped phillips shoulder and let out a hearty laugh some things a father just doesnt need to see good but since youre here make it easier for me give me a boost up to that first balcony sure they cant arrest me can they ray cupped his hands giving phillips foot a helpful push then stood back to watch him make the climb he watched and he smiled im going to miss you he said quietly and faded into shadows in the parlor sybill concentrated fiercely on her work she didnt give a damn if it had been petty unreasonable behavior to ignore phillips knock shed had enough emotional upheaval for one weekend and besides hed given up quickly enough hadnt he she listened to the wind rattle against her windows set her teeth and pounded the keyboard the import of internal news appears to outweigh that of the external while television newspapers and other information sources are as readily available in the small community as they are in large urban areas the actions and involvements of ones neighbors take precedent when the population is limited information is passed on with varying degrees of accuracy through word of mouth gossip is an accepted form of communication the network is admirably quick and efficient disattendingвђthe pretense of not hearing a private conversation in a public placeвђis not as prevalent in the small community as in the large city however in transient areas such as hotels disattending is still a consistent and acceptable behavioral pattern i would conclude that the reason for this is the regular comings and goings of outsiders in this type of area overt attention is paid however in other areas such as her fingers froze her mouth dropped open as she watched phillip slide her terrace door open and step inside whatвђ the locks on these things are pathetic he said he walked to the front door opened it and picked up the basket and vase of flowers hed left there i figured i could risk these we dont get a lot of thievery around here you might want to add that to your notes he set the vase of roses on her desk you climbed up the building she could only stare at him amazed the winds a bitch too he opened the basket took out the first bottle i could use a drink how about you you climbed up the building weve already established that he opened the wine with an expert and muffled pop you cantвђ she gestured wildly just break in here open champagne i just did he poured two glasses and discovered it didnt do his ego any harm to have her gaping at him im sorry about this morning sybill smiling he offered her a glass of champagne i was feeling pretty rough and i took it out on you so you apologize by breaking into my room i didnt break anything besides you werent going to open the door and the flowers wanted to be in here so did i truce he said and waited hed climbed up the building she still couldnt get over it no one had ever committed such a bold and foolish act for her she stared at him into those golden angel eyes and felt herself softening i have work he grinned because he saw the yielding i have beluga she tapped her fingers on the wrist rest of her keyboard flowers champagne caviar do you usually come so well equipped when you break and enter only when i want to apologize and throw myself on the mercy of a beautiful woman got any mercy to spare sybill i suppose i might i wasnt keeping glorias phone call from you phillip i know you werent believe me if i hadnt figured that out myself cam would have beaten it into my head this morning cam she blinked in shock he doesnt like me youre wrong he was worried about you can i persuade you to take a break from work all right she saved her file shut down the machine im glad were not angry with each other it only complicates things i saw seth this afternoon so i hear she accepted the wine sipped did you and your brothers clean up the house he gave her a pained and pitiful look i dont want to talk about it im going to have nightmares as it is he took her hand drew her over to the sofa lets talk about something less frightening seth showed me the charcoal sketch of his boat that you helped him with hes really good he catches on so quickly really listens pays attention hes got a fine eye for detail and perspective i saw the one you did of the house too casually phillip leaned forward for the bottle and topped off her wine youre really good too im surprised you didnt pursue art as a profession i had lessons as a girl art music dance i took a few courses in college desperately relieved that they were no longer at odds she settled back and enjoyed her wine it wasnt anything serious id always known id go into psychology always more or less the arts arent for people like me why the question confused her put her on guard it wasnt practical did you say you had beluga in there there he thought the first step back hed simply have to go around her mmmhmm he took out the container and the toast points refilled her glass what instrument do you play piano yeah me too he shot her an easy smile well have to work up a duet my parents loved music all of us play something its important that a child learn to appreciate music sure its fun he spread a toast point offered it sometimes the five of us would kill a saturday night playing together you all played together that was nice i always hated playing in front of anyone its so easy to make a mistake so what if you did nobodys going to cut off your fingers for hitting a sour note my mother would be mortified and that would be worse thanвђ she caught herself frowned into her wine started to set it aside he moved smoothly adding more to her glass my mother really loved to play the piano thats why i picked it up at first i wanted to share something with her specifically i was so in love with her we all were but for me she was everything strong and right and kind about women i wanted her to be proud of me whenever i saw that she was whenever she told me she was it was the most amazing feeling some people strive all their lives for their parents approval and never come close to gaining their pride there was something bitter and cold in her voice she caught it herself and managed a weak laugh im drinking too much its going to my head deliberately he filled her glass again youre among friends overindulging in alcoholвђeven lovely alcoholвђis an abuse overindulging on a regular basis is an abuse he corrected ever been drunk sybill of course not youre due he tapped his glass to hers tell me about the first time you tasted champagne i dont remember we were often served watered wine at dinner when we were children it was important that we learn to appreciate the proper wines how they were served what to serve them with the correct glass for red the correct glass for white i could easily have coordinated a formal dinner party for twenty when i was twelve really she laughed a little let the wine froth in her head its an important skill can you imagine the horror if one bungles the seating or serves an inferior wine with the main course an evening in ruins reputations in tatters people expect a certain level of tedium at such affairs but not a substandard merlot you attended a lot of formal dinner parties yes indeed first several smaller what you might term practice ones with intimates of my parents so that i could be judged ready when i was sixteen my mother gave a large important dinner for the french ambassador and his wife that was my first official appearance i was terrified not enough practice oh i had plenty of practice hours of instruction on protocol i was just so painfully shy were you he murmured tucking her hair behind her ear score one for mother crawford he thought so silly but any time i had to face people that way my stomach would seize up and my heart would pound so hard i lived in terror that i would spill something say something i shouldnt or have nothing to say at all did you tell your parents tell them what that you were afraid oh she waved her hand at that as if it were the most absurd of questions then picked up the bottle to pour more champagne what would be the point i had to do what was expected of me why what would happen if you didnt would they beat you lock you in a closet of course not they werent monsters theyd be disappointed theyd disapprove it was horrible when they looked at you that wayвђtightlipped coldeyedвђas if you were defective it was easier just to get through it and after a while you learned how to deal with it observe rather than participate he said quietly ive made a good career out of it maybe i didnt fulfill my obligations by making an important marriage and giving a lifetime of those beastly dinner parties and raising a pair of wellbehaved properly bred children she said with rising heat but i made good use of my education and a good career which im certainly more suited for than the other im out of wine lets slow down a littleвђ why she laughed and plucked out the second bottle herself were among friends im getting drunk and i think i like it what the hell phillip thought and took the bottle from her to open it hed wanted to dig under that proper and polished surface of hers now that he was there there was no point in backing off but you were married once he reminded her i told you it didnt count it was not an important marriage it was an impulse a small and failed attempt at rebellion i make a poor rebel mmm she swallowed champagne gestured with her glass i was supposed to marry one of the sons of my fathers associate from britain which one oh either they were both quite acceptable distant relations of the queen my mother was quite determined to have her daughter associated by marriage with royalty it would have been a triumph of course i was only fourteen so she had plenty of time to work out the plan the timing i believe shed decided i could become engaged formally to one or the other when i was eighteen marriage at twenty first child at twentytwo she had it all worked out but you didnt cooperate i didnt get the chance i might very well have cooperated i found it very difficult to oppose her she brooded over that for a moment then washed it away with more champagne but gloria seduced them both at the same time in the front parlor while my parents were attending the opera i believe it was vivaldi anywayвђ she waved her hand again drank again they came home found this situation there was quite a scene i snuck downstairs and watched part of it they were nakedвђnot my parents naturally high on something too there was a lot of shouting threatening pleadingвђthis from the oxford twins did i mention they were twins no you didnt identical blond pale lanternjawed gloria didnt give two damns about them of course she did it knowing theyd be caught because my mother had chosen them for me she hated me gloria not my mother her brow knit my mother didnt hate me what happened the twins were sent home in disgrace and gloria was punished which led inevitably to her striking back by accusing my fathers friend of seducing her which led to another miserable scene and her finally running off it was certainly less disruptive with her gone but it gave my parents more time to concentrate on forging me i used to wonder why they saw me more as creation than child why they couldnt love me but thenвђ she settled back again im not very lovable no ones ever loved me aching for her the woman and the child he set his glass aside and framed her face gently with his hands youre wrong no im not her smile was soaked in wine im a professional i know these things my parents never loved me certainly gloria didnt the husband who didnt count didnt love me there wasnt even one of those kindly goodhearted servants you read about in books who held me against her soft generous bosom and loved me no one even bothered to pretend enough to use the words you on the other hand are very lovable she ran her free hand up his chest ive never had sex when ive been drunk what do you suppose its like sybill he caught her hand before she could distract him they underestimated and undervalued you you shouldnt do the same to yourself phillip she leaned forward managed to nip his bottom lip between her teeth my lifes been a predictable bore until you the first time you kissed me my mind just clicked off no one ever did that to me before and when you touch meвђ slowly she brought their joined hand to her breast my skin gets hot and my heart pounds and my insides get loose and liquid you climbed up the building her mouth roamed over his jaw you brought me roses you wanted me didnt you yes i wanted you but not justвђ take me she let her head fall back so she could look into those wonderful eyes ive never said that to a man before imagine that take me phillip and the words were part plea part promise just take me the empty glass slipped out of her fingers as she wrapped her arms around him helpless to resist he lowered her to the sofa and took the dull ache behind her eyes the more lively one dancing inside her temples was no more than she deserved sybill decided as she tried to drown both of them under the hot spray of the shower she would never as god was her witness overindulge in any form of alcohol again she only wished the aftermath of drink had resulted in memory loss as well as a hangover but she remembered much too clearly the way shed prattled on about herself the things shed told phillip humiliating private things things she rarely even told herself now she had to face him she had to face him and the fact that in one short weekend she had wept in his arms then had given him both her body and her most carefully guarded secrets and she had to face the fact that she was hopelessly and dangerously in love with him which was totally irrational of course the very fact that she believed she could have developed such strong feelings for him in such a short amount of time and association was precisely why those emotions were hopeless and dangerous obviously she wasnt thinking clearly this barrage of feelings that had tumbled into her so quickly made it all but impossible to maintain an objective distance and analyze once seth was settled once all the details were arranged she would have to find that distance again the simplest and most logical method was to begin with geographical distance and go back to new york undoubtedly she would come to her senses once shed picked up the threads of her own life again and slipped back into a comfortable familiar routine however miserably dull that seemed just now she took the time to brush her wet hair back from her face to carefully cream her skin adjust the lapels of her robe if she couldnt quite take full advantage of her breathing techniques to compose herself it was hardly any wonder what with the drag of the hangover but she stepped out of the bathroom with her features calmly arranged then walked into the parlor where phillip was just pouring coffee from the room service tray i thought you could use this yes thank you she carefully censored her gaze to avoid the empty champagne bottle and the scatter of clothing that shed been too drunk to pick up the night before did you take any aspirin yes ill be fine she said it stiffly accepted the cup of coffee and sat with the desperate care of an invalid she knew she was pale holloweyed shed gotten a good look at herself in the steamy mirror and she got a good look at phillip now he wasnt pale at all she noted nor was he holloweyed a lesser woman would despise him for it as she sipped her coffee and studied him her muddled mind began to clear how many times she wondered had he refilled her glass the night before how many times had he refilled his own it seemed to her there was a wide discrepancy between the two resentment began to stir as she watched him generously heap jam on a piece of toast even the thought of food had her shaky stomach lurching hungry she said sweetly starving he took the lid off a plate of scrambled eggs you should try to eat a little shed rather die sleep well yeah and arent we brighteyed and chipper this morning he caught the tone slanted her a cautious look hed wanted to take it slow give her some time to recover before they discussed anything but it appeared that she was recovering rapidly you had a little more to drink than i did he began you got me drunk it was deliberate you charmed your way in here and started pouring champagne into me i hardly held your nose and poured it down your throat you used an apology as an excuse her hands began to shake so she slammed the coffee onto the table you must have known id be angry with you and you thought youd just ease your way into my bed with dom perignon the sex was your idea he reminded her insulted i wanted to talk to you and the fact is i got more out of you after you were buzzed than i ever would have otherwise so i loosened you up and damn if he was going to feel guilty over it and you let me in loosened me up she whispered getting slowly to her feet i wanted to know who you are i have a right to know youвђyou did plan it you planned to come in here to charm me into drinking just a little too much so you could pry into my personal life i care about you he moved toward her but she slapped his hand away dont im not stupid enough to fall for that again i do care about you and now i know more and understand more about you whats wrong with that sybill you tricked me maybe i did he took her arms keeping a firm grip when she tried to pull back just hold on you had a privileged structured childhood i didnt you had advantages servants culture i didnt do you think less of me because until i was twelve i ran the streets no but this has nothing to do with that no one loved me either he continued not until i was twelve so i know what its like on both sides do you expect me to think less of you because you survived the cold im not going to discuss it thats not going to work anymore heres emotion for you sybill he brought his mouth down on hers dragging her into the kiss into the swirl maybe i dont know what to do about it yet either but its there youve seen my scars theyre right out there now ive seen yours he was doing it again making her weaken and want she could rest her head on his shoulder have his arms come around to hold her she only had to ask and couldnt theres no need to feel sorry for me oh baby gently this time he touched his lips to hers yes there is and i admire what you managed to become despite it all i was drinking too much she said quickly i made my parents sound cold and unfeeling did either of them ever tell you they loved you she opened her mouth then sighed we simply werent a demonstrative family not every family is like yours not every family shows their feelings and touches andвђ she trailed off hearing the trace of panicked defense in her own voice for what she wondered wearily for whom no neither of them ever said that to me or to gloria as far as i know and any decent therapist would conclude that their children reacted to this restrictive overly formal and demanding atmosphere by choosing different extremes gloria chose wild behavior as a bid for attention i conformed in a bid for approval she equated sex with affection and power and fantasized about being desired and forced by men in authority including her legal and her biological fathers i avoided intimacy in sex out of fear of failure and selected a field of study where i could safely observe behavior without risk of emotional involvement is that clear enough the operative word id say is chose she chose to hurt you chose not to be hurt thats accurate but you havent been able to keep it up you risked being hurt with seth and youre risking being hurt with me he touched her cheek i dont want to hurt you sybill it was very likely too late to prevent that she thought but she gave in enough to rest her head on his shoulder she didnt have to ask for his arms to come around her lets just see what happens next she decided chapter twenty contents prev fear sybill wrote is a common human emotion and being human it is as complex and difficult to analyze as love and hate greed passion emotions and their causes and effects are not my particular field of study behavior is both learned and instinctive and very often contains no true emotional root behavior is much more simple if no more basic than emotion im afraid im alone in this hotel a grown woman educated intelligent sensible and capable yet im afraid to pick up the phone on the desk and call my own mother a few days ago i wouldnt have termed it fear but reluctance perhaps avoidance a few days ago i would have argued and argued well that contact with her over the issue of seth would only cause disruption in the order of things and produce no constructive results therefore contact would be useless a few days ago i could have rationalized that my feelings for seth stemmed from a sense of moral and familial obligation a few days ago i could and did refuse to acknowledge my envy of the quinns with their noisy and unstructured and undisciplined interactive behavior i would have admitted that their behavior and their unorthodox relationship were interesting but never would i have admitted that i had a yearning to somehow slip into that pattern and become part of it of course i cant i accept that a few days ago i attempted to refute the depth and the meaning of my feelings for phillip love i told myself does not come so quickly or so intensely this is attraction desire even lust but not love its easier to refute than to face im afraid of love of what it demands what it asks what it takes and im more afraid much more of not being loved in return still i can accept this i understand perfectly the limitations of my relationship with phillip we are both adults who have made our own patterns and our own choices he has his needs and his life as i do mine i can be grateful that our paths crossed ive learned a great deal in the short time ive known him a great deal ive learned has been about myself i dont believe ill be quite the same as i was i dont want to be but in order to change truly to grow there are actions that must be taken it helps to write this out even though the order and sense are faulty phillip called just now from baltimore i thought he sounded tired yet excited he had a meeting with his attorney about his fathers life insurance claim for months now the insurance company has refused to settle they instigated an investigation into professor quinns death and held off paying the claim over the suspicion of suicide financially of course it put a strain on the quinns with seth to provide for and a new business to run but they have doggedly pursued legal action over this issue i dont think i realized until today how vital it is to them to win this battle not for the money as i originally assumed but to clear any shadow on their fathers name i dont believe suicide is always an act of cowardice i once considered it myself had the proper note written the necessary pills in my hand but i was only sixteen and understandably foolish naturally i tore the letter up disposed of the pills and put the matter aside suicide would have been rude inconvenient for my family doesnt that sound bitter i had no idea id harbored all this anger but the quinns ive learned considered the taking of ones own life selfish cowardly they have refused all along to accept or to allow others to believe that this man they love so much was capable of such a singular selfish act now it appears they will win this battle the insurance company has offered to settle phillip believes my deposition may have swayed them toward this response he may be right of course the quinns are perhaps genetically illsuited to settlements all or nothing is precisely how phillip put it to me he believes as does his attorney that they will have all very shortly im happy for them though i never had the privilege of meeting raymond and stella quinn i feel i know them through my association with their family professor quinn deserves to rest in peace just as seth deserves to take the quinn name and to have the security of a family who will love and care for him i can do something to ensure that all of that happens i will have to make this call i will have to take a stand oh my hands shake just at the possibility im such a coward no seth would call me a wimp thats somehow worse she terrifies me there it is in black and white my own mother terrifies me she never raised a hand to me rarely raised her voice yet she shoved me into a mold of her own making i barely struggled my father he was too busy being important to notice oh yes i see a great deal of anger here i can call her i can use the very status that she insisted i achieve to gain what i want from her im a respected scientist in some small way a public figure if i tell her ill use that if i make her believe i will unless she provides a written statement to the quinns attorney detailing the circumstances of glorias birth admitting that professor quinn attempted several times to contact her for verification of glorias paternity she will despise me but she will do it i only have to pick up the phone to do for seth what i failed to do years ago i can give him a home a family and the knowledge that he has nothing to fear son of a bitch phillip wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand blood from a nasty but shallow scrape smeared over his skin he grinned like an idiot at the hull he and his brothers had just turned thats a big bastard its a beautiful bastard cam rolled his aching shoulders the turning of the hull meant more than progress it meant success boats by quinn was doing it again and they were doing it right shes got a fine line ethan ran a calloused hand over the planking a pretty shape to her when i start thinking a hull looks sexy cam decided im going home to my wife well we can score her waterline and get back to work or we can just admire her for a while you score her waterline phillip suggested im going up and running the paperwork for the draw its time to hit your old racing pal up for some cash we can use it you cut the paychecks ethan asked him yeah yours i dontвђ need it cam finished cut one anyway goddamn it buy your sexy lady some bauble with it blow it on some overpriced wine or lay it on the throw of the dice but cut your check this week he studied the hull again it means something this week maybe it does phillip agreed the insurance companys going to fold their hand cam added were going to win there people are already changing their tune ethan rubbed a layer of sawdust off the planking the ones who wanted to whistle lies under their breath weve already won there you worked the hardest to make sure we did he said to phillip im just the detail man either one of you tried to have more than a fiveminute conversation with a lawyerвђ well youd nod off from boredom ethan and cam would end up punching him i won by default maybe cam grinned at him but you skated out of a lot of the real work by talking on the phone writing letters zinging off faxes it just comes down to you being secretary without the great legs and ass not only is that sexist but i do have great legs and a terrific ass oh yeah lets see em he moved fast diving and taking phillip down onto that reputedly terrific ass foolish scrambled up from his nap by the lumber and raced over to join in christ are you crazy laughter prevented phillip from rolling free get off me you moron give me a hand here ethan cam grinned swearing as foolish lapped eagerly at his face phillip struggled halfheartedly when cam sat on him come on he urged when ethan merely shook his head whens the last time you pantsed somebody been a while ethan considered as phillip began to struggle in earnest maybe the last time was junior crawford at his bachelor party well thats ten years ago anyway cam grunted as phillip nearly succeeded in bucking him off come on hes put on some muscle the last few months and hes feisty maybe for old times sake getting into the spirit ethan evaded a couple of wellaimed kicks and got a firm hold on the waistband of phillips jeans excuse me was the best sybill could manage when she walked in on air blue with curses and the sight of phillip being held down on the beatenwood floor while his brothersвђ well she couldnt quite tell what they were trying to do hey cam avoided a fist to the jaw barely and grinned hugely at her want to give us a hand were just trying to get his pants off he was bragging about his legs iвђhmmm let him up now cam youre embarrassing her hell ethan shes seen his legs before but without ethan lending his weight it was either let go or get bloody it seemed simpler if less fun to let go well finish up later my brothers forgot theyre out of high school phillip got to his feet brushing off his jeans and his dignity they were feeling a little rambunctious because we turned the hull oh she shifted her attention to the boat and her eyes widened youve made so much progress its got a ways to go yet ethan studied it himself visualizing it complete deck cabin bridge belowdecks man wants a damn hotel suite in there as long as hes paying for it phillip crossed to sybill ran a hand down her hair sorry i got in too late to see you last night thats all right i know youve been busy with work and the lawyer she shifted her purse from hand to hand actually i have something that may help with the lawyer with both situations wellвђ she reached into her purse and took out a manila envelope its a statement from my mother two copies both notarized i had her overnight them i didnt want to say anything until theyd arrived and id read them to seeвђ i think theyll be useful whats the deal cam demanded as phillip quickly skimmed the neatly typed twopage statement it confirms that gloria was dads biological daughter that he was unaware of it and that he attempted to contact barbara griffin several times during a period from last december to this march theres a letter from dad written to her in january telling her about seth his agreement with gloria to take custody i read your fathers letter sybill told him perhaps i shouldnt have but i did if he was angry with my mother it didnt show in the words he just wanted her to tell him if it was true he was going to help seth anyway but he wanted to be able to give him his birthright a man who worried that much about a child would hardly have taken his own life he had too much to give and was too ready to give it im so sorry he just needs a chance and a choice ethan read when phillip passed the letters to him then cleared his throat i couldnt give one to gloria if shes mine and she wont take it now but ill see that seth has both whether hes mine by blood or not hes mine nonetheless now it sounds like him seth should read this why did she agree to this now sybill phillip asked her i convinced her that it was best for all concerned no he caught her chin in his hand lifted her face to his theres more i know there is i promised her that her name and the details would be kept as private as possible she made a restless little movement then let out a breath and i threatened to write a book telling the entire story if she didnt do this you blackmailed her phillip said with stunned admiration i gave her a choice she chose this one it was hard for you it was necessary now he put both of his hands on her face gently it was hard and brave and brilliant logical she began then shut her eyes and yes hard she and my father are very angry they may not forgive me theyre capable of not forgiving they dont deserve you the point is seth deserves you soвђ she trailed off as he closed his mouth over hers okay move aside cam elbowed phillip away and took sybill by the shoulders you did good he said then kissed her with a firmness that made her blink oh was all she managed your turn cam stated then gave her a gentle nudge toward ethan my parents would have been proud of you he kissed her in turn then patted her shoulders when her eyes filled oh no dont let her do that instantly cam took her arm and pulled her back to phillip no crying in here no crying allowed in the boatyard cam gets jittery when women cry im not crying they always say that cam muttered but they never mean it outside anybody who cries has to do it outside its a new rule chuckling phillip pulled sybill toward the door come on i want a minute alone with you anyway im not crying i just never expected your brothers toвђ its not usual for me to beвђ she stopped herself its very nice to be shown youre appreciated and liked i appreciate you he drew her close i like you and its very nice she indulged in the luxury of both ive already spoken with your attorney and with anna i didnt want to fax the papers from the hotel as i did give my word the contents would be kept private but both of them agree that this last document should move everything along anna believes that your petition for permanent guardianship will go through as early as next week that soon theres nothing in the way of it you and your brothers are professor quinns legal sons seth is his grandchild his mother agreed in writing to transfer custody reneging on that might stall the decree but no one believes at this point that it would change it seth is eleven and at his age his desires would be taken into account annas going to push for a hearing early next week it seems strange it all coming together like this all at once yes she looked up as a flock of geese swept overhead seasons change she thought i thought i would walk down to the school id like to talk to him tell him some of this myself i think thats a good idea you timed it well im good at schedules how about scheduling a family meal tonight at the quinns to celebrate yes all right ill walk him back here great hold on a minute he went back inside returning moments later with a very energetic foolish on a red leash he could use a walk too oh well iвђ he knows the way all you have to do is hold on to this end amused phillip stuck the leash in her hand then watched her eyes go wide as foolish made his dash tell him to heel phillip shouted as sybill trotted after the dog he wont but itll sound like you know what youre doing this is not funny she muttered it as she jogged awkwardly after foolish slow down heel god he not only slowed but stopped burying his nose in a hedge with such determination she was terrified he would race through it and take her with him but he only lifted his leg and looked immensely pleased with himself by her count he lifted his leg eight times before they turned the corner down from the school and she caught sight of the buses what kind of a bladder do you have she demanded looking hopefully for seth while she struggled to cling to the leash and prevent foolish from rocketing toward the crowd of children pouring out of the building no sit stay you might bite someone foolish slanted her a look that seemed to say please get serious but he sat smacking her heels rhythmically with his tail hell be along in a minute she began then let out a yelp as foolish leaped up and raced forward hed spotted seth first and was running on love no no no no sybill panted uselessly just as seth caught sight of them he let out a yelp himself of pure joy and dashed toward the dog as if theyd been cruelly separated for years hey hi seth laughed as foolish made one adoring leap and bathed his face hows it going boy good dog youre a good dog belatedly he looked over at sybill hey hey yourself here she shoved the leash into his hand not that he pays any attention to it weve kind of had trouble with leash training no kidding but she managed a smile now to include seth and danny and will when they hurried up behind him i thought id walk back to the boatyard with you i wanted to talk to you sure thats cool she stepped determinedly out of foolishs path then quickly back again as a brightred sports car screamed up to the curb and stopped with a wild squeal of brakes before she could snarl at the driver that he was in a school zone she saw gloria in the passenger seat sybills movement was fast and instinctive she put seth protectively behind her well well well gloria drawled and eyed them both out of the window go get your brothers sybill ordered seth go right now but he couldnt move he could only stand and stare while the fear settled in his stomach like balls of ice i wont go with her i wont go i wont no you wont she took his hand firmly in hers danny will run to the boatyard right now tell the quinns we need them hurry go straight there she heard the smack of running sneakers on the sidewalk but didnt look she kept her eyes trained on her sister as gloria slipped out of the car hey kid miss me what do you want gloria everything i can get she fisted a hand on the hip of her lipstickred jeans and winked at seth wanna go for a ride kiddo we can do some catching up im not going anywhere with you he wished he had run he had a place in the woods a place hed picked out and fixed up a hiding place but it was too far away then he felt sybills hand warm and strong on his im not ever going with you again youll do what the hell i tell you fury flashed in her eyes as she started forward for the first time in his life foolish bared his teeth and growled a vicious threat call off that fucking dog no sybill said it simply quietly and felt a surge of love for foolish id keep my distance gloria hell bite she scanned the car the leatherjacketed man behind its wheel beating a rhythm on the dash to the blasting radio it looks like you landed on your feet yeah petes okay were heading out to california hes got connections i need cash youre not going to get it here gloria pulled out a cigarette smiling at sybill as she lit it look i dont want the kid but im going to take him unless i get a stake the quinnsll pay to get him back everybodys happy no harm done if you mess with me on this syb im going to tell pete to get out of the car foolish shifted from growling to snarling sharp canine teeth bared sybill raised a brow go ahead tell him i want whats due me goddamn it youve had more than your due all your life bullshit it was you who got everything the perfect daughter i hate your fucking guts ive hated you all my life she grabbed sybill by the front of her jacket and all but spit in her face i wish you were dead i know that now take your hands off me you think you can make me with a laugh gloria shoved sybill back a step you never had the guts before did you youll take it and youll take it and youll give me what i want just like always shut that dog up she shouted at seth as foolish strained at the leash and snapped wildly shut him up and get in the goddamn car before iвђ sybill didnt see her own hand come up didnt realize the order had gone from her brain to her arm but she felt her muscles tighten her rage erupt and then gloria was sprawled on the ground gaping at her you get in the goddamn car she said evenly not even looking at the jeep that screeched up to the curb not blinking when foolish dragged himself and seth closer and growled low in his throat at the woman on the ground you go to california or you go to hell but you stay away from this boy and you stay away from me keep out of this she snapped at phillip as he and his brothers burst out of the jeep get in the car and go gloria or ill pay you back right now for everything you ever did to seth everything you ever did to me get up and go or when the cops get here to take you in for jumping bail when we add charges of child abuse and extortion there wont be much left of you to put in a cell when gloria didnt move sybill reached down and with a strength born of fury hauled her to her feet get in the car and go and dont ever try to get near this boy again you wont get through me gloria i swear to you i dont want the damn kid i just want some money cut your losses im not going to bother holding that dog or the quinns back after another thirty seconds want to take all of us on gloria are you coming or not the driver flicked his cigarette out the car window i dont have all day to hang around this bumfuck town yeah im coming she tossed her head youre welcome to him all he ever did was slow me down and get in my way im going to score big in la i dont need anything from you good sybill murmured as gloria climbed back in the car because youll never get anything from me again you knocked her down seth wasnt shaking nor was he pale now as the sports car shrieked away the look he sent sybill was filled with gratitude and with awe you knocked her down i guess i did are you all right she never even looked at me really foolish was going to bite her hes a wonderful dog when he leaped on her now she pressed her face into the warmth of his neck hes a fabulous dog but you knocked her down sybill knocked her right on her butt he shouted as phillip and his brothers walked over so i saw phillip put a hand to her cheek nice going champ how do you feel i feelвђ fine she realized no cramping no chills no sick headache i feel just fine then she blinked as seth threw his arms around her you were great shes never coming back you scared the shit out of her the bubbly little laugh that rose into her throat caught her by surprise leaning down she buried her face in seths hair everythings just the way its supposed to be now lets go home phillip slid his arm around her shoulders lets all go home hes going to be telling that story for days phillip decided weeks hes already embellishing on it amazingly serene sybill walked with phillip by the waters edge while the heroic foolish romped in the yard behind them with simon the way he tells it now i beat gloria to a pulp and foolish lapped up the blood you dont sound all that displeased by it i never knocked anyone down before in my life never stood my ground that way i wish i could say i did it all for seth but i think part of it was for me too she wont come back phillip she lost she is lost i dont think seth will ever be afraid of her again hes home this is a good place she turned in a circle to take in the trim house the woods going deep with twilight the last sparkle of the sun on the water ill miss it when im back in new york new york youre not going for a while yet actually im planning on going back right after the hearing next week it was something shed made up her mind on she needed to resume her own life staying longer would accomplish nothing but adding to the emotional mess wait why i have work youre working here where did the panic come from he wondered who pushed the button i have meetings with my publisher that ive put off i need to get back i cant live in a hotel forever and seths settled now he needs you around heвђ ill visit and im hoping hell be allowed to come see me occasionally shed worked it all out in her head and now she turned to smile at him i promised to take him to a yankees game next spring it was as if it were already done he realized struggling against that panic as if she were already gone youve talked to him about it yes i thought i should let him know and this is how you let me know he shot back its been nice pal see you around im not sure im following nothing nothing to follow he walked away he wanted his own life back too didnt he here was his chance end of complications all he had to do was wish her well and wave goodbye thats what i want its always been what i wanted excuse me im not looking for anything else neither one of us was he whirled back to her temper glinting in his eyes right im not sure what you mean youve got your life ive got mine we just followed the current and here we are time to get out of the water no she decided she wasnt following him all right well then assuring himself that he was fine with it he was calm he was even pleased he started back toward her the last of the sun shimmered over her hair into those impossibly clear eyes shadowed the hollow of her throat above the collar of her blouse no he heard himself say it and his mouth went dry no a minute just one minute he walked away again this time to the edge of the water he stood there staring down like a man contemplating diving in well over his head whats wrong with baltimore baltimore nothing its got museums good restaurants character theater its a very nice city sybill said cautiously why cant you work there if you have to go into new york for a meeting you can hop the shuttle or the train hell you can drive it in under four hours im sure thats true if youre suggesting i relocate to baltimoreвђ its perfect youd still be living in the city but youd be able to see seth whenever you wanted and you she thought yearning toward the picture but she shook her head it would kill her to go on this way and she knew it would spoil the happiness shed had the new self shed discovered its just not practical phillip of course its practical he turned around strode back to her its perfectly practical whats impractical is going back to new york putting up that distance again its not going to work sybill its just not going to work theres no point in discussing it now do you think this is easy for me he exploded i have to stay here i have commitments responsibilities to say nothing of roots ive got no choice why cant you bend i dont understand i have to spell it out damn it he took her by the shoulders gave her a quick impatient shake dont you get it i love you you cant expect me to let you walk away you have to stay the hell with your life and my life your family my family i want our life i want our family she stared at him the blood ringing in her ears what what you heard what i said you saidвђ you said you loved me do you mean it no im lying iвђ ive already knocked one person down today i can do it again just then she thought she could do anything anything at all it didnt matter if there was fury in his eyes if his fingers were digging into her arms if he looked fit to kill she could handle this she could handle him she could handle anything if you meant it she said her voice admirably cool id like you to say it again ive never heard it before i love you calming he touched his lips to her brow i want you to each temple i need you to stay with me then her mouth give me more time to show you what well be like together i know what well be like together i want what well be like together she let out a shuddering breath resisted the urge to close her eyes she needed to see his face to remember it exactly as it was at this moment with the sun sinking the sky going peach and rose and a flock of birds winging overhead i love you i was afraid to tell you i dont know why i dont think im afraid of anything now are you going to ask me to marry you i was about to muddle my way through that part on impulse he pulled out the simple white band holding back her hair and tossed it over her shoulders where the dogs gave loud and delighted chase i want your hair in my hands he murmured threading his fingers through the thick rich brown all my life i said i would never do this because there would never be a woman who would make me need to or want to i was wrong i found one i found mine marry me sybill all my life i said i would never do this because there would never be a man whod need me or want me or matter enough to make me want i was wrong i found you marry me phillip and soon how does next saturday strike you oh emotion flooded her heart poured into it out of it warm and smooth and real yes she leaped throwing her arms around him he spun her in a circle and for a moment just for a flash he thought he saw two figures standing on the dock the man with silver hair and brilliantly blue eyes the woman with freckles dancing over her face and wild red hair blowing in the evening breeze their hands were linked they were there then they were gone this one counts he murmured holding her hard and close this one counts for both of us
