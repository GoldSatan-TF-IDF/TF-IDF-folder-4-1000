the traveller by clark ashton smith stranger where goest thou in the sad raiment of a pilgrim with shattered sandals retaining the dustand mire of so many devious ways with thy brows that alien suns have darkened and thy hair made whitefrom the cold rime of alien moons wanderest thou in search of the cities greater than rome with walls of opal and crystal and fanes more white than the summer clouds or the foam of hyperboreal seas or farest thou to the lands unpeopled and unexplored to the sunless deserts lit by the baleful and calamitous beacons of volcanoes or seekest thou an extremer shore where the red and monstrous lilies are like a royal pageant pausing with innumerable flambeaux held aloft on the verge of the waveless waters nay it is none of these that i seek but forevermore i seek the city and the land of my former home in the quest thereof i have wandered from the first immemorable years of my youth till now and have mingled the dust of many realms of many highways in my garments hem i have seen the cities greater than rome and the fanes more white than the clouds of summer the lands unpeopled and unexplored and the land that is thronged by the red and monstrous lilies even the far aerial walls of the cities of mirage and the saffron meadows of sunset i have seen but nevermore the city and land of my former home where lieth the land of thine home and by what name shall we know it and distinguish the rumour thereof among the rumours of many lands alas i know not where it lieth nor in the broad black scrolls of geographers and the charts of old seamen who have sailed to the marge of the seventh sea is the place thereof recorded and its name i have never learned howbeit i have learned the name of empires lying beneath stars to us invisible in many languages have i spoken in barbarous tongues unknown to babel and i have heard the speech of many men even of them that inhabit the strangle isles of the sea of fire and the sea of snow thunder and lutes and battledrums the unceasing querulousness of gnats and the stupendous moaning of the simoon lyres of ebony damascened with crystal bells of malachite with golden clappers the song of exotic birds that sigh like women or sob like fountains whispers and shoutings of fire the multitudinous mutter of cities asleep the manifold tumult of cities at dawn and the slow and weary murmur of desertwandering streamsall all have i herd but never in any place from my tongue a word or syllable that resembled in the least in the name i would learn
