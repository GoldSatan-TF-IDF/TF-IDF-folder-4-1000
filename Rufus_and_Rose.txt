rufus and rose or the fortunes of rough and ready by horatio alger jr author of ragged dick fame and fortune mark the match boy rough and ready ben the luggage boy campaign series luck and pluck series etc philadelphia porter coates to my young friends henry and eugene this volume is affectionately dedicated preface in presenting to the public the last volume of the ragged dick series the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded both by the press and the public to these stories of street life several of the characters are drawn from life and nearly all of the incidents are of actual occurrence indeed the materials have been found so abundant that invention has played but a subordinate part the principal object proposed in the preparation of these volumes has been to show that the large class of street boys numbering thousands in new york alone furnishes material out of which good citizens may be made if the right influences are brought to bear upon them in every case therefore the author has led his hero step by step from vagabondage to a position of respectability and in so doing has incurred the charge in some quarters of exaggeration it can easily be shown however that he has fallen short of the truth rather than exceeded it in proof the following extract from an article in a new york daily paper is submitted as a class the newsboys of new york are worthy of more than common attention the requirements of the trade naturally tend to develop activity both of mind and body and in looking over some historical facts we find that many of our most conspicuous public men have commenced their careers as newsboys many of the principal offices of our city government and our chief police courts testify to the truth of this assertion from the west we learn that many of the most enterprising journalists spring from the same stock not long since while on a western journey the superintendent of the lodging house in park place found one of his boys filling the position of district attorney in a western state another settled as a clergyman and still others prosperous and even wealthy business men these facts are full of encouragement for those who are laboring to redeem and elevate the street boy and train him up to fill a respectable position in society though the six volumes already issued complete his original purpose the author finds that he has by no means exhausted his subject and is induced to announce a second series devoted to still other phases of street life this will shortly be commenced under the general name of the tattered tom series new york november list of illustrations dont you try to fool me ill teach you to do it again rufus and rose or the fortunes of rough and ready chapter i new plans so this is to be your first day in wall street rufus said miss manning yes said rufus ive retired from the newspaper business on a large fortune and now im going into business in wall street just to occupy my time the last speaker was a stout wellgrown boy of fifteen with a pleasant face calculated to inspire confidence he looked manly and selfreliant and firm of purpose for years he had been a newsboy plying his trade in the streets of new york and by his shrewdness and a certain ready wit joined with attention to business he had met with better success than most of his class he had been a leader among them and had received the name of rough and ready suggested in part no doubt by his name rufus but the appellation described not inaptly his prominent traits he understood thoroughly how to take care of himself and thought it no hardship that at an age when most boys are tenderly cared for he was sent out into the streets to shift for himself his mother had been dead for some time his stepfather james martin was a drunkard and he had been compelled to take away his little sister rose from the miserable home in which he had kept her and had undertaken to support her as well as himself he had been fortunate enough to obtain a home for her with miss manning a poor seamstress whom he paid for her services in taking care of rose his stepfather in order to thwart and torment him had stolen the little girl away and kept her in brooklyn for a while until rufus got a clue to her whereabouts and succeeded in getting her back at the time when the story opens he had just recovered her and having been fortunate enough to render an important service to mr turner a wall street broker was on this monday morning to enter his office at a salary of eight dollars a week this sketch of the newsboys earlier history is given for the benefit of those who have not read the book called rough and ready in which it is related at length it is necessary to add that rufus was in some sense a capitalist having five hundred dollars deposited in a savingsbank to his credit of this sum he had found three hundred one day which as no claimant ever appeared for it he had been justified in appropriating to his own use the remainder had been given him by mr turner in partial acknowledgment of the service before referred to your new life will seem strange to you at first rufus said miss manning yes it does already when i woke up this morning i was going to jump out of bed in a hurry thinking i must go round to nassau street to get my papers then all at once i thought that id given up being a newsboy but it seemed queer i didnt know but youd gone back to your old business said the seamstress pointing to a paper in his hand its this mornings herald explained rufus you and rose will have to be looking for another room where martin cant find you youll find two columns of advertisements of boarders and lodgers wanted so you can take your choice ill go out this morning said the seamstress all right take rose along with you or you may find her missing when you get back there was considerable reason to fear that the stepfather james martin would make a fresh attempt to get possession of rose and rufus felt that it was prudent to guard against this have you had breakfast rufus yes i got breakfast at the lodging house here it may be remarked that rufus had enjoyed advantages superior to most of his class and spoke more correctly in general but occasionally fell into modes of pronunciation such as he was accustomed to hear from his street associates he had lately devoted a part of his evenings to study under the superintendence of miss manning who coming originally from a country home had had a good commonschool education its time i was going down to the office said rufus goodmorning miss manning goodmorning rosy as he stooped to kiss his little sister a pretty little girl of eight goodmorning rufie dont let mr martin carry you off i think hed have a harder job to carry me off than you rosy said rufus laughing dont engage lodgings on fifth avenue miss manning im afraid it would take more than i can earn in wall street to pay my share of the expense i shall be content with an humbler home said the seamstress smiling rufus left the little room which by the way looked out on franklin street near the hudson river and the seamstress taking the herald turned to the column of boarders and lodgers wanted there was a long list but the greater part of the rooms advertised were quite beyond her slender means remembering that it would be prudent to get out of their present neighborhood in order to put the drunken stepfather off the track she looked for places farther up town the objection to this however was that prices advance as you go up town still the streets near the river are not considered so eligible and she thought that they might find something there she therefore marked one place on spring street another on leroy street and still another though with some hesitation on christopher street she feared that rufus would object to this as too far up town now put on your things rose and well take a walk that will be nice said rose and the little girl ran to get her shawl and bonnet when she was dressed for the street rose would hardly have been taken for the sister of a newsboy she had a pretty face full of vivacity and intelligence and her brothers pride in her had led him to dress her better than might have been expected from his small means many children of families in good circumstances were less neatly and tastefully dressed than rose taking the little girl by the hand miss manning led the way down the narrow staircase it was far from a handsome house in which they had thus far made their home the wallpaper was torn from the walls in places revealing patches of bare plastering there was a faded and worn oilcloth upon the stairs while outside the rooms at intervals along the entry were buckets of dirty water and rubbish which had been temporarily placed there by the occupants as it was monday washing was going on in several of the rooms and the vapor arising from hot suds found its way into the entry from one or two halfopen doors on the whole it was not a nice or savory home and the seamstress felt no regret in leaving it but the question was would she be likely to find a better the seamstress made her way first to spring street she was led to infer from the advertisement that she might find cheap accommodations but when she found herself in front of the house designated she found it so dirty and neglected in appearance that she did not feel like entering she was sure it would not suit her next she went to leroy street here she found a neatlooking threestory brick house she rang the bell you advertise a room to let she said to the servant can i look at it ill speak to the missis said the girl soon a portly lady made her appearance you have a room to let said miss manning interrogatively yes can i look at it its for a gentleman said the landlady i dont take ladies besides its rather expensive and she glanced superciliously at the plain attire of the seamstress of course there was no more to be said so miss manning and rose found their way into the street once more the last on the list was christopher street come rose are you tired of walking oh no said the child i can walk ever so far without getting tired christopher street is only three blocks from leroy in less than ten minutes they found themselves before the house advertised it was a fairlooking house but the seamstress found on inquiry that the room was a large one on the second floor and that the rent would be beyond her means she was now at the end of her list i think rose she said we will go to washington square and sit down on one of the seats i shall have to look over the paper again this square is a park of considerable size comprising very nearly ten acres up to it had been for years used as a potters field or public cemetery and it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand bodies were buried there but in it became a park there is a basin and a fountain in the centre and it is covered with trees of considerable size at frequent intervals there are benches for the accommodation of those who desire to pass an hour or two in the shade of the trees in the afternoon particularly may be seen a large number of children playing in the walks and nursemaids drawing their young charges in carriages or sitting with them on the seats rose was soon busied in watching the sports of some children of her own age while miss manning carefully scanned the advertisements but she found nothing to reward her search at length her attention was drawn to the following advertisement no waverley place two small rooms terms reasonable that must be close by thought the seamstress she was right for waverley place commencing at broadway runs along the northern side of washington square before the uptown movement commenced it was a fashionable quarter and even now as may be inferred from the character of the houses is a very nice and respectable street particularly that part which fronts the square miss manning could see the number mentioned from where she was seated and saw at a glance that it was a nice house of course it was beyond her means she said that to herself still prompted by an impulse which she did not attempt to resist she determined to call and make inquiries about the rooms advertised chapter ii the house in waverley place leaving the park miss manning crossed the street went up the front steps of a handsome house and rang the bell what a nice house said rose admiringly are we going to live here no i dont think we can afford it but i will ask to see the rooms soon the door was opened and a servantgirl looked at them inquiringly can i see the rooms you have to let asked the seamstress step in a moment and ill call mrs clayton they stepped into a hall and remained waiting till a woman of middle age with a pleasant countenance came up from below where she had been superintending the servants i saw your advertisement of rooms to let commenced miss manning a little timidly for she knew that the house was a finer one than with her limited means she could expect to enter and felt a little like a humbug yes i have two small rooms vacant are they expensive asked the seamstress with hesitation i ought to say that only one is at my disposal said the landlady and that is a hall bedroom on the third floor back the other is a square room nicely furnished on the upper floor large enough for two but last evening after i had sent in the advertisement mrs colman who occupies my second floor front told me she intended to get a young lady to look after her two little girls during the day and teach them and would wish her to occupy the larger room i thought when i first saw you that you were going to apply for the situation a sudden thought came to miss manning why could she not undertake this office it would pay her much better than sewing and the children would be companions for rose how old are the little girls she said one is five the other seven years old mrs colman is an invalid and does not feel able to have the children with her all the time is mrs colman at home yes would you like to see her i should i am fond of children and i might be willing to undertake the charge of hers if she thought fit to intrust them to me i think it quite likely you can come to an agreement she was wondering this morning where she could hear of a suitable person wait here a moment and i will go and speak to her mrs clayton went upstairs and returned shortly mrs colman would like to see you she said i will lead the way miss manning followed the landlady upstairs and was ushered into a large handsomely furnished room on the second floor there was a cheerful fire in the grate and beside it in an easychair sat a lady looking nervous and in delicate health two little girls who seemed full of the health and vitality which their mother lacked were romping noisily on the floor mrs colman said the landlady this is the young lady i spoke of take a seat please said mrs colman politely i am an invalid as you see mrs here she looked up inquiringly miss manning said the seamstress then the little girl is not yours not mine but i have the care of her as her mother is dead how old is she eight a little older than my jennie are you fond of children miss manning very much so i am looking for some one who will look after my little girls during the day and teach them at present they know absolutely nothing and i have not been willing to send them out of the house to school what i have been thinking is of securing some one who would live in the house and take the care of the children off my hands i am an invalid as you see and sometimes their noise absolutely distracts me miss manning was struck with pity as she noticed the pale nervous face of the invalid then the children need to go out and take a walk every day but i have no one to send with them you wouldnt object to that would you no i should like it could you come soon i could come tomorrow if you desire it said miss manning promptly i wish you would i have a nervous headache which will last me some days i suppose and the children cant keep still i suppose it is their nature to be noisy i can take them out for an hour now if you like it mrs colman it would give me a chance to get acquainted would you it would be quite a relief to me and to them too oh there is one thing we must speak of what compensation will satisfy you i dont know how much i ought to ask i am willing to leave that matter to you you would want your little girl to live with you i suppose yes she needs me to look after her very well then i will pay mrs clayton for the board of both of you and if two dollars a week would satisfy you would satisfy her miss mannings breath was quite taken away at the magnificent prospect that opened before her she could hardly conceive it possible that her services were worth a home in so nice a house and two dollars a week besides why toiling early and late at her needle she had barely earned hitherto thirtyseven cents a day and out of that all her expenses had to be paid now she would still be able to sew while the children were learning their lessons she would no longer be the occupant of a miserable tenement house but would live in a nice quarter of the city she felt devoutly thankful for the change but on the whole considered that perhaps it was not best to let mrs colman see just how glad she was so she simply expressed herself as entirely satisfied with the terms that were offered mrs colman seemed glad that this matter had been so easily arranged mrs clayton will show you the room you are to occupy she said i have not been into it but i understand that it is very comfortable if there is any addition in the way of furniture which you may require i will make it at my own expense thank you you are very kind here mrs clayton reappeared and at the request of mrs colman offered to show them the room which they were to occupy it is on the upper floor she said apologetically but it is of good size and pleasant when you get to it she led the way into the room it was as she had said a pleasant one well lighted and of good size a thick woollen carpet covered the floor there were a bureau a clothespress a table and other articles needful to make it comfortable after the poor room they had occupied it looked very attractive i think i shall like it said miss manning with satisfaction are we to live here asked rose who had not quite understood the nature of the arrangement yes rosy do you think you shall like it oh yes ever so much when are we coming tomorrow morning you will have two little girls to play with the little girls i saw in that ladys room downstairs yes do you think you shall like it i think it will be very nice said rose with satisfaction well how do you like the room miss manning said mrs colman when they had returned from upstairs it looks very pleasant i have no doubt i shall like it i think you will need a rockingchair and a sofa i will ask mr colman to step into some upholsterers as he goes down town tomorrow and send them up if it wouldnt be too much trouble miss manning i will ask you to help carrie and jennie on with their hats and cloaks they quite enjoy the thought of a run out of doors with you and your little girl by the way what is her name rose a very pretty name i have no doubt the three children will soon become excellent friends she seems a nice little girl rose is a nice little girl said the seamstress affectionately in a short time they were on their way downstairs in the hall below they met the landlady once more what is the price of your hall bedroom mrs clayton asked miss manning five dollars and a half a week was the answer it needs to be mentioned that this was in the day of low prices and that such an apartment now with board would cost at least twelve dollars a week what made you ask miss manning said rose i was thinking that perhaps rufus might like to take it oh i wish he would said rose then we would all be together we are speaking of her brother said miss manning turning to mrs clayton how old is he fifteen is he at school or in a place he is in a brokers office in wall street then as he is the little girls brother i will say only five dollars a week for the room thank you mrs clayton i will let you know what he decides upon tomorrow they went out to walk going as far as union square where miss manning sat down on a bench and let the children sport at will it is needless to say that they very soon got well acquainted and after an hour and a half which their bright eyes testified to their having enjoyed miss manning carried the little colmans back to waverley place and with rose took the horsecars back to their old home wont rufie be surprised when he hears about it said rose yes rosy i think he will said miss manning chapter iii james martins vicissitudes while miss manning is seeking a new boardingplace for herself and rose events are taking place in brooklyn which claim our attention it is here that james martin the shiftless and drunken stepfather of rufus and rose has made a temporary residence he had engaged board at the house of a widow mrs waters and for two or three weeks paid his board regularly being employed at his trade of a carpenter on some houses going up near by but it was not in james martins nature to work steadily at anything his love of drink had spoiled a once good and industrious workman and there seemed to be little chance of any permanent improvement in his character or habits for a time rufus used to pay him over daily the most of his earnings as a newsboy and with this he managed to live miserably enough without doing much himself but after a while rufus became tired of this arrangement and withdrew himself and his sister to another part of the town thus throwing martin on his own resources out of spite martin contrived to kidnap rose but as we have seen her brother had now succeeded in recovering her after losing rose martin took the way back to his boardinghouse feeling rather doubtful of his reception from mrs waters to whom he was owing a weeks board which he was quite unable to pay he had told her that he would pay the bill as soon as he could exchange a fiftydollar note which it is needless to say was only an attempt at deception since he did not even possess fifty cents on entering the house he went at once to his room and lay down on the bed till the supperbell rang then he came down and took his place at the table with the rest of the boarders wheres your little girl mr martin inquired mrs waters missing rose shes gone on a visit to some of her relations in new york answered martin with some degree of truth how long is she to stay till she can have some new clothes made up maybe two or three weeks thats rather sudden isnt it you didnt think of her going this morning no answered martin with his mouth full of toast but she teased so hard to go i let her shes a troublesome child i shall be glad to have the care of her off my mind for a time this might be true but mrs waters was beginning to lose confidence in mr martins statements she felt that it was the part of prudence to make sure of the money he was already owing her and then on some pretext get rid of him when supper was over martin rose and was about to go out but mrs waters was too quick for him mr martin she said may i speak to you a moment yes maam answered martin turning reluctantly i suppose you are ready to pay my bill i need the money particularly ill pay it tomorrow mrs waters you promised to pay me as soon as you changed a bill and this morning you said you should have a chance to change it as you were going to buy your little girl some new clothes i know i did said martin feeling cornered i suppose therefore you can pay me the money tonight said mrs waters sharply why the fact is mrs waters said martin awkwardly i was very unfortunate as i was sitting in the horsecar coming home i had my pocket picked of all the money i got in change there was some over forty dollars im sorry said mrs waters coldly for she did not believe a word of this but i need my money if it hadnt been for that id have paid you tonight theres only one word i have to say mr martin said the landlady provoked if you cant pay me you must find another boardingplace ill attend to it in a day or two i guess i can get the money tomorrow if you cant pay me tonight youll oblige me by giving up your room tomorrow morning im a poor widder mr martin and i must look out for number one i cant afford to keep boarders that dont pay their bills there was one portion of this speech that set mr martin to thinking mrs waters was a widow he was a widower by marrying her he would secure a home and the money received from the boarders would be paid to him he might not be accepted still it would do no harm to try mrs waters he said abruptly wreathing his features into what he considered an attractive smile since i lost my wife ive been feeling very lonely i need a wife to look after me and my little gal if you will marry me well live happy and thank you mr martin said mrs waters considerably astonished at the sudden turn affairs had taken but ive got too much to do to think about marrying leastways i dont care about marrying a man that cant pay his boardbill just as you say answered martin philosophically ive give you a good chance perhaps you wont get another very soon well if there isnt impudence for you ejaculated mrs waters as her boarder left the room i must be hard up for a husband to marry such a shiftless fellow as he is the next morning mr martin made his appearance as usual at the breakfasttable notwithstanding his proposal of marriage had been so decidedly rejected the day before his appetite was not only as good as usual but considerably better in fact as he was not quite clear where his dinner was to come from or whether indeed he should have any at all he thought it best to lay in sufficient to last him for several hours mrs waters contemplated with dismay the rapid manner in which he disposed of the beefsteak and hash which constituted the principal dishes of her morning meal and decided that the sooner she got rid of such a boarder the better mr martin observed the eyes of the landlady fixed upon him and misinterpreted it he thought it possible she might have changed her mind as to the refusal of the day before and resolved to renew his proposal accordingly he lingered till the rest of the boarders had left the table mrs waters he said maybe youve changed your mind since yesterday about what demanded the landlady sharply about marrying me no i havent answered the widow you neednt mention the matter again when i want to marry you ill send and let you know all right said martin theres several after me but ill wait a week for you oh dont trouble yourself said the landlady sarcastically i dont want to disappoint anybody else can you pay me this morning ill have the money in a day or two you neednt come back to dinner unless you bring the money to pay your bill i cant afford to give you your board mr martin rose and left the house understanding pretty clearly that he couldnt return on reaching the street he opened his pocketbook and ascertained that twelve cents were all it contained this small amount was not likely to last very long he decided to go to new york having no further inducements to keep him in brooklyn something might turn up he reasoned in the shiftless manner characteristic of him jumping upon a passing car he rode down to fulton ferry and crossed in the boat to the new york side thus expending for travelling expenses eight cents supposing that rufus still sold papers in front of the tribune office he proceeded to printing house square and looked around for him but he was nowhere to be seen who you lookin for govnor inquired a bootblack rather short of stature but with an oldlooking face aint you the boy that went home with me wednesday asked martin to whom ben gibsons face looked familiar sposin i am have you seen a newsboy they call rough and ready this morning yes i seed him where is he has he sold all his papers hes giv up sellin papers and gone into business on wall street dont you try to fool me or ill give you a lickin said martin sternly illustration dont you try to fool me thank you for your kind offer said ben but lickings dont agree with my constitution why dont you tell me the truth then i did you said rufus had gone into business in wall street so he has a rich coves taken a fancy to him and adopted him as a officeboy how much does he pay him asked martin considering whether there would be any chance of getting some money out of his stepson not knowin cant say replied ben but hes just bought two pocketbooks to hold his wages in youre a humbug said martin indignantly whats the mans name he works for its painted in big letters on the sign you cant miss it james martin considered for an instant whether it would be best to give ben a thrashing but the approach of a policeman led him to decide in the negative shine yer boots govnor asked ben professionally yes said martin rather unexpectedly payment in advance said ben who didnt think it prudent to trust in this particular instance ill tell yer what said martin to whom necessity had taught a certain degree of cunning if youll lend me fifty cents for a week ill let you shine my boots every day and pay you the money besides thats a very kind proposal said ben but ive just invested all my money on a countryseat up the river which makes me rather short then you cant lend me the fifty no but ill tell you where you can get it where up in chatham street theres plentyll lend it on the security of that hat of yours the hat in question was in the last stages of dilapidation looking as if it had been run over daily by an omnibus and then used to fill the place of a broken pane being crushed out of all shape and comeliness martin aimed a blow at ben but the bootblack dexterously evaded it and slinging his box over his back darted down nassau street later in the day he met rough and ready i see the govnor this mornin said ben what mr martin yes what did he say he inquired after you in the most affectionate manner and wanted to know where you was at work i hope you didnt tell him not if i know myself i told him hed see the name on the sign then he wanted to borrow fifty cents for a week rufus laughed its a good investment ben ive invested considerable money that way i suppose you gave him the money maybe i did he offered me the chance of blacking his boots every day for a week if id lend him the money but i had to resign the glorious privilege not havin been to the bank this mornin to withdraw my deposits you talk like a banker ben im goin to bankin some day when bootblacking gets dull ben gibson had been for years a bootblack having commenced the business when only eight years old his life had been one of hardship and privation as street life always is but he had become toughened to it and bore it with a certain stoicism never complaining but often joking in a rude way at what would have depressed and discouraged a more sensitive temperament he was by no means a model boy though not as bad as many of his class he had learned to smoke and to swear and did both freely but there was a certain rude honesty about him which led rufus though in every way his superior to regard him with friendly interest and he had on more than one occasion been of considerable service to our hero in his newsboy days rufus had tried to induce him to give up smoking but thus far without success it keeps a feller warm he said besides it wont hurt me im tough chapter iv how james martin came to grief after parting with ben gibson james martin crossed the street to the city hall park and sat down on one of the wooden benches placed there for the public accommodation neither his present circumstances nor his future prospects were very brilliant he was trying to solve the great problem which has troubled so many lazy people of how best to live without work there are plenty of men not only in our cities but in country villages who are at work upon this same problem but few solve it to their satisfaction martin was a good carpenter and might have earned a respectable and comfortable livelihood instead of wandering about the streets in ragged attire without a roof to shelter him or money to pay for a decent meal as he sat on the bench a cigarboy passed him with a box of cigars under his arm cigars he cried four for ten cents come here boy said martin the boy approached i want a cigar i dont sell one four for ten cents martin would willingly have bought four but as his available funds amounted only to four cents this was impossible i dont want but one ive only got four cents in change unless you can change a tendollar bill i cant do that here take three cents and give me a prime cigar ill sell you one for four cents hand over then so martin found himself penniless but the possessor of a cigar which he proceeded to smoke with as much apparent enjoyment as if he had a large balance to his credit at the bank he remained in the park till his cigar was entirely smoked and then sauntered out with no definite object in view it occurred to him however that he might as well call on the keeper of a liquor saloon on baxter street which he had frequently patronized how are you martin asked jim that being the name by which the proprietor was generally known dry as a fish was the suggestive reply then youve come to the right shop whatll you have martin expressed his desire for a glass of whiskey which was poured out and hastily gulped down im out of stamps said martin coolly i spose youll trust me till tomorrow why didnt you say you hadnt any money demanded jim angrily come said martin dont be hard on an old friend ill pay you tomorrow wherell the money come from demanded jim suspiciously this was a question which martin was quite unable to answer satisfactorily to himself ill get it some way he answered youd better or else you neednt come into this shop again martin left the saloon rather disappointed he had had a little idea of asking a small loan from his friend jim but he judged that such an application would hardly be successful under present circumstances jims friendship evidently was not strong enough to justify such a draft upon it martin began to think that it might have been as well on the whole to seek employment at his trade in brooklyn for a time at least until he could have accumulated a few dollars it was rather uncomfortable being entirely without money and that was precisely his present condition even if he had wanted to go back to brooklyn he had not even the two cents needed to pay the boat fare matters had come to a crisis with martin financially and a suspension of specie payments was forced upon him he continued to walk about the streets in that aimless way which results from absence of occupation and found it on the whole rather cheerless work besides he was beginning to get hungry he had eaten a hearty breakfast at his boardinghouse in brooklyn but it was now one oclock and the stomach began to assert its claims once more he had no money still there were places where food at least could be had for nothing he descended into a subterranean apartment over the door of which was a sign bearing the words free lunch as many of my readers know these establishments are to be found in most of our cities a supply of sandwiches or similar food is provided free for the use of those who enter but visitors are expected to call and pay for one or more glasses of liquor which are sold at such prices that the proprietor may on the whole realize a profit it was into one of those places that james martin entered he went up to the counter and was about to help himself to the food supplied after partaking of this he intended to slip out without the drink having no money to pay for it but unfortunately for the success of his plans the keeper at the saloon had been taken in two or three times already that day by similar impostors still had james martin been welldressed he could have helped himself unquestioned to the provisions he desired but his appearance was suspicious his ragged and dirty attire betokened extreme poverty and the man in charge saw at a glance that his patronage was not likely to be desirable look here my friend he said abruptly as martin was about to help himself whatll you take to drink a glass of ale said martin hesitatingly all right pass over the money the fact is said martin i left my pocketbook at home this morning and thats why im obliged to come in here very good then you neednt trouble yourself to take anything we dont care about visitors that leave their pocketbooks at home ill pay you double tomorrow said martin who had no hesitation in making promises he hadnt the least intention of fulfilling that wont go down said the other i dont care about seeing such fellows as you at any time theres the door do you want to fight demanded martin angrily no i dont but i may kick you out if you dont go peaceably we dont want customers of your sort ill smash your head said martin becoming pugnacious here mike run up and see if you cant find a policeman this hint was not lost upon martin he had no great love for the metropolitan police and kept out of their way as much as possible he felt that it would be prudent to evacuate the premises and did so muttering threats meanwhile and not without a lingering glance at the lunch which was not free to him this last failure rather disgusted martin according to his theory the world owed him a living but it seemed as if the world were disposed to repudiate the debt fasting is apt to lead to serious reflection and by this time he was decidedly hungry how to provide himself with a dinner was a subject that required immediate attention he walked about for an hour or two without finding himself at the end of that time any nearer the solution of the question than before to work all day may be hard but to do nothing all day on an empty stomach is still harder about four oclock martin found himself at the junction of wall street and nassau i hardly know what drew this penniless man to the street through which flows daily a mighty tide of wealth but i suspect that he was hoping to meet rufus who as he had learned from ben gibson was employed somewhere on the street rufus might in spite of the manner in which he had treated him prove a truer friend in need than the worthless companions of his hours of dissipation all at once a sharp cry of pain was heard a passing vehicle had run over the leg of a boy who had imprudently tried to cross the street just in front of it the wheels passed over the poor boys legs both of which appeared to be broken of course as is always the case under such circumstances there was a rush to the spot where the casualty took place and a throng of men and boys gathered about the persons who were lifting the boy from the ground the boy seems to be poor said a humane bystander let us raise a little fund for his benefit a humane suggestion like this is pretty sure to be acted upon by those whose hearts are made tender by the sight of suffering so most of those present drew out their pocketbooks and quite a little sum was placed in the hands of the original proposer of the contribution among those who had wedged themselves into the crowd was james martin having nothing to do he had been eager to have his share in the excitement he saw the collection taken up with an envious wish that it was for his own benefit beside him was a banker who from a plethoric pocketbook had drawn a fivedollar bill which he had contributed to the fund closing the pocketbook he carelessly placed it in an outside pocket james martin stood in such a position that the contents of the pocketbook were revealed to him and the demon of cupidity entered his heart how much good this money would do him there were probably several hundred dollars in all perhaps more he saw the banker put the money in his pocket the one nearest to him he might easily take it without observation so he thought in an evil moment he obeyed the impulse which had come to him he plunged his hand into the pocket but at this moment the banker turned and detected him ive caught you you rascal he exclaimed seizing martin with a vigorous grip police martin made a desperate effort to get free but another man seized him on the other side and he was held despite his resistance till a policeman who by a singular chance happened to be near when wanted came up martins ragged coat was rent asunder from the violence of his efforts his hat fell off and he might well have been taken for a desperate character as in this condition he was marched off by the guardian of the citys peace there was another humiliation in store for him he had gone but a few steps when he met rufus who gazed in astonishment at his stepfathers plight martin naturally supposed that rufus would exult in his humiliation but he did him injustice im sorry for him thought our hero compassionately hes done me harm enough but im sorry he learned from one of the crowd for what martin had been arrested and started for franklin street to carry the news to miss manning and rose chapter v the last evening in franklin street though rufus felt sorry for mr martins misfortune there was at least one satisfaction connected with it he would doubtless be sent to blackwells island for three months and of course when there he would be unable to annoy rose or contrive any plots for carrying her off this would be a great relief to rufus who felt more than ever how much the presence of his little sister contributed to his happiness if he was better than the average of the boys employed like himself it was in a considerable measure due to the fact that he had never been adrift in the streets but even in the miserable home afforded by his stepfather had been unconsciously influenced towards good by the presence of his mother and latterly by his little sister rose he in his turn had gained a salutary influence among the street boys who looked up to him as a leader though that leadership was gained in the first place by his physical superiority and manly bearing it occurred to him that perhaps after all it might not be necessary for rose and miss manning to move from franklin street at present on account of mr martins arrest he was rather surprised when on entering the little room after hurrying upstairs two or three steps at a time he saw miss mannings trunk open and half packed with various articles belonging to herself and rose spread out beside it hallo he exclaimed stopping short on the threshold what are you doing getting ready to move rufus answered the seamstress so youve found a place oh such a nice place rufie chimed in little rose theres a nice carpet and theres going to be a sofa and oh its beautiful so youre going to live in style are you said rufus but how about the cost miss manning thats the pleasantest part of it was the reply it isnt going to cost me anything and i am to be paid two dollars a week besides rufus looked bewildered cant i get a chance there too he asked id be willin to give em the pleasure of my society for half a price say a dollar a week besides a room we are to be boarded also said miss manning in a tone of satisfaction if its a conundrum ill give it up said rufus just tell a feller all about it for i begin to think youre crazy or else have come across some benevolent chap thats rather loose in the upper story hereupon miss manning unwilling to keep rufus longer in suspense gave him a full account of her mornings adventures including her engagement with mrs colman youre in luck said rufus and im glad of it but theres one thing well have to settle about whats that about roses board oh that is all settled already mrs colman is to pay for her board as well as mine yes i know that but it is your teachin that is to pay for it yes i suppose so then i must pay you for her board that will make it all right oh no rufus i couldnt accept anything you see it doesnt cost me anything yes it does persisted the newsboy if it wasnt for that you would be paid more money if it wasnt for her i should not have applied for board in that place so you see that it is to rose after all that i am indebted for the situation i see that you are very kind to rose miss manning but i cant have you pay for her board i am her brother and am well and strong i can afford to pay for rose and i will now how much will it be miss manning persisted that she was not willing to receive anything but upon this point the newsboys pride was aroused and finally this arrangement was made miss manning was to receive three dollars a week and for this sum she also agreed to provide rose with proper clothing so that rufus would have no responsibility or care about her he wanted the seamstress to accept four dollars but upon this point she was quite determined she declared that three dollars was too high but finally agreed to accept it i dont want to make money out of rose she said itll take some time to get ahead of a t stewart on three dollars a week i shall have five dollars a week but you will have to buy clothes for rose and yourself i shall make them myself so that they wont cost me more than half of the money then you can save up the rest but you will only have five dollars left to pay your expenses rufus oh i can get along dont mind me but i wanted you to come and board with us mrs clayton has a hall bedroom which she would let to you with board for five dollars a week but that would leave you nothing for clothes i could earn enough some other way to pay for my clothes said rufus but i dont know about going to board with you i expect its a fashionable place and i shouldnt know how to behave you will know how to behave as well as i do i didnt think you were bashful rufus no more i am in the street said the newsboy but you know how ive lived miss manning mr martin didnt live in fashionable style and his friends were not very select when i took breakfast at mr turners i felt like a cat in a strange garret then its time you got used to better society said miss manning you want to rise in the world dont you of course i do then take my advice and come with us youll soon get used to it maybe i will ill come round tomorrow and see how i like it remember you are in business in wall street and ought to live accordingly dont you think mr turner would prefer to have you board in a good place rather than sleep at the lodging house without any home of your own yes i suppose he would said rufus the idea was a new one to him but it was by no means disagreeable he had always been ambitious to rise but thus far circumstances had prevented his gratifying this ambition his stepfathers drunken habits and the consequent necessity he was under of contributing to his support as well as that of rose and his mother when living had discouraged him in all his efforts and led him to feel that all his efforts were unavailing but now his fortunes had materially changed now for the first time there seemed to be a chance for him he felt that it was best to break off as far as possible his old life and turn over a new leaf so the advice of his friend miss manning commended itself to his judgment and he about made up his mind to become a boarder at mrs claytons he would have the satisfaction of being in the same house with his little sister rose and thus of seeing much more of her than if he boarded down town at the lodging house it would cost him more to be sure leaving him as miss manning suggested nothing for his clothes but as his duties in wall street did not commence until nine oclock and terminated at five he felt sure that in his leisure time he would be able to earn enough to meet this expense besides there would be the interest on his five hundred dollars which would amount to not less than thirty dollars and probably more for with the advice of mr turner he was about to purchase with it some bank shares then if it should be absolutely necessary he could break in upon his principal although he would be sorry to do this for though he did not expect to add to it for a year to come he hoped to keep it at its present amount these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind and when little rose taking his hand said pleadingly do come and live with us rufie he answered yes rosy i will if mrs clayton will make room for me oh that will be so nice wont it miss manning said rose clapping her hands perhaps mr martin will come and board with us said rufus jestingly wouldnt you like that rose no said rose looking frightened do you think he will find out where we are not for some time at least said her brother by the way i saw him today miss manning did you speak with him rufus did he try to carry you off rufie asked rose anxiously you forget rose that i am rather too big to carry off said rufus no he did not say anything to me the fact is he has got into a scrape and has enough to do to think of himself tell us about it rufus i saw him just as i was coming home in the hands of the police i heard that he had tried to rob a gentleman of his pocketbook what will they do to him i suppose he will be sent to the island i am sorry for him though he has not treated you and rose right yes i am sorry too but at any rate we need not feel anxious about his getting hold of rose they had a very pleasant supper together it was the last supper in the old room and they determined that it should be a good one rufus went out and got some sirloin steak and brought in a pie from the bakers this with what they had already had made a very nice supper you wont have any more cooking to do for some time miss manning said rufus youll be a lady with servants to wait on you i hope the two little girls wont give you much trouble if they do that might be harder work than sewing they seem to be quite pleasant little girls and they will be a good deal of company for rose how did you like them rosie asked her brother ever so much jennie thats the oldest you know shes almost as big as me said she would give me one of her dolls shes got four thats quite a large family for a young lady to have dont you think she would give me one of them boys dont have dolls said rose decidedly it aint proper rufus laughed then i suppose i must do without one but it would be a great deal of company for me when i go down town to business i could put it in my pocket you know youre only making fun rufie i suppose you think of going up to mrs claytons the first thing in the morning said rufus turning to miss manning yes she answered i can send up my trunk by a city express and rose and i can go up by the horsecars or if it is pleasant we will walk i will go up with you and look at the room you spoke of if you will go early enough for me to be down at the office at nine oclock miss manning assented to this arrangement and rufus left franklin street at nine and repaired to the newsboys lodging house to sleep there for the last time chapter vi a new home at an early hour the next morning miss manning accompanied by rufus and rose ascended mrs claytons steps and rang the bell the summons was answered directly by a servant is mrs clayton at home inquired miss manning yes youre mrs colmans new governess aint you i am but i would like to see mrs clayton first come in and ill call her the three remained standing in the hall awaiting the appearance of the landlady rufus surveyed the interior of the house so far as he could see it with evident approval not that the house compared with the homes of many of my young readers who are favored by fortune it was not magnificent but it was neat and well furnished and looked bright and cheerful to rufus it appeared even elegant he had a glimpse of the parlor through the halfopened door and it certainly was so compared with the humble boardinghouse in franklin street not to mention the miserable old tenement house on leonard street which the readers of rough and ready will easily remember i say miss manning this is jolly said rufus in a tone of satisfaction isnt it a nice house rufie said little rose yes it is rosie and rough and ready to call him for once by his old name felt happy in the thought that his little sister whose life thus far had been passed in a miserable quarter of the city would now be so much more favorably situated at this moment mrs clayton made her appearance goodmorning miss manning she said cordially i am sorry the servant left you standing in the hall goodmorning my dear addressing rose is this young man your brother he is my brother said rose but he isnt a young man hes a boy rufus smiled maybe ill be a young man in twenty or thirty years he said miss manning tells me he continued that you have a small room which you will let for five dollars a week with board yes said the landlady my price has always been five and a half but as your sister would like to have you here i will say five to you can i look at it yes i will go up and show it to you at once they followed mrs clayton up two flights of stairs the door of the vacant room was already open it was a hall bedroom of ordinary size the head of the bed was on the same side as the door the room being just wide enough for it between the foot of the bed and the window but on the opposite side was a bureau with a mirror there were a washstand and a couple of chairs beside it a neat carpet covered the floor and the window was screened by a shade you see it is pretty good size for a hall bedroom said the landlady there is no closet but you can hang your clothes on that row of pegs if there are not enough i will have some more put in i think there will be enough said rufus thinking as he spoke of his limited wardrobe he was not much better off than the man who carried all his clothes on his back and so proclaimed himself independent of trunkmakers well rufus what do you think of the room asked miss manning ill take it said our hero promptly he had been on the point of calling it bully when it occurred to him that perhaps such a word might not be the most appropriate under the circumstances when will you come mr here the landlady hesitated not having been made acquainted with the last name of our new boarder here it occurs to me that as yet our hero has not been introduced by his full name although this is the second volume of his adventures it is quite time that this neglect was remedied rushton said rufus when will you take possession of the room mr rushton ill be here tonight to dinner said rufus maybe i wont send my trunk round till tomorrow i didnt know you had a trunk rufie said rose innocently i dont carry my trunk round all the time like an elephant rosy said her brother a little embarrassed by his sisters revelation for he wanted to keep up appearances in his new character as a boarder at an uptown boardinghouse rufus wouldnt you like to go up and see my room interposed miss manning its on the next floor but though rather high up i think you will like it this opportune interruption prevented rose from making any further reference to the trunk so they proceeded upstairs though mr colman had not yet sent in the additional furniture promised by his wife the room was looking bright and pleasant the carpet had a rich warm tint and everything looked as the saying is as neat as a pin this is to be my room said miss manning with satisfaction my room and rosys i hope you will often come up to visit us how do you like it bully said rufus admiringly unconsciously pronouncing the forbidden word i think we shall be very comfortable here said miss manning here a childs step was heard upon the stairs and jennie colman entered mamma would like to see you downstairs miss manning she said goodmorning my dear said her new governess rufus this is one of my pupils is that your husband miss manning asked jennie surveying rufus with attention rufus laughed and miss manning also he would be rather a young husband for me jennie she said he is more suitable for you i am not old enough to be married yet she answered gravely but perhaps i will marry him some time i like his looks rufus blushed a little not being in the habit of receiving compliments from young ladies have you got that doll for me jennie asked rose introducing the subject which had the greatest interest for her yes ive got it downstairs in mammas room they went down and at the door of mrs colmans room miss manning said wont you come in rufus i will introduce you to mrs colman yes come in said jennie taking his hand but rufus declined feeling bashful about being introduced its time for me to go to the office he said some other time will do youll be here in time for dinner rufus yes said our hero and putting on his hat he made his escape feeling considerably relieved when he was fairly in the open air i spose ill get used to it after a while he said to himself i am glad you have come miss manning said mrs colman extending her hand you will be able to relieve me of a great deal of my care the children are good but full of spirits and when i have one of my nervous headaches the noise goes through my head like a knife i hope you wont find them a great deal of trouble i dont anticipate that said the new governess cheerfully i am fond of children do you ever have the headache very seldom then you are lucky children are a great trial at such a time have you the headache this morning mrs colman asked miss manning in a tone of sympathy not badly but i am seldom wholly free from it now suppose we talk a little of our plans it is time the children were beginning to learn to read can your little girl read a little not very much i suppose it will be better not to require them to study more than an hour or two a day just at first the rest of the time you can look after them i am afraid you will find it quite an undertaking i am not afraid of that said miss manning cheerfully the children have no books to study from perhaps you had better take them out for a walk now and stop on your way at some broadway booksellers and get such books as you think they will need very well are we going out to walk said jennie i shall like that and i too said carrie i hope you wont give miss manning any trouble said their mother here is some money to pay for the books and she handed the new governess a fivedollar bill the children were soon ready and their new governess went on with them she congratulated herself on the change in her mode of life when solely dependent on her labors as a seamstress she had been compelled to sit hour after hour from early morning until evening sewing steadily and then only earned enough to keep soul and body together what wonder if she became thin and her cheek grew pale losing the rosy tint which it wore when as a girl she lived among the hills of new england better times had come to her at length she would probably be expected to spend considerable time daily out of doors as her pupils were too young to study much or long at a time it was a blessed freedom so she felt and she was sure that she should enjoy the society of the two little girls having a natural love for children she did not expect to like them as well as rose for rose seemed partly her own child but she didnt doubt that she should ere long become attached to them then again she would not only enjoy an agreeable home but for the first time would receive such compensation for her services as to be quite at ease in her pecuniary circumstances five dollars a week might not be a large sum to a lady with expensive tastes but miss manning had the art of appearing well dressed for a small sum and as she made her own clothes she estimated that three dollars a week would clothe both and enable her to save two dollars weekly or a hundred dollars a year this was indeed a bright prospect to one who had been engaged in a handtohand struggle with poverty for the last five years she went into a broadway bookstore and purchased primers for her new pupils and a more advanced readingbook for rose at the end of an hour they returned home they found an express wagon at the door two men were lifting out a sofa and a rockingchair they are for your room miss manning said jennie i heard ma tell pa this morning to stop at a furniture place and buy them mr colman had certainly been prompt for though it was still early here they were when they were carried upstairs and placed in her room miss manning looked about her with pardonable pride and satisfaction though the room was on the fourth floor it looked quite like a parlor she felt that she should take great comfort in so neat and pleasant a room it was a great contrast to her dull solitary laborious life in the shabby room for which poor as it was she oftentimes found it difficult to provide the weekly rent there were no lessons that morning for miss manning had her trunk to unpack and roses clothes and her own to lay away in the bureaudrawers she had about completed this work when the bell rang for lunch taking rose by the hand she led her downstairs to the basement where as is common in new york boardinghouses the diningroom was situated there were five ladies and children at the table the gentlemen being obliged on account of the distance to take their lunch down town somewhere near their places of business you may take this seat miss manning said the landlady indicating one near herself your little girl can sit between us and jennie and carrie on the other side i will trouble you to take care of them their mother seldom comes down to lunch the repast was plain but plentiful the principal meal dinner being at six an hour more convenient for men of business i state this for the benefit of those of my readers who live in the country and are accustomed to take dinner in the middle of the day miss manning was introduced to mrs pratt a stout elderly lady with a pleasant face who sat opposite her to mrs florence a young lady recently married who sat at her left and to mrs clifton formerly miss peyton who as well as her husband will be remembered by the readers of the second and third volumes of this series mr clifton kept a dry goods store on eighth avenue in the afternoon miss manning gave her first lesson and succeeded in interesting her young pupils who proved quite docile and seemed to have taken a fancy to their new governess meanwhile rufus had succeeded in making an arrangement which promised to add to his weekly income of this an account will be given in the next chapter chapter vii a new enterprise rufus felt some doubts as to whether he had done wisely in agreeing to board at mrs claytons his own board together with what he paid for his sisters board and clothes would just take up the whole of his salary however he would have the interest on his five hundred dollars now deposited in a savingsbank and yielding six per cent interest annually still this would amount only to thirty dollars and this would not be sufficient to pay for his clothes alone not to mention miscellaneous expenses such as carfares and other incidental expenses he felt that he should like now and then to go on an excursion with his sister and miss manning or perhaps to a place of amusement for all this one hundred dollars a year would be needed at a moderate calculation how should he make up this amount two ways suggested themselves to rufus one was draw upon his principal probably he would not be obliged to do this very long as at the end of six months it was probable that his salary would be raised if he gave satisfaction and this he meant to do still rufus did not like this plan for five hundred dollars seemed a good round sum and he wanted to keep it all the other way was to make up the necessary sum by extra work outside of the office this idea he liked best but it suggested another question which was not altogether easy to answer what should he do or what kind of work should he choose he might go back to his old employment as he was not required to be at the office before nine oclock why should he not spend an hour or two in the early morning in selling newspapers he felt confident that he could in this way clear two dollars a week but there were two objections which occurred to him the first was that as mrs claytons breakfast was at halfpast seven in the winter and not earlier than seven in the summer he would be obliged to give it up and take breakfast at some restaurant down town his breakfasts probably would come to very nearly the sum he would make by selling papers and as mrs clayton took him under her usual price it was hardly to be expected that she would make any allowance for his absence from the morning meal besides rufus had left his old life behind him and he did not want to go back to it he doubted also whether his employer would like to have him spend his time before office hours in selling papers then again he was about to board at a house of very good rank and he felt that he did not wish to pass among his new acquaintances as a newsboy if he could get something better to do of course it was respectable as all honest labor is but our hero felt that by this time he was suited to something better the more rufus balanced these considerations in his mind the more perplexed he became meanwhile he was walking down broadway on his way to the office just as he was crossing canal street some one tapped him on the shoulder turning round he recognized a young man whom he remembered as clerk in a stationery store in nassau street his name was george black rough and ready he exclaimed in surprise is this you why are you not selling papers you got up late this morning didnt you ive given up selling papers said rufus how long since only a few days what are you up to now im in an office in wall street what sort of an office a bankers mr turners yes i know the firm what do you get eight dollars a week thats pretty good better than selling papers yes i like it better though i dont make any more money than i did before but it seems more like business well youve found a place and ive lost one how is that my employer failed and the business has gone up said black i suppose you are looking for a new place yes but i wouldnt if i only had a little capital what would you do then i was walking up sixth avenue yesterday when i saw a neat little periodical and fancy goods store for sale on account of the owners illness its a very good location and being small does not require much capital to carry it on the rent is cheap only twenty dollars a month by adding a few articles i could make a thousand dollars a year out of it why dont you take it because i havent got but a hundred dollars in the world and i expect that will be gone before i get a new place what does the owner want for his stock he says it cost him seven hundred dollars but hes sick and wants to dispose of it as soon as possible hell sell out for five hundred dollars cash are you sure the stock is worth that much asked rufus yes i am sure it is worth more ive been in the business and i can judge why dont you borrow the money it is easy enough to say that but where shall i find anybody to lend it you might take a partner with money so i might if i could find one look here mr black said rufus in a businesslike tone what offer will you make to any one who will furnish you the money to buy out this shop do you know of anybody who has got the money asked the young man perhaps i do and perhaps i dont but maybe i might find somebody ill tell you what ill do if any one will set me up there i will give him a third of the profits after paying expenses and you think that you can make a thousand dollars a year yes i feel sure of it thats a good offer said rufus meditatively im willing to make it at that rate i shall make fourteen dollars a week and i have never been paid but twelve for clerking it besides i should be my own master you might not make so much if i make less i can live on less theres a small room in back where i can put in a bed that will save me roomrent my meals i can buy at the restaurants i dont believe it will cost me over three hundred and fifty dollars to live so that you could save up money yes i should be sure to after a while i could buy out the whole business rufus was silent for a moment he had five hundred dollars why should he not set up george black in business on the terms proposed then instead of getting a paltry thirty dollars interest for his money he would get two or three hundred dollars and this would abundantly make up what he needed to live in good style at mrs claytons and afford rose and himself occasional recreation of course a good deal depended on the honesty of george black but of this young man rufus had a very good opinion having known him for two or three years besides as partner he would be entitled to inquire into the state of the business at any time and if anything was wrong he would take care that it was righted what are you thinking about inquired the young man observing his silence how would you like me for a partner asked rufus looking up suddenly id just as lief have you as anybody if you had the money said george black i have got the money said our hero you dont mean to say youve got five hundred dollars asked black in surprise yes i do how did you get it you didnt make it selling papers in the street you may bet on that no i found part of it and the rest i had given me tell me about it rufus did so where is the money i keep it in a savingsbank ill tell you what rufus said george if youll buy out the shop for me and come in as my partner ill do what i said and thatll be a good deal better than the savingsbank can do for you thats true but therell be more risk i dont think there will i shall manage the business economically and you can come in any time and see how its going on but i never thought you had so much money if you had maybe youd have thought more of me said rufus maybe i should money makes the mare go in this world but when will you let me know about it ive only got two days to decide in i should like to see the shop myself said rufus with commendable prudence of course thats what id like to have you do when will you come round with me and see it i cant come now said our hero for it would make me late at the office is it open in the evening yes then ill tell you what ill meet you there this evening at eight oclock just give me the number and ill be sure to be there all right have you got a pencil yes and heres one of our cards you can put it down here the address was put down and the two parted george black went round to the shop at once to say that he would probably be able to make an arrangement in the evening at the appointed hour the two met at the periodical store rufus was favorably impressed on first entering the room was small but it was very neat it had a good window opening to the street and it appeared well filled with stock a hasty survey satisfied our hero that the stock was really worth more than the amount asked for it the proprietor seemed a sicklylooking man and the plea of illhealth judging from his appearance might readily be credited this is the capitalist i spoke of this morning said george black introducing rufus he seems young said the proprietor a little surprised im not very aged yet said rufus smiling the main thing is that hes got the money said black hes in business in wall street and is looking about for an investment of his spare funds rufus was rather pleased with this way of stating his position he saw that it heightened his importance considerably in the mind of the owner of the shop hell do well to invest here said the latter its a good stand i wouldnt sell out if my health would let me hold on but confinement doesnt suit me the doctor says i shant live a year if i stay here and life is better than money thats so how long has this shop been established asked rufus five years it ought to be pretty well known yes its got a good run of custom if the right man takes hold of it hell make money he cant help it what do you think of it rufus asked george black turning to our hero isnt it as i represented yes said rufus i should think a good business might be done here if i get hold of it a good business shall be done here said black emphatically but it all depends on you say the word and well close the bargain now all right said rufus promptly ill say the word well take the shop chapter viii the new boardinghouse it might be considered hazardous for rufus to invest all his money in a venture which depended to so great an extent upon the honesty of another but there is no profit without risk and our hero felt considerable confidence in the integrity of his proposed partner it occurred to him however that he might need some money before he should receive any from the business accordingly as the young man had told him that he had a hundred dollars he proposed that he should contribute one half of that sum towards the purchase of the shop while he made up the balance four hundred and fifty dollars this would leave him fifty dollars for contingent expenses while george black would have the same our heros streetlife had made him sharp and he determined to secure himself as far as possible he accordingly proposed to george black that they should go to a lawyer and have articles of agreement drawn up for this however he did not have time till the next morning one article proposed by rufus was that he should draw fifty dollars a quarter towards the third share of the profits which it was agreed that he should receive and at the end of the year any balance that might remain due no objection was made by george black who considered this provision a fair one the style of the firm for as most of the capital was furnished by rufus it was thought that his name should be represented was rushton black a new sign was ordered bearing their names and it was arranged that the new proprietors should take possession of the store at the commencement of the next week when it would probably be ready rufus hesitated about announcing his new venture to miss manning and rose but finally concluded not to do so just at present it would be time he thought when they had got fairly started meanwhile he had transferred himself to the room at mrs claytons boardinghouse he felt rather bashful at first about appearing at the table half an hour before the time he reached the house and went up at once to miss mannings room o rufie said rose jumping up from the sofa and running to meet him have you come to stay yes rosie he answered sitting down on the sofa and taking her in his lap i am so glad you are going down to dinner aint you yes i suppose so we have such nice dinners dont we miss manning very nice rose a great deal better than i ever had before i wonder where you will sit rufie he will sit next to you rose i spoke to mrs clayton about it rufus will take care of you and i am to look after jennie and carrie that will be very nice how do you like the little girls rose asked her brother very much they have given me some of their dolls and which knows the most you or they oh i know ever so much more said rose positively is that true miss manning or is rose boasting asked rufus rose is farther advanced than either jennie or carrie answered miss manning they have studied comparatively little yet but i find them docile and i think they will soon improve by the time rufus had combed his hair and put on a clean collar the dinnerbell rang he followed miss manning down into the diningroom goodevening mr rushton said mrs clayton i am glad to see you his name isnt mr rushton said rose his name is rufie it is the first time rose ever heard me called so said rufus smiling she will soon get used to it he was rather pleased than otherwise to be called mr rushton it made him feel more like a man you may take that seat mr rushton said the landlady your little sister will sit beside you rufus took the chair indicated next to him was seated a lady of thirty or more whose hair fell in juvenile ringlets this was mrs clifton formerly miss peyton who will be remembered by the readers of fame and fortune rufus was introduced to her i am very glad to make your acquaintance mr rushton said mrs clifton graciously you have a very sweet little sister yes she is a very good little girl said rufus better pleased with a compliment to rose than he would have been with one to himself i understand you are in business in wall street mr rushton yes said rufus i am in the office of mr turner i sometimes tell mr clifton i wish he would go into business in wall street he keeps a drygoods store on eighth avenue cant remember ever hearing you mention the idea mrs c remarked her husband who sat on the other side in a pause between two mouthfuls there aint much money in dry goods just now by jove ill open in wall street if you say the word mrs clifton slightly frowned and did not see fit to answer the remark made to her her husband was not very brilliant either in business wit or in any other way and she had married him not from love but because she saw no other way of escaping from being an old maid do you know mr rushton said mrs clifton you remind me so much of a very intimate friend of mine mr hunter do i added rufus i hope he is goodlooking hes very handsome said mrs clifton and so witty then im glad im like him said rufus for some reason he did not feel so bashful as he anticipated particularly with mrs clifton hes soon going to be married to a very rich young lady miss greyson perhaps you know her thats where he has the advantage of me said rufus mr clifton said his wife dont you think mr rushton looks very much like mr hunter yes said her husband as much as i look like the emperor napoleon dont make a goose of yourself mr clifton said his wife sharply thank you i dont intend to a goose is a female and i dont care to make such a change i suppose you think that is witty said mrs clifton a little disdainfully it is unnecessary to pursue the conversation those who remember mrs clifton when she was miss peyton will easily understand what was its character it had the effect however of putting rufus at his ease on the whole considering that he was only used to cheap restaurants he acquitted himself very well for the first time and no one suspected that he had not always been accustomed to live as well the dinner he found excellent mrs clayton herself superintended the preparation of dinner and she was not inclined to undue economy as is the case with many landladies im glad i came here thought rufus its worth the difference in price as they rose from the table mrs colman asked miss manning is that the brother of your little girl yes answered miss manning he has a very good appearance i should like to have you bring him into our room a while miss manning communicated this invitation to rufus he would have excused himself gladly but he felt that this would have been hardly polite therefore he accepted it i am glad to make your acquaintance mr rushton said mrs colman thank you said rufus i hear that you have come to board with us yes he answered wishing that he might think of something more to say but not succeeding it is a pleasant boardingplace i hope you will like it i think i shall you have a very nice little sister my little girls like her very much she will be a great deal of company for them i think she is a very good little girl said rufus but then i am her brother so i suppose it is natural for me to think so you are in an office in wall street i am told said mr colman yes sir said rufus whose may i ask mr turners he is an able businessman and stands high you could not learn business under better auspices i like him very much said rufus but then i have not been long in his office i find miss manning relieves me of a great deal of care and trouble said mrs colman her new governess being just then out of the room i feel that i was fortunate in securing her services i think you will like her said rufus she is very kind to rose i dont know what i should do with little sister if i did not have her to look after her then your mother is not living mr rushton no said rufus she has been dead for two years and you are the sole guardian of your little sister yes maam after half an hours call which rufus found less embarrassing and more agreeable than he anticipated he excused himself and went upstairs on tuesday of the nest week he decided to reveal his new plans to miss manning accordingly he managed to reach home about halfpast four in the afternoon and invited her and rose to take a walk with him where shall we walk she asked over to sixth avenue said rufus i want to show you a store there miss manning soon got ready and the three set out it was not far scarcely ten minutes walk when they arrived opposite the store rufus pointed over to it do you see that periodical store he asked yes said miss manning how do you like it why do you ask she inquired puzzled look at the sign he answered rushton black read miss manning why that is your name and i am at the head of the firm said rufus complacently what does it all mean asked miss manning how can it be ill tell you said rufus a few words made her understand now said rufus let us go over to my store and look in what is it your store rufie asked rose yes little sister its part mine when they entered they found george black behind the counter waiting on a customer who directly went out well george hows business asked rufus it opens well said his partner cheerfully its a good stand and theres a good run of custom this is my friend miss manning said rufus and my little sister rose i am glad to see you miss manning said the young man i hope he added smiling you will give us a share of your patronage well buy all our slatepencils at rufies store wont we miss manning said rose yes i think so answered miss manning with a smile then said rufus we shall be certain to succeed if theres a large profit on slatepencils george yes if you charge high enough after a little more conversation they left the store what do you think of my store miss manning asked rufus its a very neat one i had no idea you had become so extensive a businessman rufus is rufie an extensive man asked rose i hope to be some day said rufus smiling chapter ix at the end of three months rufus soon became accustomed to his new boardinghouse and came to like it it gratified his pride to perceive that he was regarded as an equal by his fellowboarders and that his little sister rose was a general favorite it seemed almost a dream and a very disagreeable one the life they had formerly lived in the miserable tenementhouse in leonard street but still the remembrance of that time heightened his enjoyment of his present comforts and even luxuries he usually spent the evening in miss mannings room and feeling the deficiencies in his education commenced a course of study and reading he subscribed to the mercantile library and thus obtained all the books he wanted at a very moderate rate by way of showing how they lived at this time i will introduce the reader to miss mannings room one evening about three months after rufus had begun to board in the house miss manning was seated at the table sewing her young pupils were gone to bed and she had the evening to herself rufus was reading abbotts life of napoleon which he found very interesting little rose had fallen asleep on the sofa what are you sewing upon miss manning asked rufus looking up from his book i am making a dress for rose when you get tired just let me know and i will sew a little for you thank you rufus said miss manning smiling but i suppose it wont hurt your feelings much if i doubt your abilities as a seamstress i am afraid i shouldnt make a very good living at that miss manning times have changed a little since you used to sew from morning till night yes they have i used to see some hard times rufus but everything has changed since i got acquainted with you and little rose i sometimes am tempted to regard you as my good angel thank you i dont know much about angels but im afraid i dont look much like one they never have red cheeks and do business in wall street do they from what i have heard i dont believe wall street is a favorite resort with them but seriously everything seems to have prospered since i met you really i am beginning to be a capitalist how much money do you think i have saved up out of the three dollars a week which you pay me youve bought some things for yourself and rose havent you yes we have each had a dress and some little things then i dont see how you could save up much i made the dresses myself and that was a great saving let me see youve paid me fortytwo dollars in all for fourteen weeks i will see how much i have left she went to the bureau and took out her pocketbook i have twentyfive dollars she said counting the contents am i not growing rich perhaps youd like to speculate with it in wall street suggested rufus i think id better keep the money or put it in a savingsbank when you have money enough i can buy you a fiftydollar government bond i shall have to wait a while first well as for me said rufus i cant tell exactly how i do stand i took fifty dollars out of that five hundred i had in the savingsbank i think ive got about half of it left the rest of it went for a trunk car fare and other expenses so you see ive been going down hill while youve been climbing up have you drawn anything from your store yet rufus you were to draw fifty dollars a quarter i believe yes and that reminds me that george black promised to call this evening and pay the money its about time to expect him rufus had hardly spoken when a servant knocked at the door rufus opened it theres a young man downstairs that would like to see you mr rushton she said where is he nancy in the parlor ill go right down i think it must be black he said turning to miss manning if it is of course you will bring him up yes i should like to we cant talk very well in such a public place rufus went down and shortly reappeared with george black goodevening mr black said miss manning take a seat i hope you are well im thriving said black how pleasant and cheerful you look yes the room is rather high up but it is pleasant when you get to it we were just speaking of you when the girl came to let us know that you were here i hope you said nothing very bad about me not very i think i shall be welcome as i have brought you some money money is always welcome here said rufus ill take care of all you can bring i have brought fifty dollars according to our agreement can you spare that amount without affecting the business oh yes i suppose you cant tell me what the profits have been for the last three months not exactly but i have made a rough calculation as it was the first quarter i knew you would like to know well what is your estimate as well as i can judge we have cleared about two hundred and fifty dollars that is at the rate of a thousand dollars a year yes isnt that doing well capitally do you think the business will hold out at that rate i feel sure of it i hope to improve upon it even if you dont that will give you nearly seven hundred dollars a year and me over three hundred thats better than clerking for me i mean perhaps you might get more as a clerk perhaps i might but now i am my own master and then i shouldnt be besides i have plans in view which i think will increase our custom and of course our profits also success to the firm of rushton black said miss manning smiling thank you said rufus i like that sentiment and id drink to it if i saw anything to drink have you got any champagne in the closet miss manning all that i ever had there rufus if a glass of water will do as well i can give you that at this moment a knock was heard at the door miss manning rose and opened it the visitor proved to be mrs clifton of whom mention has already been made goodevening mrs clifton said the governess come in thank you but i didnt know you had company dont stand on ceremony mrs clifton said rufus my friend mr black is perfectly harmless i assure you he is neither a bull nor a bear what spirits you have mr rushton no spirits at all mrs clifton miss manning has just been offering us some water as a substitute you are so lively mr rushton you remind me so much of my friend mr hunter i suppose he was one of your admirers before you became mrs clifton really mr rushton you mustnt say such things mr hunter and i were very intimate friends but nothing more i assure you is mr clifton well asked miss manning he hasnt got home from the store you know the dry goods stores always keep open late really i might as well have no husband at all it is so late when mr clifton gets home and then he is so sleepy that he cant keep his eyes open it was generally believed that mr and mrs clifton did not live together as happily as they might have done a fact that will not at all surprise those who are familiar with their history before their marriage which was quite a business arrangement mrs clifton married because she did not want to be an old maid and mr clifton because he knew his prospective wife had money by means of which he could establish himself in business are you in business in wall street mr black inquired mrs clifton no i keep a store on sixth avenue indeed my husband keeps a dry goods store on eighth avenue mine is a periodical and fancy goods store mr rushton here is my partner indeed mr rushton i am surprised to hear that you have not left wall street have you no i have only invested a portion of my extensive capital my friend black carries on the business thus far rufus had said nothing in the house about his connection with the sixth avenue store but now that it was no longer an experiment he felt that there was no objection to doing so mrs clifton who liked to retail news took care to make it known in the house and the impression became general that rufus was a young man of property mr pratt who was an elderly man rather given to prosy dissertations upon public affairs got into the habit of asking our heros opinion upon the financial policy of the government to which when expressed he used to listen with his head a little on one side as though the words were those of an oracle this embarrassed rufus a little at first but as during the day he was in a situation to hear considerable in reference to this subject he was generally able to answer in a way that was regarded as satisfactory that young man remarked mr pratt to his wife in private has got a head upon his shoulders he knows whats what depend upon it if he lives long enough he will become a prominent man i cant judge of that said goodnatured mrs pratt but hes a very agreeable young man i am sure and his sister is a little darling chapter x mr martin again appears on the scene the success of the periodical store put rufus into good spirits he saw that it would yield him if only the present degree of prosperity continued at least three hundred dollars a year which would make quite a handsome addition to his income he felt justified in going to a little extra expense and determined to celebrate his good luck by taking martha and rose to a place of amusement it happened that at this time a company of japanese jugglers were performing at the academy of music which as my new york readers know is situated on fourteenth street meaning it to be a surprise he said nothing to rose or martha but before going down town the next day went to the boxoffice and secured three reserved seats in an excellent situation they were expensive but rufus was resolved that he would not spare expense for this occasion at least when he reached home at halfpast five in the afternoon he went up at once to marthas room miss manning he said have you any engagement this evening it is hardly necessary to ask rufus she replied my company is not in very great demand you have heard of the japanese jugglers at the academy of music yes mrs florence was speaking of them this morning she and her husband went last evening and we are going this evening wouldnt you like to go rosy ever so much rufie will you take me yes i have got tickets see here and rufus drew out the three tickets which he had purchased in the morning thank you rufus said miss manning i shall like very much to go it is long since i went to any place of amusement how much did the tickets cost a dollar and a half apiece isnt that rather extravagant it would be if we went every week but now and then we can afford it you must let me pay for my ticket rufus not if i know it said rufus its a pity if a wall street banker cant carry a lady to a place of amusement without charging her for the ticket if you put it that way i suppose i must yield said miss manning smiling rose was highly excited at the idea of going to see the japanese whose feats as described by mrs florence at the breakfasttable had interested her exceedingly the prospect of sitting up till eleven in the evening also had its charm and she was quite too excited to eat much dinner really said mrs clifton i quite envy you miss manning i tried to get mr clifton to buy tickets but he hasnt done it first time i heard of it said her husband you pay very little attention to what i ask i am aware of that said mrs clifton in an aggrieved tone well go now if you say so we couldnt get any decent seats when did you buy yours mr rushton this morning mrs clifton who was thoroughly selfish hinted that probably rose wouldnt care about going and that she should be glad to buy the ticket and accompany rufus and miss manning but this hint failed to be taken and she was forced unwillingly to stay at home to tell the truth miss manning was scarcely less pleased than rose at the idea of going until recently she had been a poor seamstress earning scarcely enough to subsist upon much less to pay for amusements sometimes in the early evening she had passed the portals of places of amusement and wished that she were able to break the tedious monotony of her daily life by entering but it was quite out of the question and with a sigh she would pass on now she was very differently situated and her life was much pleasanter can i wear my new dress martha asked rose yes rosy it was fortunate that i got it finished today and will you wear yours too martha yes i think so she said rufus has bought us nice seats and we must look as well as we can when both were dressed they surveyed themselves with satisfaction miss manning was not above the weakness if it is a weakness of liking to appear well dressed though she was not as demonstrative as rose who danced about the room in high enjoyment when they were quite ready rufus came into the room he had a pair of kid gloves in his hand which he twirled about in rather an embarrassed way i cant get the confounded things on miss manning he said ive been trying for some time but its no go the fact is i never owned a pair of kid gloves before id enough sight rather go without any but i suppose if i am going to sit in a fashionable seat i must try to look fashionable miss manning soon explained to rufus how the gloves should go on this time the success was better and he was soon neatly gloved they are pretty gloves rufus she said i dont like the feeling of them said rufus they feel strange that is because you are not used to them youll like them better soon i wonder what some of my old street friends would say to see me now said rufus smiling theyd think i was a tiptop swell though the gloves did not feel comfortable rufus looked at his hands with satisfaction step by step he was getting into the ways of civilized life and he was very anxious to leave as far behind him as possible his street experiences soon after dinner they left the house and proceeding to broadway walked up as far as union square then they turned down fourteenth street and a few minutes brought them to the academy of music the entrance and vestibule were brilliantly lighted on the steps and in front were a number of speculators who were eagerly offering their tickets to those who appeared unprovided rufus pushed his way through with martha and rose at his side his tickets were taken at the gate but the portion indicating the number of their reserved seats was torn off and given back to them on showing them to the usher they were conducted to their seats which were in the sixth row from the stage and fronting it well have a good view here miss manning he said soon the curtain rose and the performance commenced to those who have not seen the japanese in their peculiar performance it is enough to say that they show marvellous skill and agility in their feats some of which are so difficult as to seem almost impossible all three enjoyed the performance miss manning though so much older was almost as much unaccustomed as little rose herself to such scenes and took a fresh interest in it which those who go often cannot feel every now and then little rose unable to restrain her enthusiasm exhibited her delight openly i should like for the benefit of my younger readers to give a detailed account of some portions of the performance which seemed most wonderful but my memory is at fault and i can only speak in general terms it was a little after ten when the curtain finally fell is that all asked rose half in disappointment thats all rosy are you sleepy not a bit said rose vivaciously i should like to stay here an hour longer wasnt it perfectly beautiful rufie yes it was very good said rufus i dont know but i like it almost as well as the old bowery though he had risen in the social scale he had not quite lost his relish for the style of plays for which the old bowery the favorite theatre with the street boys is celebrated but that he had a suspicion that it was not exactly a fashionable place of amusement he would like to have taken rose and miss manning there this evening he would hardly have liked to mention it at the table afterwards however the audience rose from their seats and rufus with them slowly they moved towards the door and at last made their way to the entrance had rufus known who was waiting there he might have felt a little nervous but he did not know and it devolves upon us to explain three days before mr martin who had been sentenced to the penitentiary for three months on account of his attempt at picking pockets which we have already chronicled was released to say the least he left the prison no better than he had entered it better in one sense he was for he had been forced for three months to abstain from drink and this he felt to be a great hardship but it had a favorable influence upon his health and his skin was clearer and his nose not quite so ruddy as when he was arrested but so far as good intentions went he had not formed any during his exile from society and now that he was released he was just as averse to living by honest industry as before however his resources were still limited money had never been very plentiful with him and just at present he was not encumbered with any it did not occur to him that the shortest way to obtain some was to go to work or if it did the suggestion did not strike him favorably it did occur to him however that there were charitable persons in the metropolis who might be induced to help him and he resolved to act upon this suggestion accordingly he haunted the neighborhood of the academy of music until the stream of people began to pour out from it and then he felt that the time had come for him to carry out his plans he went up to a gentleman who was coming out with a young lady leaning on his arm will you listen to me a minute sir he said in a whining tone i havent eaten anything since yesterday and i have no money to pay for a nights lodging why dont you go to work said the gentleman i cant get anything to do sir ive been trying for something all day the fact was that mr martin had been lounging about a low barroom all day here take this and clear the way the gentleman more to get rid of him than anything else dropped five cents into his hand and passed on he might have given a quarter grumbled martin it wouldnt have hurt him he looked up intending to make a similar application to the next person when he uttered an exclamation of surprise and exultation close before him he saw rufus and his little sister accompanied by miss manning chapter xi mr martins wildgoose chase probably nothing could have given martin greater pleasure than this unexpected meeting with his stepchildren he did not reflect that the pleasure might not be mutual but determined to make himself known without delay hurrying forward he placed one hand on the shoulder of rufus saying glad to see you rufus what have you been up to lately heres rose too i expect shes glad to see me at the first sound of his voice poor rose began to tremble clinging closer to her brother she said dont let him take me rufie he shant touch you rose said rufus manfully you dont seem very glad to see me said martin smiling maliciously thats where youre right said rufus bluntly we are not glad to see you i suppose that dont surprise you much come along rose he tried to leave martin but martin did not choose to be left he shuffled along by the side of our hero considerably to the disgust of the latter who was afraid he might fall in with some acquaintance whose attention would be drawn to the not very respectablelooking object who had accosted him and learn the relationship that existed between them you seem to be in a hurry sneered martin i am in a hurry said rufus its late for rose to be out thats what i was thinking said martin considerin that im her natural protector its my duty to interfere a pretty sort of protector you are retorted rufus scornfully youre an undootiful boy said martin to speak so to your father who do you mean aint i your father no you are not if you were id be ashamed of you mr martin we havent anything to do with each other you can go your way and ill go mine i shant interfere with you and i shant allow you to interfere with me ho ho said martin when was you twentyone id like to know it doesnt make any difference when goodnight you dont get rid of me so easy said martin ill follow you home by this time they had reached the corner of broadway and union square rufus was placed in an awkward position he had no authority to order martin away he might follow them home and ascertain where they lived and probably would do so rufus felt that this would never do were their home known to mr martin he would have it in his power to lie in wait for rose and kidnap her as he had done once before he would never feel easy about his little sister under these circumstances yet what could he do if he should quicken his pace martin would do the same what do you want to follow us for he asked what good is it going to do you dont you trouble yourself about that said martin exulting in our heros evident perplexity considerin that you two are my children i may want to come and see you some time here rose began to cry she had always been very much afraid of martin and feared now that she might fall into his hands dont cry rose said rufus soothingly he shant do you any harm maybe he wont if you treat him well said martin look here rufus im hard up dead broke havent you a dollar to spare are you going to follow us maybe i wont if youll give me the dollar i cant trust you said rufus suspiciously ill tell you what he added after a little thought go up to madison park and sit down on one of the seats and ill come up in half an hour or three quarters at most and give you the dollar do you think im so green sneered martin i might stop there all night without seein you all you want is a chance to get away without my knowin where no said rufus ill do what i promise but you must go up there now and not follow us that dont go down said martin you dont ketch a weasel asleep well said rufus coolly you can do just as you please if you accept my offer you shall have a dollar inside of an hour if you dont you wont get a penny still martin was not persuaded he felt sure that rufus meant to mislead him and being unreliable himself he put no confidence in the promise made by our hero he prepared to follow him home as the knowledge of where rose lived would probably enable him to extort more than a dollar from the fear and anxiety of rufus so he repeated that dont go down you aint quite smart enough to take me in im goin to follow you and find out where you live better give him the dollar now rufus suggested miss manning who felt nearly as anxious as rose no said rufus decidedly i shant gain anything by it as soon as he got the money hed follow us all the same what will you do asked miss manning anxiously youll see said rufus composedly he had been busily thinking and a plan had suggested itself to his mind which he thought offered probably the best way out of the difficulty he reflected that probably mr martin judging from his appearance was penniless or nearly so he therefore decided to jump on board a horsecar and thus elude him when they reached the corner of university place a car was seen approaching rufus hailed it are we going to ride asked rose yes rose and now whatever i do i want you to keep perfectly still and say nothing will you promise yes rufie rufus exacted this promise as rose might unconsciously by some unguarded exclamation betray the very knowledge which he was anxious to conceal martin fathomed the purpose of our hero and determined not be balked he had five cents which had just been given him out of charity at the door of the academy and though the fare on the horsecars was one cent more he thought he might make it do accordingly he got into the car after rufus i couldnt bear to leave such agreeable company he said with a leer horsecars are free i believe i believe they are said rufus i wonder how much money hes got thought our hero i guess i can drain him after a while the conductor came along and rufus paid for miss manning and rose as well as himself martin was hanging on a strap near by your fare said the conductor martin plunged his hand into his pocket and drew out five cents he plunged his hand in again and appeared to be hunting about for the extra penny i declare said he i believe ive lost the other cent wont five cents do couldnt let you ride under six cents said the conductor its against the rules i cant see where it is said martin hunting again ill pay the other penny said a gentleman sitting near thank you sir said martin very much obliged to you im a poor man but its on account of some undutiful children that ive spent all my money on and now they begrudge their poor father a few pennies he looked at rufus but our hero did not see fit to apply the remark to himself nor considering that he used to help support martin did he feel any particular remorse if martin had been a more respectablelooking object if his nose had been a trifle less red and his whole appearance less suggestive of intemperate habits the remark he had let fall might have stirred some of his listeners to compassion but no one to look at him would wonder much at a want of filial affection towards such a father so though he looked round to notice the effect hoping that he might elicit some sympathy which should take a pecuniary form he perceived that his appeal had fallen upon stony ground nobody seemed particularly impressed and the hope of a contribution from some compassionate listener faded out rufus was a witness of this scene and of course it enabled him to fathom martins resources he congratulated himself that they were so speedily exhausted he did not get out when the car reached waverley place for obvious reasons but kept on till they came to bleecker street rose was about to express surprise but a look from rufus checked her at bleecker street he signalled to the conductor to stop the latter obeyed the signal and our hero got out followed not only by rose and miss manning but as might have been expected also by martin you dont get rid of me so easy said the latter triumphantly dont i asked rufus coolly are you going to follow me still martin answered in the affirmative with an oath then said rufus coolly ill give you all the following you want to do a car bound in the opposite direction was approaching rufus hailed it and it came to a stop martin who had not been anticipating this move stopped a moment staring crestfallen at rufus but recovering himself quickly jumped on the platform resolved to try his luck rufus paid his fare martin didnt volunteer to pay his but looked steadily before him hoping that he might escape the conductors observation but the latter was too sharp for that fare he said all right said martin plunging his hand into his pocket of course he drew out nothing as he anticipated i declare he said i believe i havent any money with me then get off couldnt you let me off this time asked martin insinuatingly im a poor man so am i said the conductor bluntly you must get off isnt there any gentleman thatll lend a poor man six cents asked martin looking round but nobody seemed disposed to volunteer assistance and martin was compelled reluctantly to jump off but he didnt give up yet the car didnt go so fast but that he could keep up with it by running it chafed him that rufus should get the better of him and he ran along on the sidewalk keeping the car continually in sight hes running said miss manning looking out what a determined man he is im afraid hell find us out im not afraid said rufus hell get tired of running by the time we get to central park shall you ride as far as that if necessary for about a mile martin held out but by this time he became exhausted and dropped behind the distance between him and the car gradually increased but still rufus rode on for half a mile further by this time martin was no longer in sight well cross over to sixth avenue he said so that martin may not see us on our return this suggestion was adopted luckily for martin had posted himself at a favorable place and was scanning attentively every returning car but he waited and watched in vain till long after the objects of his pursuit were safe at home and in bed chapter xii martins luck turns martin continued to watch for an hour or two sitting in a doorway at length he was forced to conclude that rufus had given him the slip and this tended by no means to sweeten his temper in fact his position was not altogether a pleasant one it was now past midnight and having no money he saw no other way than to spend the night in the street besides he was hungry and that was a complaint which was likely to get worse instead of better as for rufus martin had never before seen him so well dressed and it seemed clear that he was prospering hes an ungrateful young rascal muttered martin livin in ease and comfort while i am left to starve in the street it would have been rather hard to tell what rufus had to be grateful for unless for the privilege which he had enjoyed for some time of helping support his stepfather but martin persuaded himself that he was ungrateful and undutiful and grew indignant over his fancied wrongs as he lay back in discomfort on the stone step which he had selected as his restingplace the night passed slowly away and when the morning light came martin got up very stiff and sore and more hungry than ever and began to wonder where he was likely to get any breakfast begging seemed to him on the whole the easiest way of getting along but it was too early for that after a while however the street began to be peopled and he walked up to a gentleman who was approaching and assuming a look which he thought indicative of wretchedness whined out would you be willing to help a poor man sir the gentleman stopped so you are poor he said yes said martin i have been very unfortunate why dont you work i cant find any work to do answered martin havent you got any friends to help you theyve all turned against me said martin even my own children have turned me out of the house to shift for myself how old are your children asked the other martin hesitated for this question was a little embarrassing one of them is sixteen he said a son yes did you support him or did he support you was the natural inquiry i supported him said martin but hes an undootiful ungrateful scamp and then it appears that he has relieved you from taking care of him and you have only yourself to provide for it appears to me that you ought to get along better than before if i could get any work what sort of work do you want to do if i had a few dollars i could set up in some light business you will have to apply elsewhere for the money my friend said the gentleman to be frank with you your appearance doesnt speak in your favor and he walked on thats the way the rich and prosperous treat the poor soliloquized martin feeling that the whole world was in a conspiracy against him those who undertake to live without work are very apt to arrive at such conclusions martin concluded on the whole that he wouldnt refer to being turned out of his house next time as it might lead to embarrassing questions he approached another gentleman and began with the same appeal for assistance whats the matter cant you work was the reply ive had a severe fit of sickness said martin forcing a cough and im very feeble i haint had anything to eat for twentyfour hours and ive got a wife and five little children dependent on me if that dont bring something thought martin nothing will where do you live no twentyfourth street answered martin glibly now the individual addressed was a gentleman of leisure of a philanthropic turn of mind and one who frequently visited the poor at their homes martins story seemed pitiful and he concluded to inquire into it im sorry for you he said ill go round with you and see your family and see what can be done for them this was just what martin did not want as the family he spoke of was entirely imaginary it would only result in exposure and disappointment yet he knew not how to refuse im much obliged to you sir he said im afraid it would be too much trouble no ive nothing pressing for an hour i always like to relieve the unfortunate what shall i do thought martin as he walked by the side of the benevolent stranger at length an idea struck him it isnt everybody that would be willing to risk going with me he said why not theyd be afraid to come why what danger is there my third child is most dead with the smallpox answered martin with a very dejected look good heavens and i might have carried the infection home to my children exclaimed the stranger in excitement then you wont go with me asked martin here said the gentleman producing fifty cents heres a little money take it and i hope itll do you good i reckon it will thought martin as he took the money itll buy me some breakfast and a couple of cigars thats a pretty good idea havin a child sick with the smallpox ill know what to do next time anybody wants to go home with me as soon as martin found himself in funds he took measures to satisfy his appetite he really had not eaten anything since the middle of the day previous and felt that he could do justice to a substantial breakfast he walked along until he came to a restaurant where the prices seemed to be reasonable and went in seating himself at one of the tables he gave his order and presently a plate of meat and cup of coffee were placed before him to these he devoted himself with such vigor that they were soon despatched still martins appetite was not satisfied much as he wanted a cigar the claims of hunger were imperative and he ordered breakfast to the extent of his resources opposite him at the table sat a man of middle age with bushy whiskers and a scar on his left cheek he wore a loose sack coat and a velvet vest his thick bunchy fingers displayed two large showy rings set with stones probably imitation he finished his breakfast before martin but still retained his seat and watched him rather attentively martin was too busily engaged to notice the scrutiny to which he was subjected after sitting a while the stranger drew out a cigar and lighting it began to smoke this drew martins attention as the flavor of the cigar which was a very good one reached his nostrils he began to feel a regret that he had not reserved a part of his funds for the purchase of a cigar his opposite neighbor observed his look and for a reason which will appear saw fit to gratify martins desire i dont like to smoke alone he said drawing another cigar from his pocket wont you have a cigar thank you said martin eagerly accepting it youre very kind dont mention it so you like to smoke light it by mine yes said martin i like smoking but im a poor man and i cant afford to smoke as often as i want to been unfortunate said the stranger suggestively yes said martin lucks been aginst me i couldnt get work to do and my family turned aginst me because i was poor ive got two children living on the fat of the land but one of em refused me a dollar last night and left me to sleep in the streets thats bad said the other hes an undootiful son said martin better luck by and by said the stranger luckll turn its likely i wish it would turn pretty quick said martin ive spent my last cent for breakfast and i dont know where im to get my dinner the world owes every man a living remarked the stranger sententiously so it does said martin i dont see whats the use of bein born at all if youre goin to starve afterwards very true now ill tell you what my principle is what is it asked martin who was becoming interested in his companion if the world owes me a living and isnt disposed to pay up promptly i think its perfectly right for me to collect the debt any way i can so do i said martin though he didnt exactly see the others drift for instance if i was starving and my next neighbor was a baker and had plenty of bread the law of selfpreservation justifies me in taking a loaf without payin for it yes if i havent got any money to pay im entitled to my share of food and if others keep it from me i have a right to help myself havent i thats so said martin only its dangerous of course there is a risk about it but then theres a risk in starvin isnt there i should think there was said martin i thought we should agree pretty well now tell me what you propose to do perhaps i can assist you i dont know what to do said martin i cant get work what do you do im in business said the stranger evasively couldnt you give me a chance that is if it aint hard work i aint so strong as i was once and i aint fit for hard work well perhaps i may be able to do something for you said the stranger if youll walk with me a little way well smoke another cigar and talk it over what do you say of course martin accepted the proposal with alacrity he did not want to go back to his work as a carpenter having lost all relish for honest industry he would rather beg or do anything else for a living he had a very indefinite idea of the nature of the proposal which was coming but whatever it might be he was not likely to be shocked at it here give me your check said the stranger he paid therefore for martins breakfast as well as his own leaving that gentlemans fifty cents intact martin was not used to such attention and appreciated it for the first time he began to think that his luck had really turned the two went out into the street together and were soon engaged in earnest conversation chapter xiii martin makes a business engagement martin was agreeably surprised at the attention paid him by his new friend there are some who have no difficulty in making friends at first sight but this had not often happened to him in fact there was very little that was attractive or prepossessing about him and though he could not be expected to be fully aware of that he had given up expecting much on the score of friendship yet here was a stranger who to martins undiscriminating eyes appeared quite the gentleman who had given him a cigar paid his dinnerbill and treated him with a degree of attention to which he was unaccustomed martin felt that he was in luck and if there was anything to be made out of his new friend he was determined to make it they turned down a side street perhaps because the strangers course led that way perhaps because he was not proud of his new acquaintance so youve had poor luck he remarked by way of starting the conversation yes grumbled martin you may say that things have all been aginst me its a pretty hard rub for a poor man to get a livin here just so said the other whats your business im a carpenter and you cant find work no said martin besides he added after a pause my health aint very good hard work dont agree with me he might have said that hard drinking did not agree with him and this would have been rather nearer the truth but he was afraid his new friend would offer to find him employment as a carpenter and for this he was not very anxious there had been a time when he was content to work early and late for good wages but he had of late years led such a shiftless and vagabond life that honest industry had no more attraction for him and he preferred to get his living by hook or crook in fact in any way he could rather than take the most direct path to a good living by working hard for it what is your name james martin whats yours mine said the stranger pausing and fixing his eyes thoughtfully upon martin well you may call me smith that aint a very uncommon name said martin thinking he had perpetrated a good joke just so said the stranger composedly ive been told so often well mr smith do you think you could help me to some light business that wouldnt be too hard on my health perhaps i might said the other what do you think you would like why said martin if i only had a little capital i could set up a small cigar store or maybe a drinkin saloon that would be light and genteel no doubt said smith but confining youd have to be in the store early and late i might have a boy to stay there when i wanted to go out suggested martin so you might said the other there doesnt seem any objection if you can only raise the capital this was rather a powerful objection however especially as mr smith offered no encouragement about supplying the capital himself martin saw this and he added i only mentioned this i aint any objection to anything else thats light and easy do you think of anything i could do i may be able to throw something in your way said mr smith but first i must ask you a question can you keep a secret yes said martin just as many as you like because the business which i have to propose is of rather a confidential character and a great deal depends on its being kept secret all right im your man then when i saw you in the restaurant said smith it struck me that you might answer our purpose you look as if you could be trusted so i can be said martin pleased with the compliment ill never say a word about the matter what is it you shall learn presently that is if my partner thinks we had better engage you where is your place of business we will go there let us jump into this horsecar they had reached eighth avenue and entered a car bound downwards when the conductor came along smith said i pay for two indicating martin this was fortunate for martins purse was at a low ebb his entire stock of money being limited to fifty cents they rode some fifteen minutes at the end of which smith signalled to the conductor to stop we get out here he said to martin martin jumped out after him and they turned westward down one of the streets leading to the north river is it much farther asked martin not much its rather an outoftheway place for business isnt it remarked martin observing that the street was lined with dwellinghouses on either side for most kinds of business it is said his new acquaintance but it suits us we like a quiet outoftheway place are you in the wholesale business asked martin whose curiosity began to be considerably excited something of that sort answered the stranger ah here we are the house before which he stopped was a brick dwellinghouse of three stories the blinds were closed and it might have been readily supposed that no one lived there certainly nothing could have looked less like a place of business so far as outward appearance went and martin whose perceptions were not very acute saw this and was puzzled still his companion spoke so quietly and composedly and seemed to understand himself so well that he did not make any remark instead of pulling the bell mr smith drew a latchkey from his pocket and admitted himself come in mr martin he said martin stepped into the entry and the door was closed before him was a narrow staircase with a faded staircarpet upon it a door was partly open into a room on the right but still there was nothing visible that looked like business follow me said smith leading the way up stairs martin followed his curiosity if anything greater than before they went into a front room on the second floor excuse me a moment said smith martin was left alone but in two minutes smith returned with a tall powerfullooking man whose height was such that he narrowly escaped being a giant mr martin said smith this is my partner mr hayes proud to make your acquaintance i am sure mr hayes said martin affably i met your partner this mornin in an eatinhouse and he said you might have a job for me my health aint very good but i could do light work well enough did you tell mr martin said the giant in a hoarse voice that sounded as if he had a cold of several years standing that our business is of a confidential nature yes said martin i understand that i can keep a secret it is absolutely necessary that you should said hayes you say you can but how can i be sure of it ill give you my word said martin the giant looked down upon martin and ejaculated humph in a manner which might be interpreted to convey some doubt as to the value of martins word however even if martin had been aware of this he was not sensitive and would not have taken offence are you willing to take your oath that you will never reveal under any circumstances anything connected with our business yes said martin eagerly his curiosity being greater than ever there was a bible on the table hayes cast his eyes in that direction but first said something in a low voice to smith the latter drew a small brass key from his pocket and opened a cupboard or small closet in the wall from which considerably to martins alarm he drew out a revolver and a knife these he laid on the table beside the book whats that for asked martin with an uneasy glance at the weapons ill tell you what its for my friend said the giant its to show you what your fate will be if you ever reveal any of our secrets perhaps you dont want to take the risk of knowing what they are if you dont you can say so and go but martin did not want to go and he did want to learn the secrets more than ever im ready he said ill take the oath very well you understand now what it means put your hand on the book and repeat after me i solemnly swear on the penalty of death by pistol or knife never to reveal any secret i may have imparted to me in this room martin repeated this formula not without a certain shrinking not to say creeping of the flesh now that you have taken the oath said smith we will tell you our secret yes said martin eagerly the fact is said smith in a low voice we are counterfeiters you dont say so ejaculated martin yes theres a light genteel business for you there are all ways of making a living and that isnt the worst does it pay pretty well asked martin getting interested yes its a moneymaking business said smith with a laugh but theres a little prejudice against it and so we have a very quiet place of business yes i see said martin you see the world owes us a living continued smith as you remarked this morning and if it doesnt come in one way it must in another isnt it dangerous asked martin not if its carefully managed what do you want me to do supply money to our agents chiefly it wont do to have too many come to the house for it might excite suspicion you will come every morning receive money and directions from one of us and then do as you are bid how much will you give me what do you say to a hundred dollars a month in good money said martin his eyes sparkling with pleasure no of course not in money of our manufacture martins countenance fell first thing i know ill be nabbed he said not if you are careful well give you instructions do you accept our terms yes said martin unhesitatingly of course you take a risk no gain without risk you know but if you are unlucky remember your oath and dont betray us if you do youre a dead man within twentyfour hours from the time you leave the prison there are twenty men bound by a solemn oath to revenge treachery by death if you betray our secret nothing can save you do you understand yes said martin whose mind was suitably impressed with the absolute necessity of silence the representations of his new friends might or might not be true but at all events he believed them to be in earnest and their point was gained when do you want me to begin he asked today but first it will be necessary for you to be more decently dressed these are all the clothes i have returned martin ive been unfortunate and i havent had any money to buy good clothes with have we any clothes in the house that will fit this man asked smith of his confederate i will go and see the giant soon returned with a suit of clothing not very fine or very fashionable but elegant compared with that which martin now wore i guess these will fit you he said try them on martin made the change with alacrity and when it had been effected surveyed himself in a mirror with considerable complacency his temporary abstinence from liquor while at the island had improved his appearance and the new suit gave him quite a respectable appearance he had no objection to appearing respectable provided it were at other peoples expense on the whole he was in excellent spirits and felt that at length his luck had turned and he was on the high road to prosperity chapter xiv how rufus succeeded in business very little has been said of rufus in his business relations when he entered mr turners office he resolved to spare no pains to make himself useful and his services satisfactory to his employer he knew very well that he owed his situation entirely to the service which he had accidentally been able to do mr turner and that otherwise the latter would never have thought of selecting an officeboy from the class to which he belonged but rufus was resolved that whatever might have been his original motive he should never regret the selection he had made therefore he exerted himself more than under ordinary circumstances he would have done to do his duty faithfully he tried to learn all he could of the business and therefore listened attentively to all that was going on and in his leisure moments studied up the stock quotations so that he was able generally to give the latest quotations of prices of the prominent stocks in the market mr turner who was an observant man watched him quietly and was pleased with his evident pains to master the details of the business if rufus keeps on mr marston he said to his chief clerk one day he will make an excellent businessman in time he will indeed said the clerk he is always prompt and doesnt need to be told the same thing twice besides he has picked up a good deal of outside information he corrected me yesterday on a stock quotation he did me a great service at one time and i mean to push him as fast as he will bear it i have a great mind to increase his pay to ten dollars a week at once he has a little sister to take care of and ten dollars a week wont go far in these times plenty of boys can be got for less of course but he is one in a hundred it is better to pay him ten dollars than most boys five in accordance with this resolution when rufus who had gone to the bank returned mr turner called him rufus supposed it was to receive some new order and was surprised when instead his employer inquired how is your little sister rufus very well thank you sir have you a comfortable boardingplace yes sir how much board do you pay eight dollars a week for both of us sir that takes up the whole of your salary doesnt it yes sir but i have invested the money i had in a stationery store on sixth avenue and get a third of the profits with that i buy clothes for myself and sister and pay any other expenses we may have i see you are a great financier rufus i was not aware that you had a business outside of mine how long have you been with me about four months sir your services have been quite satisfactory i took you into the office for other reasons but i feel satisfied by what i have noticed of you that it will be well worth my while to retain your services thank you sir said rufus he was exceedingly gratified at this testimony as he had reason to be for he had already learned that mr turner was an excellent businessman and bore a high reputation in business circles for probity and capacity i intended at the end of six months pursued mr turner to raise your pay to ten dollars a week if you suited me but i may as well anticipate two months mr marston you will hereafter pay rufus ten dollars a week very well sir i am very much obliged to you mr turner said rufus gratefully i didnt expect to have my pay raised for a good while for i knew that i received more already than most officeboys i have tried to do my duty and shall continue to do so that is the right way rufus said his employer kindly it will be sure to win success you are working not only for me but most of all for yourself you are laying now the foundation of future prosperity when an opportunity occurs i shall promote you from the post of errandboy to a clerkship as i judge from what i have seen that you will be quite competent to fill such a position this intelligence was of course very gratifying to rufus he knew that as yet he was on the lowest round of the ladder and he had a commendable desire to push his way up he saw that mr turner was well disposed to help him and he resolved that he would deserve promotion when he returned home to supper he carried to miss manning and rose the tidings of his increase of pay and the encouraging words which had been spoken by mr turner i am not surprised to hear it rufus said miss manning i felt sure you would try to do your duty and i knew you had the ability to succeed thank you for your good opinion of me said rufus i can tell you of some one else who has a good opinion of you said miss manning who is it mrs clifton she said this forenoon that she considered you one of the most agreeable and wittiest young men she was acquainted with i suppose i ought to blush said rufus but blushing isnt in my line i hope mr clifton wont hear of it he might be jealous he doesnt seem much inclined that way said miss manning at this moment mrs clifton herself entered goodevening mr rushton she said where do you think i called this afternoon i couldnt guess at your store in sixth avenue i hope you bought something i expect my friends to patronize me yes i bought a package of envelopes i told mr black i was a friend of yours so he let me have it at the wholesale price then im afraid i didnt make anything on that sale when i want some dry goods may i tell your husband that i am a friend of yours and ask him to let me have it at the wholesale price certainly then i shall take an early opportunity to buy a spool of cotton can you sew i never took in any fine work to do but if youve got any handkerchiefs to hem ill do it on reasonable terms how witty you are mr rushton i am glad you think so mrs clifton i never found anybody else who could appreciate me several days had passed since the accidental encounter with martin outside of the academy of music rufus began to hope that he had gone out of the city though he hardly expected it such men as martin prefer to live from hand to mouth in a great city rather than go to the country where they would have less difficulty in earning an honest living at any rate he had successfully baffled martins attempts to learn where rose and he were boarding but he knew his stepfather too well to believe that he had got rid of him permanently he had no doubt he would turn up sooner or later and probably give him additional trouble he turned up sooner than rufus expected the next morning when on the way from the bank with a tin box containing money and securities he suddenly came upon martin standing in front of the general post office with a cigar in his mouth the respectable appearance which martin presented in his new clothes filled rufus with wonder and he could not avoid staring at his stepfather with surprise hillo said martin his eye lighting up with malicious pleasure so you didnt know me eh no said rufus im in business now im glad to hear it said rufus i get a hundred dollars a month im glad you are prosperous mr martin maybe youll be more willing to own the relationship now im glad for your sake only said rufus i can take care of rose well enough alone but i must be going all right ill go along with you i am in a hurry said rufus uneasily i can walk as fast as you said martin maliciously seein youre my stepson id like to know what sort of a place youve got the street being free to all rufus could not shake off his unwelcome companion nor could he evade him as it was necessary for him to go back to the office at once he consoled himself however by the reflection that at any rate martin wouldnt find out his boardingplace of which he was chiefly afraid as it might affect the safety of rose what have you got in that box asked martin i dont care to tell said rufus i know well enough its money and bonds youre in a brokers office aint you i cant stop to answer questions said rufus coldly im in a hurry ill find out in spite of you said martin you cant dodge me as easy as last time i aint so poor as i was do you see that as he spoke he drew out a roll of bills they were counterfeit but rufus of course was not aware of that and displayed them our hero was certainly astonished at this display of wealth on the part of his stepfather and was puzzled to understand how in the brief interval since he last saw him he could have become so favored by fortune but his conjectures were interrupted by his arrival at the office turner repeated martin to himself observing the sign so this is where my dootiful stepson is employed well im glad to know it itll come handy some day so saying he lighted a fresh cigar and sauntered away with the air of a man of independent means who had come down to wall street to look after his investments chapter xv the tin box i met my dootiful son this mornin remarked martin to his employer at their next interview did you said smith carelessly for he felt little interest in martins relations yes hes in business in wall street hows that asked smith his attention arrested by this statement hes with turner the banker he was going to the bank with a tin box under his arm id like to have the money there was in it did he tell you there was money in it no but ill bet there was enough in it to make a poor man rich perhaps so said smith thoughtfully how old is your son he inquired after a pause fifteen or sixteen ive forgotten which you see he isnt my own son i married his mother who was a widder with two children thats the way of it i suppose he doesnt live with you no hes an undootiful boy he haint no gratitude for all ive done for him he wouldnt care if i starved in the street that shows a bad disposition said smith who seemed disposed to protract the conversation for some purposes of his own yes said martin wiping his eyes pathetically with a red handkerchief hes an ungrateful young scamp hes set my little daughter rose aginst me she that set everything by me till he made her believe all sorts of lies about me why dont you come up with him i dont know how i suppose you would have no objections if i should tell you no said martin hesitating that is if it aint dangerous if i should give him a lickin in the street hed call the police and swear i wasnt his father that isnt what i mean ill think it over and tell you by and by now well talk about business it was not until the next day that smith unfolded to martin his plan of coming up with rufus it was of so bold a character that martin was startled and at first refused to have any part in it not from any conscientious scruples for martins conscience was both tough and elastic but solely because he was a coward and had a wholesome dread of the law but smith set before him the advantages which would accrue to him personally in so attractive a manner that at length he consented and the two began at once to concoct arrangements for successfully carrying out the little plan agreed upon not to keep the reader in suspense it was no less than forcibly depriving rufus of the tin box some morning on his way home from the bank this might bring rufus into trouble while martin and smith were to share the contents which judging from the wealth of mr turner were likely to be of considerable value there may be enough to make your fortune suggested smith if i dont get nabbed oh therell be no danger if you will manage things as i direct you ill have all the danger and youll share the profits grumbled martin isnt the idea mine retorted smith is it the soldiers who get all the credit for a victory or doesnt the general who plans the campaign receive his share besides i may have to manage converting the securities into cash there isnt one chance in a hundred of your getting into trouble if you do as i tell you but if you do remember your oath with this martin was forced to be contented he was only a common rascal while smith was one of a higher order and used him as a tool in the present instance despite his assurances smith acknowledged to himself that the plan he had proposed was really attended with considerable danger but this he ingloriously managed that martin should incur while he lay back and was ready to profit by it if it should prove successful meanwhile rufus was at work as usual quite unconscious of the danger which menaced him his encounter with martin gave him a little uneasiness for he feared that the latter might renew his attempts to gain possession of rose farther than this he had no fears he wondered at the sudden improvement in martins fortunes and could not conjecture what business he could have engaged in which would give him a hundred dollars a month he might have doubted his assertion but that his unusually respectable appearance and the roll of bills which he had displayed seemed to corroborate his statement he was glad that his stepfather was doing well having no spite against him provided he would not molest him and rose he decided not to mention to rose or miss manning that he had met martin as it might occasion them anxiety he contented himself by warning them to be careful as martin was no doubt still in the city and very likely prowling round in the hopes of finding out where they lived it was towards the close of business hours that mr marston the head clerk handed rufus a tin box saying rufus you may carry this round to the bank of the commonwealth yes sir said rufus it was one of his daily duties and he took the box as a matter of course and started on his errand when he first entered the office the feeling that property of value was committed to his charge gave him a feeling of anxious responsibility but now he had become used to it and ceased to think of danger probably he would have felt less security had he seen mr martin prowling about on the opposite side of the street his eyes attentively fixed on the entrance to mr turners office when martin saw rufus depart on his errand he threw away the cigar he had in his mouth and crossed the street he followed rufus closely unobserved by our hero to whom it did not occur to look back its a risky business thought martin rather nervously i wish i hadnt undertaken it ten to one ill get nabbed he was more than half inclined to give up his project but if he should do so he knew he would get into disgrace with his employers besides the inducements held out to him were not small he looked covetously at the tin box under the arm of rufus and speculated as to the value of the contents half of it would perhaps make him a rich man the stake was worth playing for and he plucked up courage and determined to proceed circumstances favored his design before going to the bank rufus was obliged to carry a message to an office on the second floor of a building on wall street this is my opportunity thought martin he quickened his steps and as rufus placed his foot on the lower step of the staircase he was close upon him hearing the step behind him our hero turned only in time to receive a violent blow in the face which caused him to fall forward he dropped the box as he fell which was instantly snatched by mr martin who lost no time in making his escape the blow was so violent that rufus was for the moment stunned it was only for a moment however he quickly recovered himself and at once realized his position he knew also that it was martin who had snatched the box for he had recognized him during the instant of time that preceded the blow he sprang to his feet and dashed into the street looking eagerly on either side for the thief but martin apprehending immediate pursuit had slipped into a neighboring doorway and making his way upstairs remained in concealment for ten minutes not suspecting this rufus hastened to nassau street and ran toward the bank looking about him eagerly for martin the latter in the mean while slipped out of the doorway and hurried by a circuitous course to fulton ferry where smith had arranged to meet him and relieve him of the tin box have you got it asked smith who had been waiting anxiously for over an hour here it is said martin and im glad to be rid of it i wouldnt do it again for a thousand dollars i hope youll get more than that out of it said smith cheerfully youve done well did you have much trouble not much but i had to work quick i followed him into a doorway and then grabbed it whenll you divide come round to the house this evening and well attend to it honor bright of course meanwhile rufus in a painful state of excitement ran this way and that in the faint hope of setting eyes upon the thief he knew very well that however innocent he had been in the matter and however impossible it was for him to foresee and prevent the attack the loss would subject him to suspicion and it might be supposed that he had connived at the theft his good character was at stake and all his bright prospects were imperilled meeting a policeman he hurriedly imparted to him the particulars of the theft and described martin a tall man with a blue coat and slouched hat repeated the officer i think i saw him turn into wall street half an hour ago was his nose red yes said rufus he hasnt come back this way or i should have seen him he must have gone the other way or else dodged into some side street or doorway ill go back with you the two went back together but it was too late martin was by this time at some distance hurrying towards fulton ferry rufus felt that the matter was too serious for him to manage alone and with reluctant step went back to the office to communicate his loss a formidable task was before him and he tried to prepare himself for it it would naturally be inferred that he had been careless if not dishonest and he knew that his formerly having been a street boy would weigh against him but whatever might be the consequences he knew that it was his duty to report the loss instantly chapter xvi mr vanderpool rufus entered the office as mr turner was about to leave it you were rather long he said were you detained i wish that was all mr turner said rufus his face a little pale what has happened asked the banker quickly the box was stolen from me as i was going upstairs to the office of foster nevins how did it happen tell me quickly i had only gone up two or three steps when i heard a step behind me turning to see who it was i was struck violently in the face and fell forward when i recovered the man had disappeared and the box was gone can i depend upon the absolute truth of this statement rufus asked mr turner looking in the boys face searchingly you can sir said rufus proudly can you give any idea of the appearance of the man who attacked you yes sir i saw him for an instant before the blow was given and recognized him you recognized him repeated the banker in surprise who is he our heros face flushed with mortification as he answered his name is martin he is my stepfather he has only just returned from blackwells island where he served a term of three months for trying to pick a mans pocket have you met him often since he was released asked mr turner he attempted to follow me home one evening from the academy of music but i dodged him i didnt want him to know where i boarded for fear he would carry off my little sister as he did once before did he know you were in my employ yes sir i met him day before yesterday as i was coming home from the postoffice and he followed me to the office he showed me a roll of bills and said he was getting a hundred dollars a month now tell me what you did when you discovered that you had been robbed i searched about for martin with a policeman but couldnt find him anywhere then i thought i had better come right back to the office and tell you about it i hope you dont think i was very much to blame mr turner not if your version of the affair is correct as i think it is i dont very well see how you could have foreseen or avoided the attack but there is one thing which in the minds of some might operate to your prejudice what is that sir asked rufus anxiously your relationship to the thief but he is my greatest enemy it might be said that you were in league with him and arranged to let him have the box after only making a show of resistance i hope you dont think that sir said our hero anxiously no i do not thank you for saying that sir now may i ask you one favor name it i want to get back that box will you give me a week to do it in what is your plan i would like to take a week out of the office during that time i will try to get on the track of martin if i find him i will do my best to get back the box mr turner deliberated a moment it may involve you in danger he said at length i dont care for the danger said rufus impetuously i know that i am partly responsible for the loss of the box and i want to recover it then no one can blame me or pretend that i had anything to do with stealing it i should feel a great deal better if you would let me try sir do you think there is any chance of your tracing this man martin he may leave the city i dont think he will sir i am inclined to grant your request rufus said the banker after a pause at the same time i shall wish you to call with me at the office of police and give all the information you are possessed of that they also may be on the lookout for the thief we had best go at once mr turner and rufus at once repaired to the police office and lodged such information as they possessed concerning the theft what were the contents of the box inquired the officer to whom the communication was made chiefly railroad and bank stocks was there any money four hundred dollars only were any of the securities negotiable there were two government bonds of five hundred dollars each they were registered however in the name of the owner james vanderpool one of our customers indeed the box was his and was temporarily in our care then there would be a difficulty about disposing of the bonds yes we may be able to get at the thief through them very probably he may be tempted to offer them for sale at some brokers office it is quite possible we will do our best to ferret out the thief the chances are good the thief will not be likely to profit much by his theft said mr turner when they were again in the street the four hundred dollars to be sure he can use but the railway and bank stocks will be valueless to him and the bonds may bring him into trouble still the loss of the securities is an inconvenience i shall be glad to recover them by the way mr vanderpool ought at once to be apprised of his loss you may go up there at once here is his address mr turner wrote upon a card the name james vanderpool no west twentyseventh street and handed it to rufus after seeing mr vanderpool you will come to my house this evening and report what he says assure him that we will do our best to recover the box i shall expect you during the week which i allow you to report yourself daily at the office to inform me of any clue which you may have obtained you may depend upon me sir said our hero rufus at once repaired to the address furnished him by mr turner another difficult and disagreeable task lay before him it is not a very pleasant commission to inform a man of the loss of property particularly when as in the present case the informant feels that the fault of the loss may be laid to his charge but rufus accepted the situation manfully feeling that however disagreeable it devolved upon him justly he took the university place cars and got out at twentyseventh street he soon found mr vanderpools address and ringing the bell was speedily admitted yes mr vanderpool is at home said the servant will you go up to his study rufus followed the servant up the front staircase and was ushered into a front room on the second floor there was a library table in the centre of the apartment at which was seated a gentleman of about sixty with irongray hair and features that bore the marks of sickness and invalidism mr vanderpool had inherited a large estate which by careful management had increased considerably he had never been in active business but having some literary and scientific tastes had been content to live on his income and cultivate the pursuits to which he was most inclined mr vanderpool said rufus in a tone of inquiry yes said that gentleman looking over his glasses that is my name do you want to speak to me i come from mr turner the banker said rufus ah yes mr turner is my man of business well what message do you bring to me from him i bring bad news mr vanderpool said our hero eh what ejaculated mr vanderpool nervously a tin box belonging to you was stolen this morning bless my soul how did that happen exclaimed the rich man in dismay rufus gave the account already familiar to the reader of the attack which had been made upon him why said mr vanderpool there were fifty thousand dollars worth of property in that box that would be a heavy loss there is no danger of losing all that said rufus the money i suppose will be lost and perhaps the government bonds may be disposed of but that will only amount to about fifteen hundred dollars the thief cant do anything with the stocks and shares are you sure of that asked mr vanderpool relieved yes sir mr turner told me so we have given information to the police mr turner has given me a week to find the thief you are only a boy said mr vanderpool curiously do you think you can do any good yes sir i think so said rufus modestly the box was taken from me and i feel bound to get it back if i can if i dont succeed the certificates of stock can be replaced well well it isnt so bad as it might be said mr vanderpool but are you not afraid of hunting up the thief he asked looking at rufus attentively no sir said rufus id just like to get hold of him thats all you would well now i would rather be excused i dont think i have much physical courage how old are you sixteen well i hope youll succeed i would rather not lose fifteen hundred dollars in that way though it might be a great deal worse i hope you dont blame me very much for having the box stolen from me no no you couldnt help it so the man knocked you down did he yes sir that must have been unpleasant did he hurt you much yes sir just at first but i dont feel it now by the way my young friend said mr vanderpool reaching forward to some loose sheets of manuscript upon the desk before him did you ever consider the question whether the planets were inhabited no sir said rufus staring a little i have given considerable time to the consideration of that question said mr vanderpool if you have time i will read you a few pages from a work i am writing on the subject i should be happy to hear them sir said rufus mentally deciding that mr vanderpool was rather a curious person the old gentleman cleared his throat and read a few pages which it will not be desirable to quote here though rather fanciful they were not wholly without interest and rufus listened attentively though he considered it a little singular that mr vanderpool should have selected him for an auditor he had the politeness to thank the old gentleman at the close of the reading i am glad you were interested said mr vanderpool gratified you are a very intelligent boy i shall be glad to have you call again thank you sir i will call and let you know what progress we make in finding the tin box oh yes i had forgotten i have no doubt you will do your best when you call again i will read you a few more extracts it seems to me a very important and interesting subject thank you sir i shall be very happy to call he dont seem to think much of his loss said our hero considerably relieved i was afraid he would find fault with me now mr martin i must do my best to find you chapter xvii dividing the spoils martin did not fail to go to the house occupied by his employers in the evening he was anxious to learn the amount of the booty which he had taken he decided that it must be ten thousand dollars at least half of this would be five thousand and this according to the agreement between them was to come to him it was quite a fortune and the thought of it dazzled martins imagination he would be able to retire from business and resolved to do so for he did not like the risk which he incurred by following his present employment martin had all his life wished to live like a gentleman that is to live comfortably without work and now his wish seemed likely to be gratified in the eyes of some five thousand dollars would seem rather a small capital to warrant such a life but it seemed a great deal to a shiftless character like him besides the box might contain more than ten thousand dollars and in that case of course his own share would be greater so on the whole it was with very pleasant anticipations that martin ascended the front steps of the counterfeiters den and rang the bell meanwhile smith had opened the box and his disappointment had been great when he found the nature of its contents actually but four hundred dollars were immediately available and as the banker no doubt had recorded the number of the government bonds there would be risk in selling them besides even if sold they would produce at the market price barely eleven hundred dollars as to the bank and railway shares they could not be negotiated and no doubt duplicates would be applied for so after all the harvest was likely to prove small especially as smith had passed his word to divide with martin after a while it occurred to him that as martin did not know the contents of the box he could easily be deceived into supposing them less than they were he must tell a falsehood but then smiths conscience was tough and he had told a great many in the course of his life when martin was ushered into the room he found his confederate looking rather sober have you opened the box inquired martin eagerly yes said smith rather contemptuously a great haul you made i must say wasnt there anything in it asked martin in dismay yes there were plenty of bank and railroad shares cant we sell them queried martin whose knowledge of business was limited you must be a fool we cant sell them without the owners indorsement perhaps youll call and ask him for it cant we do anything with them then asked martin anxiously nothing at all wasnt there nothing else in the box yes there was a government bond for five hundred dollars smith concluded to mention only one thats something yes its something you can sell it after a while and bring me half the money will there be any danger in selling it none to speak of said smith who was afraid martin might decline selling it unless he gave this assurance wasnt there any money asked martin disappointed yes there was a trifle a hundred dollars answered his unscrupulous confederate who was certainly cheating martin in the most barefaced manner half of that belongs to me said martin of course it does do you think i wouldnt treat you fair no said his dupe i know mr smith youre a man of honor of course i am id like to see anybody say i wasnt ive left everything in the box just as it was so you might see it was all right he went to the cupboard and unlocking it produced the box of which he lifted the lid the certificates of stock were at the bottom above them folded up was the fivetwenty u s bond for five hundred dollars and upon it a small roll of greenbacks you see its just as i say martin said smith with an air of frankness theres the shares that we cant do anything with heres the bond and theres the money just take and count it i may have been mistaken in the amount martin counted the roll of bills and made out just one hundred dollars of course he could not be expected to know that there had been three hundred more which together with the other bond were carefully concealed in his confederates breastpocket yes its just a hundred dollars he said after finishing the count well take fifty of them and put in your pocket martin did so it aint what i expected he said rather ruefully if id knowed there was so little in the box i wouldnt have taken it well its better than nothing said smith who could afford to be philosophical having appropriated to himself seveneighths of the money and threefourths of the bonds theres the bond you know let me see it smith extended it to martin when shall i sell it asked he not just yet wait till the affair blows over a little do you think theres any danger then queried martin anxiously not much still its best to be prudent hadnt you better sell it yourself suppose i did said smith i might take the notion to walk off with all the money i dont think you would said martin surveying his confederate doubtfully nevertheless no i dont think i would but if you sell it yourself youll have the affair in your own hands but i might walk off with all the money too said martin who thought it a poor rule that didnt work both ways i dont think you would said smith and ill tell you why we belong to a large band that are bound together by a terrible oath to punish any one guilty of treachery suppose you played me false and did as you say though of course i know you dont mean it i wouldnt give that for your life and he snapped his fingers dont said martin with a shudder you make me shiver of course i didnt mean anything im on the square certainly i only told you what would happen to you or me or any one that was false to the others i think id rather have you sell the bond said martin nervously if i were in your case id be perfectly willing but the fact is the brokers know me too well they suspect me and they wont suspect you i think ive had my share of the risk grumbled martin i dont see but i do the work and you share the profits wasnt it i that put you up to it demanded smith would you ever have thought of it if it hadnt been for me maybe i wouldnt i wish i hadnt youre a fool then dont you see its turned out all right havent you got fifty dollars in your pocket and wont you have two hundred and fifty more when the bond is sold i thought id get five thousand said martin dissatisfied it seems to me that three hundred dollars is pretty good pay for one mornings work but then there are some people that are never satisfied it wasnt the work it was the danger i aint at all sure but the boy saw me and knew who i was if he did ive got to keep out of the way do you think he did recognize you asked smith thoughtfully im not sure im afraid he did i wish wed got him in our clutches but i dare say he was too frightened to tell who it was he aint easy frightened said martin shaking his head he understood our hero better than his confederate well all is you must be more careful for a few days instead of staying in the city ill send you to jersey city newark and other places where you wont be likely to meet him that might do said martin hes a smart boy though hes an undootiful son he dont care no more for me than if i was no kith nor kin to him and he just as lieves see me sent to prison as not theres one thing you havent thought of said smith whats that his employer will most likely think that the boy has stolen the box or had something to do with its being carried off as he took him out of the street he wont have much confidence in his honesty i shouldnt be at all surprised if this undootiful boy of yours as you call him found himself locked up in the tombs on account of this little affair do you think so said martin brightening up at the suggestion i think it more likely than not if that is the case of course you wont be in any danger from him thats so said martin cheerfully i hope youre right it would be worth something to have that young imp locked up he wouldnt put on so many airs after that well its very likely to happen the contemplation of this possibility so raised martins spirits that in spite of the disappointment he had experienced in finding the booty so far below what he had anticipated he became quite cheerful especially after smith produced a bottle of whiskey and asked him to help himself an invitation which he did not have occasion to repeat chapter xviii rufus entrapped now said rufus to himself on the morning succeeding the robbery ive got a week to recover that box how shall i go about it this was a question easier asked than answered martin being the thief the first thing of course was to find him and rufus had considerable hopes of encountering him in the street some day should this be the case he might point him out to a policeman and have him arrested at once but this would not recover the box probably it was concealed at martins boardinghouse and this it was that rufus was anxious to find he decided therefore whenever he got on the track of his stepfather to follow him cautiously until he ascertained where he lodged he walked the street with his eyes about him all day but did not catch a glimpse of martin the fact was the latter was at newark having been sent there by his employers with a supply of counterfeit money to dispose of so that our heros search was of course fruitless and so he was obliged to report to mr turner the next morning probably he is in hiding said his employer i dont think you have much chance of meeting him for a few days to come i should like to try said rufus he wont be content to hide long i have notified the banks and railroad companies of the robbery said mr turner so that it will be impossible to sell the shares after a while should we fail to recover them they will grant us duplicate certificates i have advertised also the numbers of the bonds and if an attempt is made to dispose of them the thief will find himself in trouble so the loss is reduced to four hundred dollars that is too much to lose said rufus that is true but we are lucky to get off so cheap i hope to get back some of that said our hero stoutly did it ever strike you that there might be some risk encountering this man if he is driven to bay he may become dangerous i dont think of the danger mr turner said rufus i lost that box and it is my duty to recover it if i can danger or no danger mr turner secretly admired the pluck of rufus but he was not a man given to compliments so he only said quietly well rufus you shall have the week i promised you i have no doubt you will do your best i shall not be surprised however if you fail so rufus entered upon his second days search he went up chatham street and explored most of the streets intersecting it visiting many places which he remembered as former haunts of his stepfather but he was quite off the track here martins employment now was on the other side of the city near the north river and he had no longer occasion to visit his old haunts besides he had again been sent over to new jersey and did not get back to the city at all till late in the afternoon the next day martin complained of headache and was permitted to remain at home he did not think it prudent to be out during the day but easily solaced himself in his confinement with whiskey and cigars of which he had laid in a good supply he was sitting in his shirtsleeves at the front window looking through the blinds which were always closed when his eyes lighted on rufus passing on the opposite side of the street hes looking for me exclaimed martin to himself observing that rufus was looking about him as he walked whos looking for you asked his confederate smith who happened just then to enter the room my undootiful son look there he is said martin nervously i wonder if he has heard about my living here smith went to the window and looked out he looks resolute and determined said smith we must pull his teeth what do you mean i mean we must put it out of his power to do you harm how are we going to do that wait a minute and ill tell you smith left the room hastily and after a brief interval returned i think ill fetch it he said what have you done asked martin ive sent humpy to follow your son hes to carry him a message from you what do you mean asked martin alarmed dont be afraid its all right but i dont understand it i didnt send any message what was it ill tell you if im not mistaken humpy will bring your son back with him so that i shall have the pleasure of reuniting parent and child you dont mean to say you are going to bring rufus here said martin his lower jaw falling you aint going to betray me are you stuff and nonsense what are you thinking of all you need understand is that the boy is getting dangerous he is following you round as if he meant something and that must be stopped i mean to get him into the house but i dont mean to part company with him very soon smith here briefly detailed the instructions which he had given to his errandboy martin listened with much satisfaction what a head youve got he said admiringly im generally ready for an emergency remarked smith complacently youve got to get up early in the morning to get ahead of me we must now follow smiths messenger and we shall ascertain that gentlemans plan humpy was a boy of sixteen very short in fact almost a dwarf and as his name implies disfigured by a hump he was sharp however and secretive and though he could not help understanding the character of the men who employed him was not likely to betray them he had a pride in deserving the confidence which he saw was reposed in him after receiving the instructions of his principal he crossed the street and followed rufus at a little distance being particular to keep him in sight our hero turned a corner and so did he he then quickened his pace and came up with him was you alookin for anybody in particular he said what makes you ask said rufus facing round upon him maybe i could help you perhaps you know who i am after said rufus looking at him steadily youre looking for a man named martin aint you do you know where i can find him asked rufus eagerly yes i do he sent me after you he sent you repeated our hero hardly believing his ears yes he wants to see you what does he want to see me for asked rufus inclined to be suspicious theres something hes got of yours that he wants to return said humpy in a low voice looking around cautiously rufus was more and more astonished was it possible that martins conscience troubled him and that he wanted to make restitution he could hardly believe this knowing what he did of his stepfather martin was about the last man he would have suspected of being troubled in any such way yes he has got something of mine he said aloud does he want to return it yes hes sorry he took it hes afraid youll set the copps on him so hes frightened thought rufus this seemed to throw light on the new phase of affairs he had never regarded his stepfather as very brave and now concluded that he was alarmed about the consequences of the theft if hell return what he took all right said rufus venturing to make this promise on his own responsibility he shant be touched where is he not far off said humpy tell him to bring it to me and ill give my word not to have him arrested he cant come why cant he hes sick where in a house near by he wants you to come and see him rufus hesitated whats the matter with him he asked he caught a cold and is threatened with a fever said the boy glibly if you want to see him ill lead you where he is all right go ahead said rufus thoroughly deceived by the boys plausible story youll promise not to set the copps on him after youve got the box said humpy yes i promise then follow me rufus followed congratulating himself that things were coming out satisfactorily he had no hesitation in making the promise he did for he felt sure that he would be sustained by his employer at any rate he determined that having pledged his word to martin nothing should make him break it humpy stumped along followed by rufus they turned the corner again and the boy guided him at once to the counterfeiters den hes in there said humpy with a jerk of his forefinger come along he mounted the steps and opened the door which had been left unlocked hes upstairs said humpy come up rufus without suspicion followed his humpbacked guide up the narrow staircase they had scarcely reached the top when smith coming out of a room on the floor below locked the outer door and put the key in his pocket this rufus did not see or it would have aroused his suspicion the boy opened the door of a chamber at the head of the staircase go in there he said rufus entered and looked around him but saw no one he did not have to wait long a step was heard at the door and james martin entered the room apparently in perfect health im glad to see you rufus he said with a triumphant grin youve been such an undootiful son that i didnt much expect youd come to see your sick father rufus sprang to his feet in dismay the whole plot flashed upon him at once and he realized that he had walked into a trap with his eyes wide open chapter xix in a trap our heros first impulse on finding himself entrapped was to escape he sprang towards the door but martin quickly grasped him by the arm and forced him back no you dont he said with emphasis i want you to stay with me let me go exclaimed rufus struggling to escape sorry i couldnt oblige you said martin with a grin cant you stay with your sick father a few days youve played me a mean trick said rufus indignantly what was you walkin through this street for asked martin wasnt it because you wanted to see me yes answered our hero well youve got what you wanted said martin smiling maliciously i knowd youd never find me if i didnt send out for you was there anything particlar you wish to say to me yes said rufus bluntly i want you to give me back that tin box you stole from me the other day what do i know about any tin box asked martin not knowing that it had been spoken of by humpy in the street you neednt deny it mr martin the boy you sent after me told me you took it he did did he said martin seeing that he must try another tack well sposin i did what then the law may have something to say youll stand a chance of going to sing sing for a few years youd have to prove i took it said martin uneasily i only told the boy to say so sos to get you in here i read about the robbery in the papers i recognized you at the time and am ready to swear to you said rufus firmly this was rather imprudent for it made martin even more determined to prevent our heros escape if thats your game he said ill see you dont get a chance to swear to any lies what do you mean to do with me demanded rufus i aint decided yet said martin your healths so delicate that i dont think itll agree with you to go out in the street are you going to confine me here maybe said his stepfather i shant charge you nothing for board your cheerful companyll pay me for that mr martin said rufus ive got a proposition to make to you go ahead and make it then youve got yourself into a scrape about that tin box i thought you was the one that had got into a scrape said martin jocularly so i have but mine is of a different kind from yours you run the risk of going to prison and youre in prison already said martin with a grin seems to me ive got the best of it so far perhaps you have but i wouldnt exchange with you for all that now ive got a proposition to make thats what you said before if you will restore the tin box and let me go free ill see that you are not arrested for what youve done youre very kind said martin but that wont pay me for my trouble if ill get you out of your present danger i dont know about that sposin i was to do as you say the first thing youd do after you got out would be to set the copps on me no i wouldnt id go to prison first myself this proposition had some effect upon martin he realized that he was in danger and felt that he had been very poorly paid for his risk and trouble he was inclined to believe rufus would keep his word but he knew also that matters had gone too far smith he was sure would not consent to any such arrangement and without him he could do nothing besides it was a satisfaction to him to feel that he had rufus in his power and he had no desire to lose that advantage by setting him free tyrant and bully as he was by nature he meant to gratify his malice at our heros expense i couldnt do it rufus he said theres another man in it and hes got the box rufus looked sharply at martin to ascertain if he was speaking the truth he decided that it was as his stepfather stated and if this was the case he would have more than one enemy to deal with does the other man live here he asked maybe he does and maybe he doesnt who is he maybe its the emperor of chiny and maybe it isnt what would you give to know not much said rufus assuming an indifferent tone youre the man that took the box thats enough for me he put me up to it said martin unguardedly i thought martin wasnt smart enough to plan the robbery himself said rufus to himself he resolved to appear indifferent to this information in the hope of learning more you can settle that among yourselves he said quietly if you consented to do it youre as much to blame as he at this moment smith influenced by curiosity opened the door and entered this is my undootiful son mr smith said martin so his names smith thought rufus i wonder whether its his real name or a false one im glad to see you young man said smith so youve called to see your father he isnt my father you see how undootiful he is said martin he wont own me well teach him to be more dutiful before we get through with him said smith mr smith said rufus im not here of my own accord i dare say you know that but as long as i am here id like to ask you if you know anything about a tin box that was taken from me the other day by mr martin by your father by mr martin said rufus determined not to admit the relationship what should i know about it mr martin tells me that though he took it somebody else set him to do it i thought you might be the one did you say that demanded smith looking angrily at martin i was only foolin returned martin who began to think he had made a blunder its my belief that youre a fool retorted smith youd better be careful what you tell your son young man turning to rufus as to the tin box you speak of i can tell you nothing your father says that he has recovered some property which you stole from him a while since and i suppose that may be the tin box you refer to that isnt true it belonged to mr turner my employer or rather to a customer of his thats nothing to me mr martin boards with me and as long as he pays for his board i dont want to pry into his affairs if he has taken a tin box from you i presume he had a better right to it than you had are you going to bring your son down to dinner mr martin i guess hed better eat his victuals up here said martin just as you say i can send humpy with them we shall have dinner in about an hour all right ill go down now if my dootiful son can spare me as rufus did not urge him to stay martin left the room with smith taking care to lock the door after him whats the boys name asked smith abruptly rufus hes smart i can tell that by his looks yees hes smart enough said martin hesitatingly but hes as obstinate as a pig likes to have his own way eh thats what he does hed make a good boy for our business said smith musingly martin shook his head it wouldnt do he said why not he wants to be honest said martin contemptuously we couldnt trust him then theres only one thing to do whats that we must keep him close we mustnt on any account allow him to escape ill look after that said martin nodding ive had hard work enough to get hold of him he wont get away in a hurry if he does youll be arrested and you too suggested martin why should i didnt you put me up to taking the box and havent you taken half what was in it look here said smith menacingly youd better stop that youve already told the boy more than you ought if you are taken through your own carelessness mind what you are about and dont split on me if you do itll be the worse days work you ever did imprisonment isnt the worse thing that can happen to a man martin understood what his confederate meant and the intended effect was produced he began to think that smith was a desperate man and capable of murdering him or instigating his murder in case of treachery this made him feel rather uneasy in spite of his capture of rufus meanwhile our hero left to himself began to examine the apartment in which he was confined the door had been locked by martin as we have already said this was the only mode of exit from the apartment except what was afforded by two windows rufus walked to them and looked out the room was in the back part of the house and these windows looked out into a back yard he could see the rear portions of the houses on a parallel street and speculated as to the chances of escape this way as the room was only on the second floor the distance to the ground was not great he could easily swing off the windowsill without injury though he knew it would not be well to attempt escape now when martin and smith were doubtless on the lookout he thought he would open the window softly and take a survey he tried one window but could not raise it he tried the other with like want of success he thought at first that the difficulty lay in their sticking but on closer examination he ascertained that both were firmly fastened by nails which accounted for their being immovable chapter xx humpy i might break the window thought rufus but it occurred to him at once that the noise would probably be heard besides if there was any one in the room below he would very likely be seen descending from the window if this plan were adopted at all he must wait till evening meanwhile some other way of escape might suggest itself the room was of moderate size about fifteen feet square a cheap carpet covered the floor a pine bedstead occupied one corner there were three or four chairs a bureau and a bedstead rufus sat down and turned the matter over in his mind he couldnt make up his mind what martins business was but decided that it was something unlawful and that he was either employed by smith or connected in some way with him it seemed to him probable that his stepfather in waylaying him and stealing the tin box had acted under the direction of smith and that probably the box was at that very moment in the possession of the superior villain if i could only find the box and escape with it thought rufus that would set me right with mr turner but there seemed little chance of that it did not seem very probable even that he could escape from the room in which he was confined much less carry out the plan he had in view while he was thinking over his situation the key turned in the lock and the door was opened rufus looked up expecting to see martin but instead of his stepfather there entered the boy already referred to as humpy humpy carried in his hand a plate of meat and vegetables heres your dinner he said laying the plate down while he locked the door behind him look here johnny said rufus you served me a mean trick humpy chuckled you came in just as innocent he said it was jolly maybe it is but i dont see it you told me a lie didnt you find the man you was after said humpy you told me he was sick so he is hes in delicate health and couldnt go to business today what is his business asked rufus a little too eagerly humpy put his thumbs to his nose and twirled his fingers with a grin of intelligence dont you wish you knew he said tantalizingly do you know anything about the tin box asked rufus seeing that his former question was not likely to be answered maybe i do its in this house oh is it well if you know that theres no use of my telling you i cant make much of him thought rufus hes a young imp and it isnt easy to get round him he looked at humpy meditatively and it occurred to him whether it would not be well to spring upon him snatch the key release himself from the room and dash downstairs so far as the boy was concerned this plan was practicable rufus was much his superior in strength and could master him without difficulty but doubtless martin and smith were below they would hear the noise of the struggle and would cut off his flight evidently that plan would not work another suggested itself to him johnny said he dont you want to make some money here he attacked the boy on his weak side humpy was fond of money he had already scraped together about twenty dollars from the meagre pay he received and had it carefully secreted of course i do he answered howm i to do it ill tell you that tin box contained property of value it doesnt belong to me it belongs to mr turner the banker i was trying to recover it when you got me to come in here this morning now what i want to say is this get that tin box for me and help me to get away with it and itll be worth fifty dollars to you fifty dollars humpys eyes sparkled when he heard the sum named but prudence came to his aid fortified by suspicion whos agoin to pay it he asked mr turner sposin he dont then i will whered you raise the money im not rich but im worth a good deal more than that id rather pay it out of my own pocket than not get back that box but if humpy was fond of money he had also a rude sense of honor which taught him to be faithful to his employer he did want the money and then there was something in our heros look that made him pretty sure that he would keep his promise so he put away the seductive temptation though reluctantly i aint agoin to do it he said doggedly perhaps youll think better of it said rufus who in spite of the boys manner saw the struggle in his mind if you do just let me know ive got to be goin said humpy and unlocking the door he went out locking it again directly rufus turned his attention to the dinner which he found of good quality despite his imprisonment his appetite was excellent and he ate all there was of it i must keep up my strength at any rate he said to himself i may need it meanwhile as there was no longer anything to dread rufus being a prisoner martin went out in the service of his employer now thought he reflecting with satisfaction on his signal triumph over rufus if i only knew where rose was id go after her and her brother shouldnt get hold of her again in a hurry hes got enough to do to take care of himself this was pleasant to think about but martin had not the least idea where rose was and was not likely to find out meanwhile something happened in the counterfeiters den which was destined to prove of advantage to rufus smith sent humpy out on an errand the boy was detained unavoidably and returned an hour later than he was expected smith was already in an illtemper which the late return of his emissary aggravated what made you so late he demanded with lowering brow i couldnt help it said humpy dont tell me that roared smith you stopped to play on the way i know you did no i didnt said humpy angrily do you dare to contradict me you villanous little humpback screamed smith ill teach you to do it again illustration ill teach you to do it again he clutched the boy by the collar and seizing a horsewhip brought it down with terrible force on the boys shrinking form let me go dont beat me screamed humpy in mingled fear and rage not till ive cured you retorted smith twice more he struck the humpbacked boy with the whip and then threw him on the floor thats what you get for contradicting me he said the boy rose slowly and painfully and limped out of the room his face was pale but his heart was filled with a burning sense of humiliation and anger against the man who had assaulted him it would have been well for smith if he had controlled himself better for the boy was not one of the forgiving kind but harbored resentment with an indianlike tenacity and was resolved to be revenged he crawled upstairs to the small attic room in which he usually slept and entering threw himself upon the bed face downward where he burst into a passion of grief shame and rage which shook his crooked form convulsively this lasted for fifteen minutes when he became more quiet then he got up slowly and going to a corner of the room lifted up a board from which the nails appeared to have been drawn out and drew from beneath a calico bag this he opened and exposed to view a miscellaneous collection of coins which he took out and counted twenty dollars and nineteen cents he said to himself ive been moren a year gettin it that boy offers me fifty dollars most three times as much if ill get him the tin box and help him to escape i said i wouldnt do it but he hadnt struck me then he hadnt called me a villanous humpback now hes got to pay for it hell wish he hadnt done it and the boy clenched his fist and shook it vindictively now howll i get the box he sat on the bed thinking for some time then composing his countenance he went downstairs he resolved to assume his usual manner in order not to excite smiths suspicion smith had by this time got over his rage and was rather sorry he had struck the boy so brutally for he knew very well that humpy might prove a dangerous enemy he glanced at humpys face when he came downstairs but saw nothing unusual oh hell forget all about it he thought to himself heres ten cents humpy he said maybe i struck you too hard go and buy yourself some candy thank you said the boy taking the money ive another errand for you he told what it was go and come back as soon as possible humpy went quietly and returned in good season about five oclock martin not yet having returned smith directed him to carry up our heros supper there was a little exultant sparkle in the boys eye as he took the plate of buttered bread and started to go upstairs so its you is it said rufus on the boys entrance where is martin he aint come in yet do you want to see him no im not particular about it humpy stood looking earnestly at rufus while he was eating the bread and butter at length he said ive been thinkin over what you said to me at dinnertime shall i get the fifty dollars certain sure if i do what you want yes said rufus eagerly get me the tin box and help me to escape and the money shall be yours honor bright honor bright chapter xxi suspense rufus generally reached his boardinghouse at halfpast five oclock sometimes rose and her two young companions were playing in washington park at that time and ran to meet him when he appeared in sight but on the night of our heros capture by martin they waited for him in vain where can rufie be thought rose as she heard six oclock peal from a neighboring churchtower she thought he might have gone by without her seeing him and with this idea as it was already the hour for dinner she went into the house she ran upstairs two steps at a time and opened the door of her own room you should not have stayed out so late rose said miss manning you will hardly have time to get ready for dinner i was waiting for rufie has he come no he seems to be late tonight i am afraid hes got run over said rose anxiously rufus is old enough to take care of himself ive no doubt hes quite safe then what makes him so late he is probably detained by business but there is the bell we must go down to dinner cant we wait for rufie no my dear child we cannot tell when he will be home it dont seem a bit pleasant to eat dinner without rufie complained rose it isnt often he stays rose hell tell us all about it when he comes they went down and took their seats at the dinnertable where is your brother rose asked mrs clifton he hasnt got home said rose rather disconsolately i am sorry for that he is a very agreeable young man if i wasnt married simpered mrs clifton i should set my cap for him but i mustnt say that or mr clifton will be jealous oh dont mind me said mr clifton carelessly it wont spoil my appetite i dont think theres anything that would spoil your appetite said his wife rather sharply for she would have been flattered by her husbands jealousy just so said mr clifton coolly may i trouble you for some chicken mrs clayton youre a great deal too old for rufie mrs clifton said rose with more plainness than politeness im not quite so young as you are rose said mrs clifton somewhat annoyed how old do you think i am most fifty answered rose honestly mercy sake exclaimed mrs clifton horrified what a child you are why dont you say a hundred and done with it how old are you mrs clifton persisted rose well if you must know i shall be twentyfive next november mrs clifton was considerably nearer thirtyfive but then some ladies are very apt to be forgetful of their age the dinnerhour passed and rose and miss manning left the table they went upstairs hoping that rufus might be there before them but the room was empty an hour and a half passed and it was already beyond eight the hour at which rose usually went to bed cant i sit up a little later tonight miss manning pleaded rose i want to see rufie no rose i think not youll see him in the morning so rose unwillingly undressed and went to bed by this time miss manning began to wonder a little why rufus did not appear it seemed to her rather strange that he should be detained by business till after eight oclock and she thought that an accident might possibly have happened to him still rufus was a strong manly boy well able to take care of himself and this was not probable when ten oclock came and he had not yet made his appearance she went downstairs the door of the hall bedroom which rufus occupied was open and empty this she saw on the way in the hall below she met mrs clayton rufus has not yet come in she said interrogatively no i have not seen him i saved some dinner for him thinking he might have been detained i cant think why he doesnt come home i think he must be here soon do you know if he has a latchkey yes he got a new one of me the other day perhaps he has gone to some place of amusement he would not go without letting us know beforehand he would know we would feel anxious yes he is more considerate than most young men of his age i dont think you need feel anxious about him miss manning went upstairs disappointed she began to feel perplexed and anxious suppose something should happen to rufus what would they do rose would refuse to be comforted she was glad the little girl was asleep otherwise she would be asking questions which she would be unable to answer it was now her hour for retiring but she resolved to sit up a little longer more than an hour passed and still rufus did not come it seemed unlikely that he would return that night and miss manning saw that it was useless to sit up longer it was possible however that he might have come in and gone at once to his room thinking it too late to disturb them but on going down to the next floor she saw that his room was still unoccupied rose woke up early in the morning miss manning was already awake did rufie come last night asked the little girl he had not come when i went to bed was the answer perhaps he came in afterwards may i dress and go down and see yes if you would like to rose dressed quicker than usual and went downstairs she came up again directly with a look of disappointment miss manning he is not here she said his chamber door is open and i saw that he had not slept in his bed very likely mr turner sent him out of the city on business said miss manning with an indifference which she did not feel i wish hed come said rose i shall give him a good scolding when he gets home for staying away so long has not mr rushton come asked mrs clayton at the breakfasttable not yet i suppose he is detained by business just after breakfast miss manning as usual took the three little girls out in the park to play it was their custom to come in about nine oclock to study this morning however their governess went to mrs colman and said i should like to take this morning if you have no objection i am feeling a little anxious about rufus who did not come home last night i would like to go to the office where he is employed and inquire whether he has been sent out of town on any errand certainly miss manning the little girls can go out and play in the park while you are gone thank you where are you going miss manning asked rose seeing that the governess was preparing to go out i am going to rufies office to see why he stayed away may i go with you asked rose eagerly no rose you had better stay at home the streets are very crowded down town and i shouldnt like to venture to cross broadway with you you can go and play in the park and shant we have any lessons not this morning that will be nice said rose who like most girls of her age enjoyed a holiday miss manning walked to broadway and took a stage that she knew would carry her as far as wall street only a few rods from mr turners office she had seldom been in a stage the stage fare being higher than in the cars and even four cents made a difference to her she would have enjoyed the brilliant scene which broadway always presents with its gay shopwindows and hurrying multitudes if her mind had not been preoccupied at length trinity spire came in sight when they reached the great church which forms so prominent a landmark in the lower part of broadway she got out and turned into wall street it did not take her long to find mr turners number she had never been there before and had never met mr turner and naturally felt a little diffident about going into the office it was on the second floor she went up the stairway and timidly entered she looked about her but rufus was not to be seen at first no one noticed her but finally a clerk with a pen behind his ear came out from behind the line of desks what can i do for you maam he asked is rufus rushton here she inquired no he is not was he here yesterday hes out of the office just now on some business of mr turners thats mr turner if you would like to speak to him miss manning turned and saw mr turner just entering the office he was a pleasantlooking man and this gave her courage to address him mr turner she said i came to ask about rufus rushton he did not come home last night and i am feeling anxious about him indeed said the banker i am surprised to hear that it leads me to think that he may have found a clue to the stolen box the stolen box repeated miss manning in surprise yes did he not tell you of it no sir mr turner briefly related the particulars already known to the reader i think he said in conclusion rufus must have tracked the man martin and martin interrupted miss manning was he the thief yes so rufus tells me do you know him i have good reason to he is a very bad man i hope he has not got rufus in his power i dont think you need feel apprehensive rufus is a smart boy and knows how to take care of himself hell come out right i have no doubt i am glad to hear you say so mr turner i will bid you goodmorning with thanks for your kindness if rufus comes in this morning i will let him go home at once that your anxiety may be relieved with this assurance miss manning departed she had learned something but in spite of the bankers assurance she felt troubled she knew martin was a bad man and she was afraid rufus would come to harm chapter xxii martin grows suspicious our heros interview with humpy gave him new courage when he had felt surrounded by enemies the chances seemed against him now he had a friend in the house who was interested in securing his escape not only this but there was a fair chance of recovering the box for which he was seeking on the whole therefore rufus was in very good spirits about nine oclock he heard a step on the stairs which he recognized as that of his stepfather he had good reason to remember that step many a time while his mother was alive and afterwards while they were living in leonard street he had listened to it coming up the rickety staircase and dreaded the entrance of the man whose presence was never welcome after some fumbling at the lock the door opened and martin entered it was dark and he could not at first see rufus where are you you young villain he inquired with a hiccough rufus did not see fit to answer when thus addressed where are you i say repeated martin here i am answered rufus why didnt you speak before didnt you hear me demanded his stepfather angrily yes mr martin i heard you said rufus composedly then why didnt you answer because you called me a young villain well you are one rufus did not answer martin locked the door and put the key in his pocket he next struck a match and lit the gas then seating himself in a rockingchair still with his hat on he looked at rufus with some curiosity mingled with triumph i hope you like your accommodations he said pretty well we dont charge you nothing for board you see and you havent any work to do thats what i call living like a gentleman i believe you tried the same kind of life at blackwells island said rufus look here said martin roughly youd better not insult me i didnt come here to be insulted what did you come for then asked rufus i thought youd like to know how rose was answered martin i dont believe you have seen her well you neednt believe it perhaps i didnt meet her on the street and follow her home she begged me to tell her where you was but i couldnt do it rufus felt a temporary uneasiness when he heard this statement but there was something in martins manner which convinced him that he had not been telling the truth he decided to change the subject mr martin he said have you made up your mind to give up that tin box no i havent i cant spare it if you will give it up i will see that you are not punished for taking it i aint agoin to be punished for taking it you certainly will be if you are caught what do you know about it there was a man convicted of the same thing three months ago and he got five years for it i dont believe it said martin uneasily you neednt if you dont want to i havent got the box now so i couldnt give it back smiths got it is that the man i saw this morning yes then youd better ask him to give it back to you he wouldnt do it if i asked him then im sorry for you martin was not very brave and in spite of his assertions he felt uneasy at what rufus was saying besides he felt rather afraid of our hero he knew that rufus was a resolute determined boy and that he could not keep him confined forever some time he would get out and martin feared that he would set the officers on his track the remark of smith that he would make a good boy for their business occurred to him and he determined to try him on a new tack if he could get him compromised by a connection with their business it would be for his interest also to keep clear of the police rufus said martin edging his chair towards our hero im your friend rufus was rather astonished at this sudden declaration im glad to hear it he said but i dont think youve treated me in a very friendly manner about the tin box yes partly that if youre my friend you will return it and not keep me locked up here never mind rufus ive got a business proposal to make to you youre a smart boy i am glad you think so and i can give you a chance to make a good living i am making a good living now or i was before you interfered with me how much did you earn a week why do you want to know was it over ten dollars a week about that i know a business that will pay you fifteen dollars a week what is it it is the one im in i earn a hundred dollars a month if you are earning as much as that i shouldnt think youd need to steal tin boxes there wasnt much in it only a hundred dollars in money you are not telling me the truth there were four hundred dollars in it what was that you said asked martin pricking up his ears there were four hundred dollars in it how do you know mr turner told me so smith told me there were only a hundred he opened it and gave me half then he gave you fifty and kept three hundred and fifty himself if i thought that id smash his head said martin angrily make me run all the risk and then cheat me out of my hard earnins do you call that fair i think hes been cheating you said rufus not sorry to see martins anger with his confederate its a mean trick said martin indignantly id ought to have got two hundred it was worth it i wouldnt do what you did for a good deal more than two hundred dollars you havent told me what that business was that i could earn fifteen dollars a week at no said martin ive changed my mind about it if smiths goin to serve me such a mean trick i wont work for him no longer ill speak to him about it tomorrow martin relapsed into silence rufus had given him something to think about which disturbed him considerably though he had been disappointed in the contents of the box he had not for a moment doubted the good faith of his confederate and he was proportionately incensed now that the latter had appropriated seven dollars to his one considering that he had done all the work and incurred all the danger it did seem rather hard there was one bed in the room rather a narrow one im goin to bed said martin at length i guess the bedll be big enough for us both thank you said rufus who did not fancy the idea of sleeping with his stepfather if youll give me one of the pillows ill sleep on the floor just as you say but youll find it rather hard sleepin i shant mind this was the arrangement they adopted martin took off his coat and vest and threw himself on the bed he was soon asleep as his heavy breathing clearly indicated rufus stretched on the floor lay awake longer it occurred to him that he might easily take the key of the door from the pocket of martins vest which lay on the chair at his bedside and so let himself out of the room but even then it would be uncertain whether he could get out of the house and he would have to leave the tin box behind him this he hoped to get hold of through humpys assistance on the whole therefore it seemed best to wait a little longer chapter xxiii escape humpy made up his mind to accept our heros offer fifty dollars was to him a small fortune and he saw no reason why he should not earn it the brutal treatment he had received from smith removed all the objections he had at first felt now how was he going to fulfil his part of the compact to release rufus would be comparatively easy he happened to know that the key of his own room in the attic would also fit the door of the chamber in which our hero was confined the difficulty was to get possession of the tin box he did not even know where it was concealed and must trust to his own sagacity to find out to this end he watched his employer carefully whenever he got a chance to do so without being observed hoping he might take the box out from its place of concealment finally smith noticed the boys glances and said roughly what are you looking at boy do you think you shall know me the next time you see me humpy did not reply but this made him more careful in the morning he took up our heros breakfast meeting martin on his way downstairs well said rufus eagerly as he entered the room have you found out anything about the box not yet said humpy im tryin to find where hes hid it i can let you out any time how ive got a key that fits this lock thats well but id rather wait till i can carry the box with me ill do what i can said humpy im goin to watch him sharp id better go down now or maybe hell be suspectin something humpy went downstairs leaving rufus to eat his breakfast on his way down his attention was drawn by angry voices proceeding from the room in which he had left smith he comprehended at once that smith and martin were having a dispute about something he stood still and listened attentively and caught the following conversation the boy tells me said martin doggedly that there was four hundred dollars in the box you only gave me fifty then the boy lies said smith irritated i dont believe he does said martin i dont like him myself but he aint in the habit of telling lies perhaps you believe him sooner than you do me i dont see where the three hundred dollars went persisted martin considerin that i did all the work fifty dollars was very small for me you got half what there was if thered been more youd have got more why didnt you wait and open the box when i was there look here said smith menacingly if you think i cheated you you might as well say so right out i dont like beating around the bush the boy says there was four hundred dollars turner told him so then turner lies exclaimed smith who was the more angry because the charge was a true one the box is just as it was when i opened it ill bring it out and show you just where i found the money when humpy heard this his eyes sparkled with excitement and anticipation now if ever he would find out the whereabouts of the tin box luckily for him the door was just ajar and by standing on the upper part of the staircase he could manage to see into the room he saw smith go to a desk at the centre of one side of the room and open a drawer in it from this he drew out the box and opening it displayed the contents to martin there said he thats where i found the money there was a roll of ten tendollar bills i divided them into two equal parts and gave you your share i was disappointed myself for i expected more i didnt think youd suspect me of cheating you but i dont want any fuss ill give you ten dollars off my share and then you cant complain so saying he took out a ten from his pocketbook and handed it to martin are you satisfied now he asked i suppose i shall have to be said martin rather sullenly for he was by no means sure of the veracity of his confederate its all i can do for you at any rate said smith and now suppose we take breakfast i shall want you to go to newark today he replaced the box in the drawer and locking it put the key in his pocket by this time humpy thought it would do to reappear whereve you been all the time asked smith roughly the boy upstairs was talkin to me what did he say he asked what was your business what did you tell him i told him i didnt rightly know but i thought you was a manufacturer right humpy youre a smart boy laughed smith you know a thing or two the boy showed his teeth and appeared pleased with the compliment what else did he ask he asked would i let him out did he the young rascal and what did you tell him not for joe good for you theres a quarter and smith offered the boy twentyfive cents if hed done that yesterday instead of hittin me thought humpy i wouldnt have gone aginst him but the money came too late humpy had a brooding sense of wrong not easily removed and he had made up his mind to betray his employer the breakfast proceeded humpy waiting upon the table when the meal was over smith gave martin some instructions and the latter set out for newark which was to be the scene of his operations during the day about half an hour later smith said humpy ive got to go down town i may be gone all the forenoon stay in the house while i am gone and look out above all that that boy upstairs dont escape yes sir said humpy when smith left the coast was clear there were none in the house except rufus and the boy who was expected to stand guard over him the giant had gone to philadelphia on some business precisely what humpy did not understand and there was nothing to prevent his carrying out his plans he had two or three old keys in his pocket and with these he eagerly tried the lock of the drawer but none exactly fitted one was too large the other two were too small humpy decided what to do he left the house and went to a neighboring locksmith i want to get a key he said what size a little smaller than this i must know the exact size or i cant suit you what is it the key of a drawer i can go with you to the house that wont do said humpy ive lost the key and i dont want the boss to know it hed find out if you went to the house then ill tell you what you can do take an impression of the lock in wax ill give you some wax and show you how then ill make a key for you can you do it right off im in a great hurry yes my son ill attend to it right away he brought a piece of wax and showed humpy how to take an impression of a lock there said he laughing thats the first lesson in burglary humpy lost no time in hurrying back and following the locksmiths instructions he then returned to the shop how soon can i have the key in an hour im pretty sure ive got a key that will fit this impression with a little filing down come back in an hour and you shall have it humpy went back and seeing that there were some traces of wax on the lock he carefully washed them off with soap a little before the hour was up he reported himself at the locksmiths your key is all ready for you said the smith i guess it will answer how much is it twentyfive cents humpy paid the money and hurried to the house anxious to make his experiment the locksmiths assurance was verified the key did answer the drawer opened and the errandboys eyes sparkled with pleasure as they rested on the box he snatched it hastily relocked the drawer and went up the stairs two at a time he had the key of his attic room in his pocket with this he opened the door of the chamber and entering triumphantly displayed to rufus the tin box ive got it he ejaculated rufus sprang to his feet and hurried up to him youre a trump he said how did you get hold of it i havent time to tell you now we must be goin or mr smith may come back and stop us all right said rufus im ready the two boys ran downstairs and opening the front door made their egress into the street rufus with the tin box under his arm where will we go asked humpy are you going with me yes i want that money you shall have it you have fairly earned it and ill see that you get it if i have to pay it out of my own pocket i shant go back said humpy why not hell know i let you out hell murder me if i go back ill be your friend ill get you something to do said rufus will you said the hunchback brightening up yes i wont forget the service you have done me rufus had hardly got out these words when humpy clutched him violently by the arm and pulled him into a passageway the door of which was open to the street whats that for demanded rufus inclined to be angry humpy put his finger to his lip and pointed to the street on the opposite sidewalk rufus saw smith sauntering easily along with a cigar in his mouth chapter xxiv how rufus got back it happened that smith espied the man whom he wished to meet from the carwindow just as it turned into canal street he got out therefore and adjourning to a whiskey saloon the two discussed a matter of business in which they were jointly interested and then separated thus smith was enabled to return home sooner than he had anticipated he little suspected that his prisoner had escaped as he walked complacently by on the opposite sidewalk its lucky i saw him said humpy he might have nabbed us he wouldnt have nabbed me said rufus resolutely hed have found it hard work to get me back hes stronger than you said humpy doubtfully id have called a copp then said rufus using his old word for policeman hell kill me if he ever gets hold of me said humpy shuddering he horsewhipped me yesterday then hes a brute said rufus who could not help feeling a degree of sympathy for the deformed boy who had done him such good service he never did it before said humpy thats what made me turn against him and you wont go back to him never said humpy decidedly hell know i let you out whats your name asked rufus remembering that he had never heard the name of his guide they call me humpy said the deformed boy flushing a little he had got hardened to the name he thought but now that rufus asked him he answered with a feeling of shame and reluctance havent you another name i dont like to call you that my name is william norton but ive most forgot it its so long since anybody ever called me so then ill call you so i like it better than the other have you made up your mind what to do now youve left your old place yes im going out west to chicago maybe why do you leave new york i want to get away from him said william indicating his old employer by a backward jerk of his finger if i stay here hell get hold of me perhaps you are right but you neednt go so far as chicago philadelphia would do he goes there sometimes what will you do in chicago ill get along theres a good many things i can do black boots sell papers smash baggage and so on besides ill have some money the fifty dollars i am to give you ive got more besides said humpy lowering his voice looking around cautiously lest he might be observed he drew out the calico bag which contained his savings and showed to rufus theres twenty dollars in that he said jingling the coins with an air of satisfaction thatll make seventy when youve paid me im glad youve got so much william where did you get it all i saved it up he paid me fifty cents a week and gave me an extra quarter or so sometimes when he felt goodnatured i saved it all up and here it is when did you begin saving six months ago i used to spend all my money for oysters and cigars but somebody told me smokin would stop me from growin and i gave it up you did right i used to smoke sometimes but i stopped it dont do a boy any good are you rich asked humpy no what makes you ask you wear nice cloes besides you are goin to pay me fifty dollars im worth five hundred dollars said rufus with satisfaction thats a good deal said humpy enviously id feel rich if i had so much youll be worth a good deal more some time i hope i hope so but itll be a good while while this conversation had been going on the boys had been walking leisurely but rufus who was anxious to restore the tin box as soon as possible now proposed to ride well jump aboard the next car william he said ill pay the fare where are you goin to mr turners office to return the box he wont think i had anything to do with stealin it will he no ill take care he doesnt they jumped on board the next car and before long reached the termination of the car route at the junction of vesey street and broadway wheres the place youre goin to asked humpy in wall street well be there in ten minutes the boys proceeded down broadway and in rather less than ten minutes rufus followed by humpy entered his employers office his arrival created a sensation i am glad to see you back rufus said mr turner coming forward and shaking his hand cordially the clerks left their desks and greeted him in a friendly manner ive brought back the tin box mr turner said rufus i told you id get it back and i have he added with pardonable pride how did you recover it tell me all about it this boy helped me said rufus directing attention to humpy who had kept himself in the background but for him i should still be a prisoner closely confined and guarded he shall be rewarded said the banker what is his name william morton mr turner took the boys hand kindly dirty though it was and said i will bear you in mind my lad in a tone which made humpy who before felt awkward and uncertain of a welcome quite at his ease now for your story rufus said the banker i am curious to hear your adventures so you were a prisoner yes sir answered rufus and forthwith commenced a clear and straightforward account of his experiences which need not be repeated he wound up by saying that he had promised humpy fifty dollars in return for his assistance your promise shall be kept said mr turner i will pay you the money now if you wish he added turning to humpy i would advise you to put most of it in a savingsbank as you are liable to be robbed or to lose it ill put it in as soon as i get to chicago said humpy are you going there rufus explained why the boy wished to leave new york do you want to start at once id like to then rufus i think you had better go with him and buy his ticket you may also buy him a suit of clothes at my expense thank you sir said humpy gratefully if you can spare me mr turner said rufus i would like to go home first and let them know that i am safe certainly that reminds me that a lady was it your aunt was in the office an hour ago asking for you it was miss manning i promised to let you go home when you appeared and i think you had better do so at once to relieve the anxiety of your friends thank you sir and rufus was about to leave the office when a thought occurred to him and he turned back i didnt think to tell you that the money had been taken out he said so i supposed i will open the box the box being opened it was discovered also that the government bonds were missing thats too much to lose said the banker what is the number of the house in which you were confined rufus was able to give it having judged that it would be wanted i shall give information to the police and see what can be done towards recovering the bonds shall i go to the policeoffice for you mr turner no you can go home at once then accompany this boy to a clothingstore and afterwards to the erie railroad station where you may buy him a through ticket to chicago here is the necessary money and mr turner placed a roll of bills in the hands of our hero am i to buy the railroad ticket also out of this yes william shall have his fifty dollars clear to start on when he gets there miss manning had nearly got through with the morning lessons when a quick step was heard ascending the stairs two or three at a time rose let drop the arithmetic from which she had been reciting and exclaimed in glad excitement thats rufie i know it is the door opened and she was proved to be correct whereve you been rufie exclaimed his sister throwing her arms around his neck mr martin carried me off rosy i knew he would but you said you was too big he was smarter than i thought for sit down rosy and ill tell you all about it were you anxious about me miss manning yes rufus i dont mind saying now that i was though i would not confess it to rose who fretted enough for you without so the story had to be told again and was listened to i need not say with breathless interest you wont let him catch you again will you rufie said rose anxiously when it was finished not if i know myself rosy answered rufus that cant be done twice but ive got to be going ive got ever so much to do ill be back to dinner at six he hastened downstairs and rejoined humpy who had been waiting for him in the street chapter xxv unpleasant discoveries smith did not go home immediately he intended to do so but happened to think of an errand and this delayed him for an hour or two when he entered the house he looked around for his errandboy but looked in vain humpy he called out in a voice which could be heard all over the house there was no answer smith who was not remarkable for patience began to grow angry very likely the young rascal is in his room he said to himself ill stir him up he took the whip and ascended the stairs two or three at a time arrived in the attic he peered into humpys room but to his disappointment saw nobody the little villain got tired of waiting and went out thinking i couldnt find him out he muttered he shall have a taste of the whip when he comes back he went downstairs more slowly than he ascended he was considerably irritated and in a state that required an object to vent his anger upon under these circumstances his prisoner naturally occurred to him he had the proper key in his pocket and stopping on the second floor he opened the door of the chamber in which our hero had been confined his anger may be imagined when he found it untenanted it was not very dignified but smith began to stamp in his vexation and lash with his whip an unoffending chair in which rufus ought to have been seated i wish it was that young villain muttered smith scowling at the chair and lashing it harder id teach him to run away id make him howl smith was considerably discomposed things were going decidedly against him besides the escape of rufus might entail serious consequences if he should give information to the police about the place of his captivity a visit from these officials was an honor which smith felt disposed respectfully but firmly to decline unfortunately however policemen are not sensitive and are very apt to intrude where they are not wanted a visit to smiths abode might lead to unpleasant discoveries as he very well knew and he could not easily decide what course it would be best for him to pursue he inferred at once that humpy had been bought over and had released the prisoner otherwise he would undoubtedly have detected or frustrated our heros attempt to escape this did not inspire very amiable feelings towards humpy whom it would have yielded him great satisfaction to get into his power but humpy had disappeared and that satisfaction was not to be had mingled with smiths anger was a feeling of surprise humpy had been a good while in his employ and he had reposed entire confidence in his fidelity he might have continued to do so but for the brutal assault upon the boy recorded in a previous chapter he did not think of this however or guess the effect it had produced on the mind of the deformed errandboy i think i had better get out of the city a week or two till this blows over thought smith i guess ill take the afternoon train for philadelphia this was a wise resolution but smith made one mistake he ought to have put it into effect at once at that very moment information was lodged at the office of police which threatened serious consequences to him but of this he was ignorant he had no idea that rufus would act so promptly in spite of his anger smith was hungry his morning walk had given him an excellent appetite and he began to think about dinner as on account of the unlawful occupation in which he was engaged he did not think it prudent to employ a cook who might gossip about his affairs he generally devolved the task of preparing the dinner upon humpy whom he had taught to cook eggs broil beefsteak make coffee fry potatoes and perform other simple culinary duties now that humpy was gone he was obliged to do this work himself he looked into the pantry and found halfadozen eggs and a slice of steak these he proceeded to cook he had nearly finished his unaccustomed task when the door opened and martin returned with his nose a little redder than usual and his general appearance somewhat disordered by haste what brings you here so soon asked smith in surprise whats the matter i came near gettin nabbed thats whats the matter said martin how did that happen i went into a cigarstore near the ferry in jersey city said martin and asked for a couple of cigars twentycent ones i took em and handed in one of your tendollar bills the chap looked hard at it and then at me and said hed have to go out and get it changed i looked across the street and saw him goin to the policeoffice i thought id better leave and made for the ferry the boat was just goin when wed got a little ways out i saw the cigar man standin on the drop with a copp at his elbow youd better not go to jersey city again said smith i dont mean to said martin have you got enough dinner for me im as hungry as a dog yes theres dinner enough for two and thats all there is to eat it something significant in his employers tone struck martin theres the boy upstairs he said there isnt any boy upstairs you havent let him go queried martin staring openmouthed at the speaker no he got away while i was out this morning the more fool i for leaving him but there was humpy how did the boy get away without his seeing him humpys gone too you dont say ejaculated martin yes i do what you goin to do about it inquired martin hopelessly ill half kill either of the little rascals when i get hold of them said smith spitefully id give something out of my own pocket to get that undootiful son of mine back chimed in martin ill say this for him said smith hes a good sight smarter than his father i always was unlucky grumbled martin i aint been treated right if you had been youd be at sing sing returned smith amiably smith said martin with drunken dignity for he was somewhat under the influence of a liberal morning dram youd ought to respect the feelins of a gentleman wheres the gentleman i dont see him responded smith in a sarcastic tone if you aint too much of a gentleman to do your share of the work just draw out the table and put the cloth on this martin who was hungry did with equal alacrity and awkwardness showing the latter by overturning a pile of plates which fell with a fatal crash upon the floor just like your awkwardness you drunken brute exclaimed smith provoked martin did not reply but looked ruefully at the heap of broken crockery which he attributed like his other misfortunes to the illtreatment of the world and meekly got upon his knees and gathered up the pieces at length dinner was ready martin in spite of an ungrateful world ate with an appetite truly surprising so that his companion felt called upon to remonstrate i hope youll leave a little for me its just possible that i might like to eat a little something myself i didnt eat much breakfast said martin apologetically youd better lunch outside next time said his employer it will give you a good chance to change money ive tried it at several places said martin i could do it better if youd give me some smaller bills they dont like to change fives and tens after dinner was despatched and the table pushed back smith unfolded his plans to martin he suggested that it might be a little unsafe to remain at their present quarters for a week or fortnight to come and counselled martin to go to boston while he would go to philadelphia thats the way well dodge them he concluded just as you say said martin when do you want me back i will write you from philadelphia you can call at the postoffice for a letter in a few days when had i better sell the bond that reminds me said smith i will take the box with me he went and unlocked the drawer in which the box had been secreted to his dismay he discovered that it was gone have you taken the tin box he demanded turning upon martin with sudden suspicion isnt it there gasped martin no it isnt said smith sternly do you know anything about it i wish i may be killed if i do asserted martin then what can have become of it its my undootiful boy that took it im sure it is exclaimed martin with sudden conviction he had no key humpy got him one then just then smith espied on the floor some scraps of wax they told the story youre right he said with an oath weve been taken in worse than i thought the best thing we can do is to get away as soon as possible they made a few hurried preparations and left the house in company but they were too late a couple of officers who were waiting outside stepped up to them as they set foot on the sidewalk and said quietly you must come with us what for demanded smith inclined to show fight youd better come quietly you are charged with stealing a box containing valuables thats the man that did it said smith pointing to martin hes the one you want he put me up to it and shared the money retorted martin youre both wanted said the officer youll have a chance to tell your story hereafter as this winds up the connection of these two worthies with our story it may be added here that they were found guilty not only of the robbery but of manufacturing and disseminating counterfeit money and were sentenced to sing sing for a term of years the bonds were found upon them and restored to mr vanderpool thus the world persists in its illtreatment of our friend james martin still i cannot help thinking that if he had been a sober and industrious man he would have had much less occasion to complain chapter xxvi conclusion in the course of an hour humpy was provided with a new suit which considerably improved his appearance rufus accompanied him to the erie railway station where he purchased for him a through ticket to chicago and saw him enter the cars goodby william and good luck said rufus goodby said humpy youre a trump youre the first friend i ever had i hope i shant be the last said rufus shall i give your love to smith if i see him never mind about it rufus was compelled to leave the station before the cars started in order to hurry back to the office arrived there a new errand awaited him rufus said mr turner do you remember where mr vanderpool lives the owner of the tin box yes sir you may go up at once and let him know that his property is recovered this task rufus undertook with alacrity he had been pleased with what he saw of mr vanderpool on his first visit and was glad to be able to tell him that the box for whose loss he felt partly to blame was recovered he was soon ringing the bell of the house in twentyseventh street mr vanderpool was at home the servant told him and he was ushered immediately into his presence the old gentleman who had been writing laid aside his pen and looking up recognized rufus youre the boy that came to tell me about my property being stolen are you not he asked yes sir but its found bless my soul you dont say so did the thief give it up no said rufus i took it from him is it possible why youre only a boy said mr vanderpool regarding him with interest boys can do something as well as men said rufus with pardonable pride tell me all about it rufus told his story as briefly as possible when he described how he had been entrapped and imprisoned mr vanderpool said bless my soul several times youre a brave boy he said when the story was finished thank you sir said rufus modestly were you not afraid when you were locked up by those bad men not at all sir i should have been i dont think i am very brave youve behaved very well indeed master i dont remember your name rufus rushton master rushton i must make you a present i have only done my duty mr vanderpool i dont want any present for that well talk about that afterwards by the way have you thought anything more about the question whether the planets are inhabited i cant say i have sir ive had so much else to think about very true very true ive written a few pages more which i will read to you if you have time i should like very much to hear them sir but i am afraid i must hurry back to the office ah i am sorry for that said the old gentleman in a tone of disappointment but he brightened up immediately ill tell you what my young friend he said you shall come and dine with me next saturday at six and then we will have the evening to ourselves what do you say i shall be very happy to come sir said rufus not quite sure whether he would be happy or not when saturday came he presented himself and was very cordially received by the old gentleman the dinner was a capital one and served in excellent style mr vanderpool paid rufus as much attention as if he were a guest of distinction read him his essay on the planets and showed him some choice engravings the evening passed very agreeably and rufus was urged to come again he did so and so won the favor of the old gentleman that at the end of two months he was invited to come and make his home permanently in the house in twentyseventh street thank you mr vanderpool said our hero you are very kind but i shouldnt like to leave miss manning and my little sister have you a little sister tell me about her her name is rose and she is a dear little girl said rufus warmly how old is she eight years old i am glad she is not a young lady you can bring her too ive got plenty of room who is miss manning she is a friend of mine and teaches my sister why cant she come and look after my servants i have no housekeeper i will mention it to her said rufus rufus did mention it to miss manning who by appointment called upon the old gentleman mr vanderpool repeated the invitation and offered her ten dollars per week for her services such an offer was not to be rejected miss manning resigned her situation as governess to mrs colmans children greatly to that ladys disappointment and removed with rose to the house of mr vanderpool elegant chambers were assigned to all three and they found themselves living in fashionable style as neither had any board to pay rufus felt justified in dressing both rose and himself in a manner more befitting the style in which they now lived while miss manning also finding that she was expected to preside at the table felt called upon to follow their example it was such a change for all three that it seemed like a dream sometimes when they recalled the miserable attic in leonard street and the humble lodging near the north river rose was sent to school and had a musicteacher at home miss manning also having considerable time at her disposal took lessons in music and french and soon acquired very respectable proficiency in both the old gentleman so long accustomed to solitude seemed to renew his youth in the cheerful society he had gathered around him and came to look upon rufus and rose as his own children he was continually loading them with gifts and his kindness won their gratitude and affection he tried to induce rufus to give up his situation with the banker but our hero was of an independent turn and had too active a temperament to be content with doing nothing on the succeeding christmas he received from mr vanderpool a very costly gold watch which i need not say was very acceptable about six months after her entrance into the house miss manning was profoundly astonished by receiving from the old gentleman an offer of marriage i dont ask for romantic love my dear miss manning said mr vanderpool but i hope you will not find it hard to like me a little and ill try to make you happy i dont want to hurry you take a week to think of it miss manning did take a week to think of it she was not in love with mr vanderpool that was hardly to be expected as he was thirty years older than she but she did respect and esteem him and she knew that he would be kind to her so she said yes after consulting with rufus and one morning without any fuss or ostentation she was quietly married and transformed from plain miss manning into the rich mrs vanderpool i may say here that neither she nor her husband has seen cause to repent the match so unexpectedly brought about but live in harmony and mutual friendship as i hope they may continue to do to the end of their days when rufus reached the age of twentyone he was agreeably surprised by an offer from mr turner to take him into partnership but mr turner he said i have very little capital far too little for a partner in such a large business you have fifty thousand dollars that will answer very well i dont understand you sir said rufus suspecting that mr turner was crazy or was dreaming you remember the tin box which you recovered five years ago yes sir mr vanderpool has made it over with its contents to you as a free gift its value as you remember is fifty thousand dollars or rather more now some of the stocks having risen in value rufus was quite affected by this munificent gift and no longer objected to the plan proposed shortly after the style of the firm was changed and now as you pass through wall street if you will closely examine the signs on either side of the street your eyes may light on this one turner and rushton bankers you will have no trouble in conjecturing that the junior partner in this firm is the same who was first known to you as rough and ready if you think that our young friend the newsboy has had rare luck i hope you will also admit that by his honesty industry and generous protection of his little sister he has deserved the prosperity he has attained george black has long since bought out his partners interest in the periodical store and now carries on quite a flourishing trade in his own name smith and martin are still in prison their term of confinement not yet having expired what adventures yet remain in store for james martin i am unable to say but i doubt if he will ever turn over a new leaf his habits of indolence and intemperance are too confirmed to give much hope of amendment the fortunes of rough and ready so far as this record is concerned are now ended and with them is completed the sixth and concluding volume of the ragged dick series but the flattering interest which his young friends have taken in these pictures
