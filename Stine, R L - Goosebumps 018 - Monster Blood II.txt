evan ross backed into the corner of the den as he stared at his dog trigger the tan cocker spaniel lowered his head and stared back at evan with wet brown eyes the old dogs tail began to wag excitedly trigger evan cried angrily did you eat monster blood again the dogs tail began wagging faster trigger let out a low bark that rumbled like thunder evans back pressed against the darkpaneled den wall trigger took a few heavy steps toward him panting hard his huge pink tongue as big as a salami hung out of his enormous mouth did you evan demanded did you eat more monster blood the answer to evans question was obvious trigger had been normal cocker spaniel size that morning now the dog stared down at evan as big as a pony triggers furry paws the size of elephant hooves thudded on the den carpet his enormous tail pounded louder than a bass drum against the side of a leather couch evan covered his ears as trigger let out an excited highpitched bark that shook the den walls stay stay evan shouted the enormous dog panted hard his tail wagging furiously oh no evan thought in horror he wants to play sit evan screamed sit but trigger didnt know how to sit for ten years seventy dog years evan had tried to teach trigger to sit on command but trigger just didnt get it where did you find the monster blood evan demanded we all saw it disappear into thin air gone it was just gone you know that stuff makes you grow and grow and grow and grow where did you find it trigger tilted his big head at an angle as if trying to understand evans words then wagging his huge tail excitedly he started to run to evan no evan thought hes going to jump on me hes going to jump if he jumps hell crush me an enormous glob of drool escaped triggers open mouth and hit the carpet with a loud smack sit evan cried his voice choked with panic sit boy sit trigger hesitated staring down at evan to evans horror the dog was growing even bigger trigger was now as tall as a horse where did he find the container of monster blood evan wondered his back pressed against the wall where the dogs brown eyes gaped at evan like shimmering dark pools trigger uttered another deafening bark that shook the whole house yuck evan cried squeezing his nose with two fingers the dogs breath rushed at him like a strong wind and it smelled as sour as a dead mouse back get back trigger evan pleaded but trigger had never learned that command either without warning the giant dog leaped at evan down down evan shrieked triggers mouth gaped open the dogs huge tongue licked the side of evans face the tongue felt scratchy and hot evans carrotcolored hair was matted down with sticky dog saliva no please evan screamed im only twelve im too young to die he started to scream again but triggers big teeth clamped around his waist cutting off his breath trigger put me down put me down evan choked out the dogs wagging tail sent a lamp crashing to the floor the teeth held evan gently but firmly he felt himself being lifted off the floor put me down put me down why wouldnt the stupid dog listen evan thrashed his arms and legs frantically trying to squirm free but trigger held on tightly the dogs enormous paws pounded on the carpet he carried evan through the hall and across the kitchen then he lowered his head and butted the kitchen screen door open the door slammed hard behind them trigger began trotting over the grass bad dog bad dog evan cried his voice came out in a tiny squeak had trigger grown even bigger evan was at least three feet off the ground now put me down down he cried evan watched the green grass of the back yard bounce beneath him trigger was panting as he walked the panting sounds made evans whole body vibrate he realized his jeans and tshirt were soaked from dog saliva trigger doesnt mean to hurt me evan told himself hes just being playful thank goodness hes such an old dog his teeth arent very sharp the dog stopped at the edge of the flower garden in the back of the yard he lowered evan nearly to the ground but didnt let go his paws began to churn up the soft dirt let me down evan shrieked trigger listen to me breathing hard his hot sour breath pouring over evan the big dog continued to dig a wave of horror swept over evan as he realized what trigger was doing no evan shrieked dont bury me trigger the dog dug faster its front paws churning furiously the soft dirt flew past evans face im not a bone evan cried frantically trigger im not a bone dont bury me trigger please dont bury me dont bury me please dont bury me evan murmured he heard laughter he raised his head and glanced around and realized that he wasnt home in his back yard he was sitting in his assigned seat in the third row near the window in mr murphys science class and mr murphy was standing right at evans side his enormous round body blocking the sunlight from the window earth calling evan earth calling evan mr murphy called cupping his chubby pink hands over his mouth to make a megaphone the kids all laughed evan could feel his face growing hot ssorry he stammered you seem to have been somewhere in daydream land mr murphy said his tiny black eyes twinkling merrily yes evan replied solemnly i was dreaming about monster blood i i cant stop thinking about it ever since his frightening adventure the past summer with the green sticky stuff evan had been dreaming and daydreaming about it evan please mr murphy said softly he shook his round pink head and made a tsktsk sound monster blood is real evan blurted out angrily the kids laughed again mr murphys expression grew stern his tiny eyes locked onto evans evan i am a science teacher you dont expect a science teacher to believe that you found a can of sticky green gunk in a toy store that makes things grow and grow yyes i do evan insisted maybe a sciencefiction teacher would believe it mr murphy replied grinning at his own joke not a science teacher well youre dumb evan cried he didnt mean to say it he knew immediately that he had just made a major mistake he heard gasps all around the big classroom mr murphys pink face darkened until it looked like a red balloon but he didnt lose his temper he clasped his chubby hands over the big stomach of his green sportshirt and evan could see him silently counting to ten evan youre a new student here isnt that right he asked finally his face slowly returned to its normal pink color yes evan replied his voice just above a whisper my family just moved to atlanta this fall well perhaps youre not familiar with the way things work here perhaps at your old school the teachers liked it when you called them dumb perhaps you called your teachers ugly names all day long perhaps no sir evan interrupted lowering his head it just slipped out laughter rang through the classroom mr murphy glared sternly at evan his face twisted in an angry frown give me a break evan thought unhappily glancing quickly around the room evan saw a sea of grinning faces i think im in trouble again evan thought glumly why cant i keep my big mouth shut mr murphy glanced up at the wall clock school is nearly over he said why dont you do us all a little favor evan to make up for the time you made us waste today uh oh evan thought darkly here it comes when the bell rings go put your books away in your locker mr murphy instructed then come back here and clean cuddless cage evan groaned his eyes darted to the hamster cage against the wall cuddles was scratching around in wood shavings on the cage floor not the hamster evan thought unhappily evan hated cuddles and mr murphy knew it this was the third time mr murphy had made evan stay after school and clean out the gross disgusting cage perhaps while you clean the hamster cage mr murphy said returning to his desk you can think about how to do better in science class evan evan jumped to his feet i wont do it he cried he heard shocked gasps all around him i hate cuddles evan screamed i hate that stupid fat hamster as everyone stared in amazed horror evan ran over to the cage pulled open the door and grabbed cuddles up in one hand then with an easy graceful motion he flung the hamster across the room and out the open window evan knew he was having another daydream he didnt jump up screaming and throw the hamster out the window he only thought about it everyone thinks about doing crazy wild things once in a while but evan would never do anything that crazy instead he said okay mr murphy then he sat quietly in his seat staring out the window at the puffy white clouds in the bright blue sky he could see his own reflection staring back at him in the glass his curly carrotcolored hair looked darker in the reflection so did the freckles that dotted his cheeks his expression was mournful he hated being made fun of in front of the entire class why am i always getting myself into trouble he wondered why cant mr murphy ever give me a break didnt the teacher realize how hard it was to be the new kid in school how am i supposed to make new friends if murphy is always making me look like a total jerk in class bad enough that no one believed him about the monster blood evan had eagerly told the kids in his new school about it how he had stayed with his greataunt the past summer how he and a girl he met named andy had found the blue container of monster blood in a creepy old toy store and how the green yucky monster blood had started to grow and grow how it had bubbled out of its container outgrown a bucket outgrown a bath tub and just kept growing and growing as if it were alive and evan had told kids how trigger had eaten just a little of the monster blood and had grown nearly as big as a house it was such a frightening amazing story evan was sure his new friends would find it really cool but instead they just thought he was weird no one believed him they laughed at him and told him he had a sick imagination evan became known around his new school as the kid who made up stupid stories if only i could prove to them that the story is true evan often thought sadly if only i could show them the monster blood but the mysterious green gunk had vanished from sight before evan left his greataunts house not a trace of it had been left not a trace the bell rang everyone jumped up and headed for the door talking and laughing evan knew that a lot of his classmates were laughing at him ignoring them evan picked up his backpack and started to the door hurry back evan mr murphy called from behind his desk cuddles is waiting evan growled under his breath and stepped out into the crowded hallway if murphy loves that stupid hamster so much why doesnt he ever clean out the cage he wondered bitterly a group of kids laughed loudly as evan passed by were they laughing at him evan couldnt tell he started jogging to his locker when something hit his leg just above the ankle his feet flew out from under him and he toppled face down onto the hard tile floor hey evan cried angrily he stared up at a big toughlooking kid from his class named conan barber all the kids called him conan the barbarian for good reason conan was twelve but he looked about twenty years older he was taller and wider and stronger and meaner than any kid in the school he wasnt a badlooking guy evan grudgingly admitted he had wavy blond hair blue eyes and a handsome face he was very athleticlooking and played all the sports at school he was an okay guy evan thought wistfully except that he had one very bad habit conan loved to live up to his nickname he loved being conan the barbarian he loved strutting around pounding kids who werent his size which included everyone evan had not hit it off with conan he met conan on the playground a few weeks after moving to atlanta eager to make a good impression evan told him the whole monster blood story conan didnt like the story he stared back at evan with his cold blue eyes for a long long time then his expression hardened and he murmured through clenched teeth we dont like wise guys down here in atlanta he gave evan a pretty good pounding that day evan had tried to stay away from conan ever since but it wasnt easy now he gazed up at conan from his position on the floor hey whyd you trip me evan demanded shrilly conan grinned down at him and shrugged it was an accident evan tried to decide whether it was safer to stand up or to stay down on the floor if i stand up hell punch me he thought if i stay down here hell step on me tough choice he didnt get to make it conan reached down and with one hand pulled evan to his feet give me a break conan evan pleaded why cant you leave me alone conan shrugged again it was one of his favorite replies his blue eyes twinkled merrily youre right evan he said his grin fading i shouldnt have tripped you yeah evan agreed straightening his tshirt so you can pay me back conan offered huh evan gaped at him conan stuck out his massive chest go ahead hit me in the stomach ill let you whoa no way evan replied trying to back up he stumbled into a group of kids go ahead conan urged following after him hit me in the stomach as hard as you can its only fair evan studied his expression you really mean it conan nodded tightlipped he stuck out his chest as hard as you can go ahead i wont hit back i promise evan hesitated should he go ahead and do it i may never get a chance like this again he thought a lot of kids were watching evan realized if i hit him really hard if i hurt him if i make him cry out then maybe kids around here will have a little respect for me ill be evan the giant killer the guy who pounded conan the barbarian he balled his hand into a tight fist and raised it is that your fist conan cried laughing evan nodded oooh this is going to hurt conan cried sarcastically he made his knees tremble everyone laughed i may surprise him evan thought angrily go ahead as hard as you can conan urged he sucked in a deep breath and held it evan pulled his arm back and swung his fist as hard as he could the fist made a solid thud as it hit conans stomach it felt like hitting a concrete wall evans hand throbbed with pain hey a mans voice called angrily startled evan spun around to see mr murphy glaring at him no fighting mr murphy yelled at evan the teacher came bouncing up to them and stepped between the two boys huffing for breath he turned to conan why did evan hit you he demanded conan shrugged his blue eyes went wide and innocent i dont know mr murphy he replied in a tiny forlorn voice evan just walked up and hit me as hard as he could conan rubbed his stomach and uttered a short whimper ow he really hurt me mr murphy narrowed his beady black eyes at evan his chubby face turned bright red again evan i saw the whole thing i really dont understand you he said softly but mr murphy evan started the teacher raised a hand to silence him if you were angry about what happened in class mr murphy said you shouldnt take it out on other kids conan rubbed his stomach tenderly i hope evan didnt break anything he murmured do you want to see the nurse mr murphy asked conan shook his head evan could see he was having trouble keeping a straight face ill be okay he said and staggered away what a phony evan thought bitterly did conan know the whole time that murphy was standing there probably go take care of cuddles mr murphy told evan frowning and try to shape up evan im going to be watching you evan muttered a reply and trudged back into the classroom sunlight streamed in through the wall of windows a strong breeze made the window shade flap over the open window near the teachers desk feeling angry and upset his stomach churning evan made his way through the empty room to the hamster cage cuddles wrinkled his nose in greeting the hamster knew the routine by now evan gazed into the metal cage at the brownandwhite creature why do people think hamsters are cute he wondered because they wrinkle their noses because they run around and around on wheels like total jerks because of their cute little buck teeth cuddles stared up at him with his little black eyes he has mr murphys eyes evan thought chuckling to himself maybe thats why murphy likes him so much okay okay so youre kind of cute evan told the hamster but i know your secret youre just a big fat rat in disguise cuddles wrinkled his nose again in reply with a loud sigh evan went to work holding his breath because he hated the smell he pulled out the bottom tray youre a messy little guy he told the hamster when are you going to learn to clean up your own room still holding his breath he dumped out the old newspaper shavings and replaced them with fresh shavings from the box in the supply closet he returned the bottom tray to its place as cuddles watched with great interest then he poured fresh water into the water bottle how about some sunflower seeds evan asked he began to feel a little more cheerful knowing his job was almost finished he removed the seed cup from the cage and made his way across the room to the supply closet to get fresh sunflower seeds okay cuddles he called these look yummy he started to carry the seeds back to the cage halfway across the room evan stopped and uttered a startled gasp the cage door hung wide open the hamster was gone a choking sound escaped evans lips as he stared at the empty cage his eyes darted frantically around the room cuddles cuddles he called in a frightened voice why am i yelling he asked himself spinning around in a total panic the dumb hamster doesnt know its name he heard footsteps out in the hall mr murphy no please no evan pleaded silently dont let it be mr murphy dont let him return until i have cuddles safely back in his cage cuddles was mr murphys most precious possession he had told this to the class time and again evan knew that if anything happened to cuddles mr murphy would be on evans case for the rest of the year no for the rest of his life evan froze in the center of the room listening hard the footsteps passed by the room evan started breathing again cuddles where are you cuddles he called in a trembling voice i have some delicious sunflower seeds for you he spotted the furry brownandwhite creature on the chalk tray under the front chalkboard there you are i see you evan whispered tiptoeing toward it cuddles was busily chewing on something a small piece of white chalk evan tiptoed closer i have seeds for you cuddles he whispered much tastier than chalk cuddles held the stick of chalk in his front paws turning it as he chewed evan crept closer closer look seeds he held the plastic seed cup toward the hamster cuddles didnt look up evan crept up closer closer close enough to dive forward and miss the hamster dropped the chalk and scampered down the chalk tray evan made another frantic grab and came up with nothing but air letting out a frustrated groan evan saw the hamster dive to the floor and scamper behind mr murphys desk the hamsters feet skidded and slid on the linoleum floor its toenails clicking loudly you cant get away youre too fat evan cried he dropped to his knees and peered under the desk he could see cuddles staring back at him from the darkness the animal was breathing rapidly its sides swelling with each breath dont be scared evan whispered soothingly im going to put you back in your nice safe cage he crawled quickly to the desk the hamster stared back at him breathing hard it didnt move until evan reached for him then cuddles scampered away his tiny paws sliding on the floor evan jumped angrily to his feet cuddles whats your problem he demanded loudly this isnt a stupid game it wasnt a game at all evan knew if he didnt get the hamster back in the cage mr murphy would flunk him for sure or suspend him from school or get his family kicked out of atlanta calm down evan urged himself dont panic he took a deep breath and held it then he saw the hamster on the window ledge just inside the open window okay evan go ahead and panic he told himself this was definitely panic time he tried to call to the hamster but his voice came out a choked whisper swallowing hard evan edged slowly toward the window ledge come here cuddles he whispered please cuddles come here closer closer almost close enough to reach the hamster almost close enough dont move cuddles dont move he reached out his hand slowly slowly cuddles glanced back at him with his soft black eyes then the hamster jumped out the window evan hung back for only a second then he jumped out the window after the hamster luckily the science classroom was on the ground floor evan landed face down in a low evergreen hedge struggling and squirming it took him a while to climb to his feet he took several steps over the grass then turned and stared back along the bottom of the long hedge cuddles are you under there evan squatted down to get a better view the hedge stretched the entire length of the school building cuddles could hide under there forever and if i dont find him evan told himself bitterly id better hide under there forever too to the right evan could hear voices from the playground happy shouting voices carefree voices still squatting he turned toward the happy voices and saw a fat brown ball wobbling over the grass toward the playground no not a ball cuddles that fat hamster isnt getting away this time evan decided jumping up and starting to chase after the creature ill catch him if i have to sit on him a picture flashed into evans mind of cuddles fiat as a pancake after evan had sat upon him a little round furry hamster rug despite his panic the thought of cuddles as a rug brought a smile to evans perspiring face as he ran he kept his eyes on cuddles the hamster was wobbling rapidly over the grass toward the playground oh no evan cried out in horror as cuddles darted in front of two girls speeding across the grass on bikes laughing together they didnt even see the hamster cuddles is about to be road kill evan thought shrinking back he shut his eyes and waited for the squish but the bikes rolled smoothly on and when they had passed evan spotted cuddles continuing his journey to the playground unharmed cuddles come back here he shouted furiously the hamster appeared to speed up he tumbled onto the baseball diamond all four paws scurrying over the dirt of the thirdbase line several kids stopped their game to stare stop him grab the hamster evan shouted desperately but the kids only laughed know how to catch him a joker named robbie greene called to evan make a sound like a sunflower seed thats an old joke a girl called to robbie thanks for your help evan shouted sarcastically he ran over the pitching mound and had crossed second base when he realized he had lost sight of cuddles he stopped and spun around his heart thudding wildly in his chest he searched the grass of the infield where where is he he stammered do you see him but the kids had returned to their softball game i cant lose him now evan told himself choked with panic i cant sweat poured down evans forehead he mopped it with one hand brushing back his curly red hair his tshirt clung wetly to his back his mouth felt dry as cotton jogging into the outfield he searched the grass cuddles no sign of him a round brownish lump in the grass turned out to be someones baseball glove cuddles a kickball game was underway on the opposite diamond kids were shouting and cheering evan saw bree douglas a girl from his class slide hard into second base just before the ball has has anyone seen cuddles evan gasped trotting onto the diamond kids turned to gawk at him out here bree called brushing off the knees of her jeans evan did you take the hamster out for a walk everyone laughed scornful laughter he he got away evan replied panting is this what youre looking for a familiar voice called evan turned to see conan barber a pleased smile on his handsome face his blue eyes gleaming gripping it by its furry back conan held the hamster up in one hand cuddless four legs scurried in midair you you caught him evan cried gratefully he let out a long sigh of relief he jumped out the window evan reached out both hands for the hamster but conan jerked cuddles out of his reach prove its yours conan said grinning huh can you identify it conan demanded his eyes burning into evans challenging evan prove this hamster is yours evan swallowed hard and glanced around kids from the kickball game were huddling near they were all grinning delighted with conans mean joke evan sighed wearily and reached again for the hamster but conan was at least a foot taller than evan he lifted the hamster high above evans head out of evans reach prove its yours he repeated flashing the others a grin give me a break conan evan pleaded ive been chasing this stupid hamster for hours i just want to get him back in his cage before mr murphy do you have a license for him conan demanded still holding the squirming hamster above evans head show me the license evan jumped and stretched both hands up trying to grab cuddles away but conan was too fast for him he dodged away evan grabbed air some kids laughed give him the hamster conan bree called she hadnt moved from second base conans cold blue eyes sparkled excitedly ill tell you how you can get the hamster back he told evan huh evan glared at him he was getting really tired of conans game heres how to get old cuddles back conan continued holding the hamster tightly against his chest in one hand and petting its back with the other sing a song for it hey no way evan snapped give it to me conan evan could feel his face growing even hotter his knees started to tremble he hoped no one could see it sing row row row your boat and ill give you cuddles promise conan said smirking some kids laughed they moved closer eager to see what evan would do evan shook his head no way come on conan urged softly stroking the hamsters brown fur row row row your boat just a few choruses you know how it goes dont you more cruel laughter from the others conans grin grew wider come on evan you like to sing dont you no i hate singing evan muttered his eyes on cuddles hey dont be modest conan insisted ill bet youre a great singer are you a soprano or an alto loud laughter evans hands tightened into hard fists at his sides he wanted to punch conan and punch him and punch him he wanted to wipe the grin off conans handsome face with his fists but he remembered what it had felt like to punch conan it had felt like hitting the side of a truck he took a deep breath if i sing the stupid song will you really give me back the hamster conan didnt reply evan suddenly realized that conan wasnt looking at him anymore no one was they had all raised their eyes over evans shoulder confused evan spun around to face mr murphy what is going on here the teacher demanded his tiny black eyes moving from evan to conan then back to evan before evan could reply conan held up the hamster heres cuddles mr murphy conan said evan let him get away but i rescued cuddles just as he was going to get run over mr murphy let out a horrified gasp run over he cried cuddles run over the teacher reached out his chubby pink hands and took the hamster from conan he held the hamster against his bulging shirt and petted it making soothing sounds to it thank you conan mr murphy said after calming cuddles he glared at evan im very disappointed in you evan evan started to defend himself but mr murphy raised a hand to silence him well talk about it tomorrow right now i must get poor cuddles back into his cage evan slumped to the ground he watched mr murphy carry the hamster back to the school building mr murphy waddles just like the hamster evan realized normally that thought would have cheered him up but evan was far too unhappy to be cheered up by anything conan had embarrassed him in front of all the others and the big grinning hulk had managed to get evan in trouble with mr murphy twice in one afternoon the kickball game had started up again evan climbed slowly to his feet and began trudging to the school building to get his backpack he couldnt decide who he hated more cuddles or conan he had a sudden picture of cuddles stuffed inside a muffin tin being baked in an oven even that lovely thought didnt cheer evan up he pulled his backpack out of the locker and slung it over his shoulder then he slammed the locker shut the sound clanging down the empty hallway he pushed open the front door and headed for home walking slowly lost in his unhappy thoughts what a horrible day he told himself at least nothing worse could happen to me today he had just crossed the street and was making his way on the sidewalk in front of a tall hedge when someone leaped out at him grabbed his shoulders hard from behind and pulled him roughly to the ground evan let out a frightened cry and gazed into his attackers face you he cried heres a little advice evan andy said grinning down at him dont go out for the wrestling team andy evan cried staring up at her in surprise what are you doing here she reached out both hands and helped tug him to his feet then she tossed back her short brown hair with a flick of her head her brown eyes flashed excitedly didnt you read any of my letters she demanded evan had met andy the past summer when hed stayed with his greataunt for a few weeks he and andy had become good friends she was with him when he bought the container of monster blood she shared the whole frightening monster blood adventure with him evan liked andy because she was funny and fearless and kind of crazy he never could predict what she would do next she didnt even dress like other girls evan knew andy loved bright colors right now she was wearing a sleeveless magenta tshirt over bright yellow shorts which matched her yellow sneakers i told you in my last letter that my parents were sent overseas for a year andy said giving evan a playful shove i told you they were sending me to atlanta to live with my aunt and uncle i told you id be living just three blocks away from you i know i know evan replied rolling his eyes i just didnt expect to see you jump out of the hedge at me why not andy demanded her dark eyes exploring his evan didnt know how to answer that question glad to see me andy asked no he joked she pulled up a thick blade of grass and stuck it in the corner of her mouth they began walking toward evans house im starting at your school on monday she told him chewing on the blade of grass thrills and chills he replied snickering she shoved him off the sidewalk i thought people were supposed to be polite in the south im new here evan replied hows trigger she asked kicking a pebble across the sidewalk good evan told her like to talk a lot she asked sarcastically im in a bad mood he confessed it hasnt been the greatest day it couldnt be as bad as the day the monster blood went berserk andy exclaimed evan groaned dont mention monster blood to me please she studied him her expression turned serious whats wrong evan you look really upset she said dont you like it here he shook his head not much as they walked he told her about all the trouble he was having in his new school he told her about mr murphy and cuddles and how the teacher was always on his case and he told her about conan the barbarian and how conan was always picking on him always getting him into trouble always playing tricks on him and making him look bad and no one will believe me about the monster blood evan added they were standing at the bottom of his driveway they glanced up at evans new house a twostory red brick house with a sloping red tile roof the late afternoon sun dipped behind a large puff of cloud and a broad shadow rolled across the lawn andys mouth dropped open the blade of grass fell out you told kids about the monster blood she asked in surprise evan nodded yeah why not its a cool story isnt it and you expected kids to believe you andy cried slapping her forehead didnt they just think you were weird yeah evan replied bitterly they all think im weird andy laughed well you are weird thanks a bunch annnndrea evan muttered he knew she hated to be called by her real name dont call me andrea she replied sharply she raised a fist ill pound you annnnnndrea he repeated he ducked away as she swung her fist you punch like a girl he exclaimed youll bleed like a boy she threatened laughing he stopped he suddenly had an idea hey you can tell everyone im not weird huh why would i do that andy demanded no really evan said excitedly you can tell everyone at school that the monster blood was real that you were there that you saw it andys expression suddenly changed her dark eyes lit up and a sly grin crossed her face i can do better than that she said mysteriously evan grabbed her shoulder huh what do you mean what do you mean you can do better youll see she replied teasing him i brought something with me what what is it what do you mean evan demanded meet me tomorrow after school she told him at that little park over there she pointed to the next block a narrow park only a few blocks long ran along the bank of a shallow creek but what is it evan cried she laughed i love torturing you she declared but its a little too easy then she turned and headed down the street running at full speed andy wait evan called what have you got what did you bring she didnt even turn around evan dreamed about monster blood that night he dreamed about it nearly every night tonight he dreamed that his dad had eaten a glob of it now mr ross wanted to go to his office but he had grown too big to fit through the door youre in trouble now evan mr ross bellowed making the whole house shake big trouble big trouble the words stuck in evans mind as he sat up in bed and tried to shake away the dream the curtains flapped silently in front of his open bedroom window pale yellow stars dotted the charcoal sky staring hard evan could see the big dipper or was it the little dipper he never could remember shutting his eyes and settling back on the pillow evan thought about andy he was glad she had come to stay in atlanta for a while she could be a real pain but she was also a lot of fun what did she want to show him in the park after school probably nothing evan guessed it was probably just a dumb joke andy loved dumb jokes how can i get her to tell the kids at school about monster blood he wondered how can i get andy to tell everyone that i didnt make it up that its true he was still thinking about this problem as he fell back into a restless sleep the next day at school wasnt much better than the last somehow during free reading period conan had crept under the table and tied evans sneaker laces together when evan got up to go to the water fountain he fell fiat on his face he scraped a knee but no one cared the kids laughed for hours evans mommy tied his shoes funny this morning conan told everyone and they laughed even harder in science class mr murphy called evan over to the hamster cage look at poor cuddles the teacher said shaking his round head solemnly evan peered down into the metal cage cuddles was curled up in a corner under a pile of shavings the hamster was trembling and breathing in short gasps poor cuddles has been like that ever since yesterday mr murphy told evan with an accusing frown cuddles is sick because of your carelessness i im sorry evan stammered he stared hard at the quivering hamster youre faking arent you cuddles evan thought youre faking just to get me in trouble the hamster twitched and stared up at him with mournful black eyes when evan sat back down in his seat he felt cold water seep through the back of his jeans with a startled cry he jumped right back up someone probably conan had poured a cup of water on his chair that had the class laughing for at least ten minutes they stopped only when mr murphy threatened to keep everyone after school sit down evan the teacher ordered but mr murphy evan started sit down now mr murphy insisted evan dropped back down into the wet chair what choice did he have andy was waiting for evan by the trickling brown creek that rolled through the tiny park the old sassafras trees bent and whispered in a hot breeze a tall georgia pine leaned over the water as if trying to reach across the creek andy was wearing a bright blue tshirt over limegreen shortshorts she had been staring at her reflection in the muddy creek water she spun around smiling as evan called to her hey hows it going he called he stepped up beside her and dropped his backpack to the ground how was school andy asked same as always evan replied sighing then his expression brightened what did you bring he asked eagerly youll see she clasped a hand over his eyes shut your eyes evan and dont open them until i say he obediently shut his eyes but when she pulled her hand away he opened them a tiny crack just enough to see he watched her go behind the pine tree and pick up a small brown paper bag she carried the bag over to him youre peeking arent you she accused him maybe he confessed grinning she punched him playfully in the stomach he cried out and his eyes shot open whats in the bag grinning andy handed the bag to him he pulled it open peered inside and his mouth dropped open in shock the familiar blue can about the size of a can of soup andy you you evan stammered still staring wideeyed into the bag he reached in and pulled out the plastic can he read the faded label monster blood then he read the words in tiny type below it surprising miracle substance i saved it andy said beaming proudly evan couldnt get over his shock you brought monster blood i dont believe it you brought monster blood no she shook her head its empty evan the can is empty his face fell he sighed in total disappointment but you can show the can to everyone andy insisted that will prove you didnt make it up it will prove that monster blood really exists evan sighed again what good is an empty can he groaned he pulled off the top peered inside and screamed with a trembling hand evan tilted the can so that andy could see inside oh no she shrieked pulling her hands to her cheeks the can was half full inside a green glob of gooey monster blood shimmered in the sunlight like lime jello but it was empty andy protested staring into the can i know it was evan shook the can the green glob inside quivered there must have been a tiny speck in there evan guessed down at the bottom of the can and now its growing and growing again great andy declared she slapped him on the back so hard he nearly dropped the blue can great whats so great he demanded shakily now you can show this to the kids at your school she replied now theyll have to believe you i guess evan replied in a low voice oh i have a better idea she exclaimed her dark eyes lighting up mischievously uhoh evan moaned slip a little glob of it in that guy conans lunch tomorrow when he starts to grow as big as a hippo everyone will see that the monster blood is real no way evan cried he cupped the blue can in both hands as if protecting it from andy conan is already big enough he told her taking a step back i dont want him to grow another inch do you know what he could do to me if he became a giant andy laughed and shrugged it was just an idea a bad idea evan said sharply a really bad idea youre no fun she teased she leaped forward and tried to wrestle the can from his hands he spun around turning his back to her and hunched over protecting the can give it to me she cried laughing she started tickling his sides give it give it no he protested breaking free he ran to the safety of a tall evergreen shrub its mine andy declared coming after him hands at her waist if youre not going to use it hand it back evan stood his ground his expression turned serious andy dont you remember he demanded shrilly dont you remember how scary this stuff was dont you remember how dangerous it was all the trouble it caused so she replied her eyes on the blue can we have to get rid of it evan told her firmly we cant let it out of the can it will grow and grow and never stop but i thought you wanted to show it to the kids to prove that its real no evan interrupted i changed my mind this stuff is too dangerous we have to get rid of it he locked his eyes on hers his features tight with fear andy ive had nightmares every night because of this stuff i dont want any new nightmares okay okay she muttered she kicked at an upraised tree root then she handed him the brown paper bag evan clicked the top back on the can of monster blood then he shoved the can into the bag now how do we get rid of it he wondered out loud i know dump it in the creek andy suggested evan shook his head no good what if it gets out and pollutes the creek this creek is already polluted andy exclaimed its just a big mud puddle it isnt deep enough evan insisted someone will find the can and pull it out we cant take a chance then how do we get rid of it andy asked twisting her face in concentration hmmmm we could eat it ourselves that would get rid of it very funny evan muttered rolling his eyes just trying to be helpful andy said youre about as helpful as a toothache evan shot back haha remind me to laugh at that sometime she replied sticking her tongue out at him how can we get rid of it evan repeated gripping the bag in both hands how i know a boys voice called startling them both conan barber stepped out from behind a tall shrub you can give it to me he declared he reached out a big powerfullooking hand to grab the bag evan swung the paper bag behind his back conan lumbered toward them over the tall grass his eyes were narrowed menacingly at evan how long has he been hiding there evan wondered did he hear us talk about the monster blood is that why he wants the bag hi im andy andy chirped brightly she stepped in between the two boys and flashed conan a smile andy is a boys name conan said making a disgusted face he turned his hard stare on her challenging her and what kind of a name is conan andy shot back returning his stare you know me conan asked sounding surprised youre famous andy replied dryly conan suddenly remembered evan he stuck out his big paw ill take the bag now why should i give it to you evan demanded trying to keep his voice calm and steady because its mine conan lied i dropped it here you dropped an empty bag here evan asked conan swatted a fly from his blond hair it isnt empty i saw you put something in it hand it over now well okay evan handed him the paper bag conan eagerly reached inside his hand came out empty he peered inside the bag empty he stared hard at andy then at evan i told you it was empty evan said guess i made a mistake conan muttered hey no hard feelings shake conan reached out his big right hand to evan evan reluctantly stuck out his hand conan slid his hand over evans and began to tighten his grip harder harder evans fingers cracked so loudly they sounded hike a tree falling conan squeezed evans hand harder and harder until evan screamed in pain when conan finally let go the hand looked like a slab of raw hamburger nice handshake you got there conan exclaimed grinning he snapped his finger against andys nose then headed off quickly toward the street taking long strides laughing to himself great guy andy muttered rubbing her nose evan blew on his hand as if trying to put out a fire maybe i can learn to be lefthanded he murmured hey wheres the monster blood andy demanded i i dropped it evan replied still examining his hand huh she kicked away a clump of weeds and stepped over to him i thought i could shove the can into my back jeans pocket while conan was talking to you evan explained but it slipped out of my hand i dropped it he turned bent over and picked it up from the tall grass good thing it didnt roll or anything conan would have seen it he wouldnt know what to do with it if he had it andy said what are we going to do with it evan demanded its already caused us trouble weve got to hide it or throw it away or or he pulled open the lid oh wow look he held the can up to andys face the green goo had grown nearly to the top of the can its starting to grow a lot faster i guess because we exposed it to the air evan slammed the lid on tight lets bury it andy suggested here right under this tree well dig a deep hole and bury it evan liked the idea it was simple and quick they squatted down and began digging with their hands the dirt beneath the tree was soft the hole grew deep before they had worked up a sweat evan dropped the blue can of monster blood into the hole then they quickly covered it with dirt smoothing it out until it was impossible to tell a hole had been dug this was a good plan andy said climbing to her feet playfully wiping the dirt off her hands on the back of evans tshirt if we need it well know where it is evans red hair was matted to his forehead with sweat he had a wide smear of dirt across his freckled forehead huh why would we need it he demanded andy shrugged you never know we wont need it evan told her firmly we wont he was very very wrong hey dad whats up evan stepped into the garage mr boss stopped hammering and turned around he smiled at evan want to see my newest work yeah sure evan replied every weekend his father spent hour after hour in his garage workshop banging away on large sheets of metal making what he called his works he chiseled and hammered and sawed and put a lot of effort into his sculptures but to evan they all looked like bangedup sheets of metal when they were finished mr ross took a few steps back to admire his current project he lowered his heavy mallet in one hand and pointed with the chisel he held in his other hand i used brass for this one he told evan i call it autumn leaf evan studied it thoughtfully it looks like a leaf he lied it looks like dad ruined a perfectly good piece of brass he thought trying to keep a straight face its not supposed to look like a leaf mr ross corrected evan its supposed to look like my impression of a leaf oh evan scratched his curly red hair as he studied it some more neat dad he said i see what you mean then something else caught his eye hey whats this evan carefully stepped over several jagged bent shards of metal he made his way to another metal sculpture and ran his hand over the smooth shiny surface it was an enormous aluminum cylinder that rested above a flat wooden base go ahead spin it mr ross instructed smiling proudly evan pushed the cylinder with both hands it spun slowly over the wooden base i call it the wheel his father told him evan laughed thats cool dad you invented the wheel dont laugh mr ross replied grinning that sculpture was accepted at the annual arts competition at your school i have to take it to the auditorium later this week evan gave the wheel another spin ill bet no one else made a wheel that really spins he told his father you cant lose with this dad he teased sarcasm is the lowest form of humor mr ross muttered with a frown evan said goodbye and made his way out of the garage stepping carefully over the jagged pieces of brass and tin as he headed to the house he could hear the clang clang clang as his dad hammered away on his impression of a leaf in the halls after school on monday evan hurried around a corner and bumped right into andy i cant talk now he told her breathlessly im late for basketball tryouts he glanced down the long hall it was nearly empty the gym door opened and he could hear the thump of basketballs against the floor how come youre late andy demanded blocking his path murphy kept me after class evan told her with a groan he put me on permanent hamster duty i have to take care of cuddles every afternoon for the rest of my life bad news andy murmured no thats the good news evan replied bitterly whats the bad news the bad news is that mr murphy is also the basketball coach well good luck she said hope you make the team evan ran past her his heart pounding mr murphy is such a rat he thought unhappily hell probably keep me off the team because im late to practice even though its his fault im late evan took a deep breath no stop thinking like that he scolded himself think positive ive got to think positive sure im not as tall as the other guys maybe im not as big or as strong but im a good basketball player and i can make this team i can make this team i know i can having finished his pep talk to himself evan pulled open the double gym doors and stepped into the huge brightly lit gym think fast a voice called evan felt his face explode with pain then everything went black when evan opened his eyes he found himself staring up at about twenty guys and mr murphy he was stretched out flat on his back on the gym floor his face still hurt a lot he reached a hand up and touched his nose to his dismay it felt like a wilted leaf of lettuce you okay evan mr murphy asked quietly as the teacher leaned over evan the whistle that was on a string around his neck bumped against evans chest did my face explode evan asked weakly some of the guys snickered mr murphy glowered at them angrily then he turned back to evan conan hit you in the face with the basketball he reported hes got bad reflexes coach evan heard conan say from somewhere above him he shouldve caught the ball i really thought hed catch it but hes got bad reflexes i saw the whole thing conans friend a huge hulk of a kid named biggie malick chimed hi it wasnt conans fault evan shouldve caught the ball it was a perfect pass perfect evan thought with a sigh he touched his nose again this time it felt like a lump of mashed potatoes at least it isnt broken he thought glumly evans basketball tryout went downhill from there mr murphy helped him to his feet you sure you want to try out he asked thanks for the support evan thought bitterly i think i can make the team he said but conan biggie and the other guys had other ideas during the ballhandling tryout evan confidently began dribbling across the floor halfway to the basket biggie bumped him hard and conan stole the ball away they blocked evans shots they stole his passes they bumped him every time he moved sending him sprawling to the hardwood floor again and again a fast pass from conan caught evan in the mouth oops sorry conan yelled biggie laughed like a hyena defense i want to see defense mr murphy shouted from the sidelines evan lowered himself into a defensive stance as conan dribbled the ball toward him evan prepared to defend the basket conan drove closer closer evan raised both hands to block conans shot but to evans surprise conan let the ball bounce away in one swift motion he grabbed evan by the waist leaped high in the air and stuffed evan into the basket three points conan shouted in triumph biggie and the other guys rushed to congratulate conan laughing and cheering mr murphy had to get a stepladder to help evan down his hand on evans shoulder the teacher led him to the side youre just not tall enough evan he said rubbing his pink chins dont take it personally maybe youll grow but for now youre just not tall enough evan didnt say a word he lowered his head and sadly slumped out of the gym conan came running up to him at the door hey evan no hard feelings he said he stuck out his big sweaty hand shake evan held up his hand to show andy it looks like a wilted petunia she said i cant believe i fell for conans stupid handshake trick twice evan wailed it was the next afternoon evan and andy had walked from school to the small park near their houses evan had complained about mr murphy and conan and the other basketball players the whole way the late afternoon sun beamed down on them as they walked andy stopped to watch two monarch butterflies their blackandgold wings fluttering majestically as they hovered over a patch of blue and yellow wildflowers along the creekbed even the trickling brown creek looked pretty on this bright day tiny white gnats sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight over the shimmering water evan kicked at a fallen tree branch everything looked dark to him today dark and ugly it just wasnt fair he grumbled kicking the branch again it wasnt a fair tryout mr murphy should have given me a better chance andy tsktsked her eyes on the sparkling creek someone should teach mr murphy a lesson evan said i wish i could think of some way of paying him back i really do andy turned to him a devilish grin crossed her face i have a plan she said softly a really neat plan what is it evan demanded whats your idea evan demanded again andy grinned at him she was wearing a long limegreen tshirt over a dayglo orange tshirt pulled down over baggy blue shorts the sunlight made all the colors so bright evan felt like shielding his eyes you might not like it andy said coyly try me evan replied come on dont keep me in suspense well her eyes wandered over to the tree where they had buried the monster blood it has to do with the monster blood she said reluctantly he swallowed hard thats okay go on well its a pretty simple plan first we dig up the monster blood andy said watching his reaction yeah then we take some to school she continued yeah then we feed it to cuddles evans mouth dropped open just a little bit andy quickly explained we feed cuddles a tiny glob of it just enough to make him the size of a dog evan laughed it was a terrible idea a truly evil idea but he loved it he slapped andy on the back youre bad andy he cried youre really bad andy grinned proudly i know evan laughed again can you see the look on murphys face when he comes in and sees his precious little hamster has grown as big as a cocker spaniel what a riot so youll do it andy asked evans smile faded i guess he replied thoughtfully if you promise well only use a tiny bit and well bury the rest right away promise andy said just enough to play our little joke on mr murphy then well never use the stuff again okay evan agreed they shook hands solemnly then they hurried to the tree evan searched the entire park squinting against the bright sunlight he wanted to make sure no one was spying on them this time when he was sure the park was empty he and andy dropped to their knees under the tree and began scooping the dirt off the hole with their hands they had dug nearly two feet down when they realized the hole was empty the monster blood evan cried it its gone we must be digging under the wrong tree evan said sweat pouring down his freckled forehead andy pushed a wet strand of brown hair off her face with a dirtcovered finger no way she shook her head this is the right tree and the right hole then where is the monster blood evan demanded shrilly they both came up with the answer to his question at the same time conan he must have watched us bury it evan said his eyes darting around the park as if he expected to see conan jump out from behind a bush i thought he hurried away awfully fast that afternoon he knew the paper bag wasnt empty andy agreed he hid and watched us bury it then he waited till we were gone and dug it up they both stared into the empty hole in horrified silence andy broke the silence what is conan going to do with it she asked her voice just above a whisper probably eat it so he can grow bigger and pound me harder evan replied bitterly but he doesnt know what monster blood does andy said he doesnt know how dangerous it is of course he does i told him all about it evan replied he slammed his hand against the tree trunk we have to get it back before science class the next afternoon evan found conan in the hall he and biggie were standing next to evans locker they were laughing loudly about something slapping each other highfives conan wore a tight blue muscle shirt and baggy faded denim jeans with enormous holes at the knees biggie had wavy brown hair down to his shoulders he wore a sleeveless white tshirt and tightfitting black denims they look like a couple of tagteam wrestlers evan thought as he stepped between them hey look its air evan conan joked king of the slam dunk he and biggie guffawed loudly conan gave evan a slap on the back that sent him sprawling into biggie uh conan did you find something in the park evan asked struggling to regain his balance conan narrowed his eyes at evan and didnt reply did you find something that belongs to andy and me evan repeated you mean like your brains conan exclaimed he and his tagteam partner roared with laughter over that gem why dont we dribble him to class biggie asked conan coach murphy would like to see us get in some extra practice conan laughed gleefully at that idea haha very funny evan said sarcastically look conan that stuff you took its really dangerous you have to give it back conan opened his eyes in wideeyed innocence i really dont know what youre talking about evan did you lose something you know i lost something evan replied sharply and i want it back conan flashed a sly grin at biggie then he turned back to evan his expression hardening i dont know what you mean evan he said really i dont know what you and that girl lost but tell you what im a nice guy ill help you look for it he grabbed evan around the waist with both hands biggie pulled evans locker door open ill help you look for it in your locker conan said he shoved evan inside the locker and slammed the door shut evan started pounding on the metal door shouting for help but the bell had rung evan knew the hall was empty there was no one to hear his cries he decided to try fiddling with the latch but it was too dark to see anything and he was so jammed in he couldnt raise his arms finally two girls happened to walk by and they pulled open the locker door evan came bursting out redfaced gasping for air the girls laughter followed him all the way to mr murphys class youre late the teacher said sternly glancing up at the wall clock as evan staggered in evan tried to explain why but all that escaped his lips was a whistling wheeze im really tired of you disrupting my class evan mr murphy said rubbing his nearly bald head im afraid ill be seeing you after school again you can give cuddless cage a double cleaning and while youre at it you can scrub the chalkboards and clean out all the test tubes too its so dark evan whispered it usually gets dark at night andy replied rolling her eyes the streetlight is out evan said pointing and theres no moon tonight thats why its so dark hide andy whispered they ducked behind the hedge as a car rolled slowly past evan shut his eyes as the white headlights moved over him when the car turned the corner they climbed to their feet it was a little after eight oclock they were standing in the street in front of conans house leaning against the low hedge they stared across the sloping front lawn into the large picture window in the front of the house the lamp in the living room was lit casting a dim rectangle of orange light that spilled onto the front yard the old trees at the sides of the small brick house whispered in a hot breeze are we really doing this evan asked huddling close to andy are we really going to break into conans house were not going to break in andy whispered were going to sneak in but what if the monster blood isnt there evan asked hoping she couldnt see his knees trembling we have to look dont we andy shot back she turned to study his face he saw that she was frightened too the monster blood will be there she told him its got to be bending low she started to creep across the dark yard to the house evan hung back you checked it out he called to her everyone is really gone his parents left right after dinner andy told him then i saw conan go out about ten minutes ago where evan demanded how should i know she asked sharply putting her hands on her waist he left the house is empty she came back and tugged evans arm come on lets sneak into conans room get the monster blood and get out of here i cant believe were doing this evan said sighing we we could be arrested it was your idea andy reminded him oh yeah right he took a deep breath and held it hoping it would help calm him down if we dont find it right away we get put of there right right andy agreed now come on she gave him a little shove toward the house they took a few steps over the dewwet grass they both stopped when they heard the low barking andy grabbed evans arm the barking grew louder they could hear the dogs heavy paws pounding the ground approaching fast two angry eyes a loud warning bark another the dog attacked at full speed run evan cried conan has a guard dog too late to run andy shrieked the dog barked again evan cried out and threw up his hands as the dog leaped for his throat the dog wasnt as big as evan had thought but it was strong it licked his face pressing its wet snout into his cheek it licked his chin and then his lips yuck evan cried laughing trigger how did you get here evan pulled the cocker spaniel off him and lowered it to the ground its stubby tail wagging furiously trigger started jumping on andy your dumb dog scared me to death she moaned me too evan admitted i didnt hear him following us did you andy squatted down and gave trigger a few quick pats then she glanced down the street lets get inside she said conan or his parents could be back any minute trigger pranced along as they made their way over the grass to the front door the house loomed much bigger and darker as they crept onto the stoop down trigger stay down evan whispered you cant come in with us andy tried the front door locked evan groaned now what we try the back door of course andy replied she had already jumped down off the stoop and was heading around the side of the house youve done this before havent you evan demanded following her maybe she replied grinning at him in the dark a loud howl somewhere nearby made them both stop what was that evan cried a werewolf andy told him calmly or maybe a cat they both laughed nervous laughter the back door was locked too but the kitchen window was open a crack evan pushed it open wider and they crept into the dark kitchen holding his breath evan could hear every sound their sneakers scraped noisily against the linoleum the refrigerator hummed water swirled in the dishwasher i can even hear the pounding of my heart evan thought what am i doing have i really broken into conans house this way andy whispered his room is probably upstairs evan kept against the wall as he followed andy to the front stairs they passed the small living room bathed in orange light the floorboards creaked under their shoes evan stumbled over a pile of old newspapers stacked in the narrow hallway up the wooden stairs the banister squeaked under evans hand a venetian blind rattled against an open window startling him sure is dark andy muttered as they reached the top of the stairs evan tried to reply but his breath caught in his throat holding onto the wall he followed andy to the first bedroom she fumbled until she found a light switch then clicked it on the ceiling light revealed that they had found conans room they both stood in the doorway waiting for their eyes to adjust to the light then they quickly glanced around the walls of the small square room were filled with posters of sports stars the biggest poster above conans bed showed michael jordan jumping about ten feet in the air as he slamdunked a basketball a bookshelf against one wall held very few books but was loaded with sports trophies that conan had won on various teams suddenly andy started to laugh evan turned to her startled whats so funny she pointed to conans bed look he still has a teddy bear evan turned his eyes to the bed where a forlornlooking nearly flat oneeyed teddy bear rested on the pillow conan the barbarian he cried laughing he sleeps with a teddy bear a loud creak made them cut their laughter short they listened hard their eyes wide with fear just the house evan whispered andy shivered enough fooling around lets find the monster blood and get out of here they moved into the center of the room where do you think he hid it evan asked pulling open the closet door he didnt andy replied huh evan spun around andy had the blue can of monster blood in her hand grinning she held it up to show evan evan let out a surprised cry you found it where right on this shelf she replied pointing he put it next to his tennis trophies evan hurried over to her and took the blue can from her hand as he held it up to examine it the lid popped off the green monster blood began bubbling over the top of the can its growing fast evan declared andy stooped down and picked up the lid she handed it to evan put it back on hurry evan tried pushing the lid back on it kept slipping off hurry up andy urged weve got to go the monster blood its up over the top evan cried shove it down andy instructed evan tried pushing the green gunk down into the can pressing against it with the palm of his hand then he tried pushing it with three fingers he gasped as he felt the green goo tighten around his fingers and start to pull them down it its got me evan stammered andys mouth dropped open huh its got my fingers evan cried shrilly it wont let go as andy hurried to help him they both heard the front door slam someones home evan whispered tugging to pull his fingers free were caught andy froze in the center of the room her eyes wide with horror evan nearly dropped the can of monster blood the sticky green substance tightened its grip on his fingers making loud sucking sounds but evan only cared about the sounds coming from downstairs im home he heard conan shout were home too it was a womans voice probably conans mother theyre all home evan whispered were dead meat andy murmured im going upstairs conan called to his parents evan let out a terrified cry as he heard conans heavy footsteps on the stairs andy whwhat do we do he stammered the window she replied they both lunged toward the open window and peered out a narrow concrete ledge stretched just beneath the window without hesitating andy raised a leg over the windowsill and climbed out onto the ledge evan hurry she whispered gesturing frantically evan was still desperately trying to pull his fingers from the bubbling green goo andy reached in through the window and grabbed him by the shoulder evan he heard conans footsteps in the upstairs hall just outside the bedroom using his free hand for support evan scrambled out the window and joined andy on the narrow ledge ddont look down andy instructed in a trembling whisper evan didnt obey he glanced down the ground seemed very far below they each stood on a side of the window andy to the left evan the right they pressed their bodies against the brick wall and listened they heard conan step into the room did he notice that the light had been turned on no way to tell loud rap music suddenly jarred the silence conan had turned on his boom box he started chanting offkey along with the music evan pressed as tightly against the side of the house as he could go back downstairs conan he pleaded silently please go back downstairs how will andy and i ever get away from here he wondered feeling all of his muscles tighten in panic despite the hot night air a cold chill ran down evans back he shuddered so hard he nearly toppled off the ledge the blue can stuck to his hand the monster blood sucked at his fingers but he couldnt worry about that now he could hear conan moving around inside the room was he dancing to the loud music evan glanced across the window at andy her eyes were shut her face was clenched in a tight frown andy evan whispered he knew that conan couldnt hear a whisper over the booming music andy itll be okay as soon as he leaves well jump inside and sneak down the stairs andy nodded without opening her eyes did i ever tell you im afraid of heights she whispered no evan replied well remind me to tell you well be okay he murmured clinging to the side of the house evan kept repeating those words to himself well be okay well be okay well be okay then trigger started to bark a low bark of surprise at first and then a louder series of barks insistent barks excited barks evan swallowed hard he glanced down to the ground trigger was peering up at him jumping against the side of the house as if trying to reach the ledge the dog barked louder with each jump trigger no evan called down in a frantic whisper that only made the dog bark more furiously did conan hear it could he hear triggers ferocious barks over the music trigger stop go home go home suddenly the music stopped triggers excited barks rose up even louder against the new silence conan must hear them now evan realized the cocker spaniel threw himself wildly against the side of the house trying to get up to evan and andy despite evans frantic signals to be quiet the dumb dog barked his head off evans breath caught in his throat as he heard conan making his way to the window a second later conan stuck his head out whats going on he shouted evans knees buckled he started to fall evan clung to the brick wall and stopped his fall he stared at conans blond hair poking out the window evan was close enough to reach out and touch it shut up down there conan shouted that made trigger bark even louder hes going to see us evan thought trembling all over theres no way conan wont see us conan come downstairs mrs barbers voice floated up from downstairs conan come down and have your cake and ice cream you said you were dying for dessert she called conans head disappeared back into the bedroom theres some stupid dog barking down there he called to his mother clinging to the side of the house struggling to keep his quivering knees from buckling again evan shut his eyes and listened he heard conans footsteps cross the room the bedroom light went out silence he left evan choked out andy let out a long breath i cant believe he didnt see us out here evan glanced down to the ground trigger had finally stopped barking but he continued to stand and stare up at them his front paws against the side of the house his stubby tail spinning like a propeller dumb dog evan muttered lets go andy urged she didnt wait for evan she practically did a swan dive into the house it took evan a few moments to get his legs to work then he ducked his head and climbed through the window after andy holding his breath he led the way on tiptoe to the bedroom door he stopped and listened silence no one in the dark hallway he could hear the barbers voices downstairs in the kitchen he and andy made their way to the top of the stairs then holding tightly to the banister they crept halfway down evan stopped to listen again andy bumped right into him nearly sending him sailing down the stairs shhh she cried they could hear conan talking to his parents in the kitchen he was complaining about the other guys on the basketball team theyre all wimps evan heard conan say well thatll make you took even better mr barber replied evan took another deep breath and held it then he made his way down to the bottom of the stairs almost out he thought his entire body shaking almost out of here he reached for the front doorknob conan go upstairs and get your math book he heard mr barber say i want to see the homework you had trouble with okay conan replied his chair scraped against the floor andy grabbed evans shoulder they stared in frozen horror at each other one foot away from escape and waited to be caught conan dont go now get the book later mrs barber chimed in then they heard her scold conans father let the boy have his cake and ice cream fine fine mr barber replied he can show me the book later conans chair scraped back into place under the table evan didnt wait another second he jerked open the front door pushed open the screen door and burst out of the house like a rocket he could hear andy gasping as she ran behind him and then he could hear triggers shrill yips as the dog followed too down the barbers front lawn into the street their sneakers slapped the pavement as they ran full speed through the darkness they didnt stop until they reached evans driveway evan leaned against his familys mailbox and struggled to catch his breath he raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead and saw the blue can still stuck there help me he pleaded he reached out his hand to andy she was breathing hard too her eyes kept darting back down the street as if she expected conan to be chasing after them close one she murmured she turned to evan her eyes glowed excitedly in the light from the streetlamp that was fun evan didnt agree in his opinion it was far too scary to be fun and here he was still stuck to the can of monster blood he pushed his hand toward andy pull it off he told her i think you need both hands i cant do it she grabbed the can in both hands the green gunk bubbled over the sides making loud sucking sounds andy tugged then tugged harder then she took a deep breath leaned back and tugged with all her might the monster blood finally let go of its grip on evans fingers the can slid off with a loud pop andy went tumbling back onto the pavement ow evan held up his three fingers and tried to examine them under the streetlight they were all wrinkled and pruney the way they looked when he had been swimming for an hour or two yuck that stuff is so gross he cried andy climbed slowly to her feet she still cradled the monster blood can in both hands at least we got it back she murmured yeah now we can bury it again evan said still examining his fingers huh bury it andy pulled the can away as if protecting it from evan you heard me evan said firmly its just too dangerous to mess with andy take it home and bury it in your back yard okay andy stared down at the can she didnt reply bury it evan repeated take it home and bury it promise well andy hesitated then she said okay promise evan woke up with a bad sore throat the next morning his mother worried that he might be coming down with the flu so she kept him home from school evan spent the day reading comic books and watching mtv his sore throat disappeared by midafternoon he returned to school the next day feeling refreshed and ready to see everyone the good feeling lasted until he stepped into mr murphys science class near the end of the day evan had to walk past the hamster cage to get to his seat as he neared the cage he peered in thats weird he thought wheres cuddles when did mr murphy get a rabbit a rabbit he stopped and leaned closer to the cage familiar black eyes stared up at him a familiar pink nose twitched at him it was cuddles evan realized cuddles had grown as big as a rabbit evan leaned over the hamster cage staring at the giantsized cuddles as the bell rang he turned to see that the other kids had all taken their seats evan i see youre examining your victim mr murphy said from the front of the room i uh evan couldnt think of a reply victim mr murphy angrily narrowed his beady black eyes at evan youve been overfeeding cuddles evan look how fat he has become almost as fat as you evan wanted to say evan knew that cuddless weight problem wasnt his fault and it had nothing to do with overeating cuddles had grown to triplehamster size because of monster blood when i find andy ill strangle her evan muttered what did you say evan mr murphy demanded evan could feel his face turning bright red he hadnt meant to talk out loud uh nothing he replied totally embarrassed he slunk to his seat andy has gone too far this time he thought bitterly she promised shed bury the monster blood she promised and now shes turned cuddles into a fat freak and murphy thinks its all my fault please stay after school mr murphy told evan so we can discuss cuddless diet evan heard some kids snickering he knew they were laughing at him he saw conan and biggie at their seats in the back conan was twitching his nose puffing out his cheeks pretending to be a fat hamster biggie was laughing his head off evan stared at the hamster all through class cuddles appeared to grow right before evans eyes with each breath the hamster seemed to puff up wider and taller its black eyes were as big as marbles how they stared back at evan as if accusing him when the hamster moved to its water tube the entire cage rattled and shook please dont grow anymore evan pleaded silently staring at the shaking cage please stop right now cuddles okay the hamster breathed noisily wheezing gasps evan could hear cuddles panting all the way across the room the cage shook again as cuddles turned around evan watched in horror as the cage nearly toppled off its table ill kill andy evan thought bitterly how could she do this to me when the bell rang the other kids all gathered up their books and headed out the door evan stood up and walked over to cuddless cage panting loudly cuddles stared up at him hes too big to fit on his wheel evan realized if he grows any more hell burst out of the cage how much monster blood did andy feed him evan wondered he had to find out he turned to mr murphy who was reading over some papers at his desk ive got to find someone evan called up to him ill be right back dont take too long the teacher replied without looking up evan hurried from the room and ran into conan hey i was looking for you conan said sidestepping to the right then the left and stretching out both arms to keep evan from getting away no time now evan said sharply but conan wouldnt let him pass im kind of in a hurry evan told him i dont have time to be stuffed into my locker right now a big grin crossed conans handsome face hey im sorry about that he said his blue eyes twinkling huh youre sorry evans mouth dropped open in shock yeah no hard feelings conan said lowering his eyes shake evan stuck out his hand then remembered conans crushing handshake he tried to pull back his hand too late conan gripped it tightly and began to squeeze as he squeezed evans hand his grin grew wider and wider down the hall evan saw andy heading out the door he tried to call to her but all that came out of his mouth was a squeak of pain andy disappeared out the front door of the school the bones in evans hand cracked and crunched when conan finally let go the hand looked like a sad lump of soft red clay wow thats some handshake youve got conan cried laughing he pretended his hand hurt he shook it hard and blew on it you killed me that time you been working out or something conan headed off to basketball practice laughing and shaking his hand he really cracks himself up evan thought an angry cry burst from his throat he slammed his good hand into a locker he was so furious he thought he could feel steam pouring out his ears evan youre keeping me waiting mr murphy called in a singsong from the classroom doorway coming evan muttered miserably and slunk back into the room he tried calling andy for hours that night but there was no one home in his sleep he dreamed that trigger ate a big glob of monster blood and grew to giant size evan tried to stop him but the enormous dog took off after the mailman it wasnt much of a chase trigger caught the mailman easily the mailman was the size of a hamster evan woke up drenched with sweat he glanced at his bedtable clock only six in the morning he normally didnt get up until seven he climbed out of bed anyway feeling shaky and scared he decided he had to get to school before everyone else he had to see if cuddles had grown any bigger evan where are you going his mother called sleepily as evan headed out the front door uh school evan replied he had hoped to sneak out before she woke up so early she padded into the room struggling with the belt to her blue cotton robe well i have a science project i need to work on evan told her it was almost the truth a science project she eyed him suspiciously yeah its big evan replied thinking quickly its really big so i couldnt bring it home youre going without any breakfast mrs ross demanded yawning ill grab something at school he said later mom he disappeared out the door before she could ask any more questions a red sun was just climbing over the trees in a gray sky the air still carried the chill of the night the lawns evan passed shimmered wetly with morning dew he jogged the whole way his backpack flopping heavily on his shoulder there were no other kids on the playground or on the walk heading into the building he crept into the school and made his way down the silent empty hall his sneakers echoed loudly as he trotted toward the science classroom maybe cuddles didnt grow overnight evan told himself maybe he didnt grow at all maybe he shrank maybe he shrank back to his old size it was possible it was possible that andy had fed the hamster only a teeny tiny speck of monster blood just enough for cuddles to swell up to the size of a fat rabbit then shrink right back down to cute cuddly hamster size it was possible wasnt it yes yes evan crossed his fingers on both hands he wished he could cross his toes by the time he reached the classroom he was breathless his heart thudded loudly in his chest he hesitated at the door please cuddles be small be small then evan took a deep breath held it and stepped inside evan stepped into the room staring at the cage against the far wall at first he didnt see cuddles had cuddles shrunk had he sometimes prayers are answered evan told himself sometimes good things happen evan took a few hesitant steps closer then a few more steps every muscle in his body had tensed he was so frightened it was actually hard to walk he could feel the blood throbbing at his temples he mopped the cold beads of sweat off his forehead he still couldnt see cuddles where was he where gray morning light filtered in through the windows the floor creaked under evans sneakers evan took another hesitant step toward the cage another step then he cried out in horror evan hadnt seen cuddles at first because cuddles was too big cuddles filled the entire cage evan held back gaping in disbelief the hamster groaned noisily with every loud breath it let out several disgusting grunts as its body pressed against the wire cage its big furry head pushed up against the top of the cage evan could see one enormous black eye the size of a jar lid staring out at him no evan cried out loud feeling his knees begin to tremble this is impossible the hamster uttered a few more low grunts the cage shook on its table the big black eye glared out at evan and then as evan stared in horrified disbelief the hamster reached up its two pink paws the toes slipped around the wires of the cage cuddles let out an ugly groan evan saw its spongy pink nose twitch he saw a flash of big white teeth another groan the two front paws pushed against the cage wires the wires bent away cuddles grunted again wheezing loudly excitedly he pushed the cage wires aside then he started to squeeze his big furcovered body through the opening what do i do evan frantically asked himself what do i do now cuddles is escaping so what did you do andy asked they were sitting together in the tall grass of the tiny park watching the brown creek trickle past the late afternoon sun felt warm on their backs crickets chirped in the trees behind them three boys rolled past on bikes on the other side of the creek heading home from school one of them waved to evan he didnt wave back andy wore a bright red sleeveless tshirt over white denim jeans she had slipped off her yellow sneakers and was digging her bare feet into the soft ground so what did you do she repeated evan picked up a hard clump of dirt and tossed it into the creek then he leaned back his hands planted firmly behind him on the ground i got a dog leash he told andy in the supply closet andys eyes widened in surprise murphy keeps a dog leash what for evan shrugged he has all kinds of junk back there so you put the leash on cuddles yeah evan told her he was just the right size as big as a dog maybe a little bigger as big as trigger andy demanded evan nodded then i tied the other end to the leg of murphys desk and i ran out of there as fast as i could andy laughed but she cut it short when she caught evans angry glare what happened when you went to science class she asked turning back to the creek i didnt evan muttered huh i didnt go evan said softly i was afraid to go i didnt want murphy to start blaming me in front of everyone so you cut class andy asked startled evan nodded so what did you do andy asked she pulled up a handful of the tall grass and let it sift through her fingers i sneaked out and came here evan replied frowning everyone was talking about cuddles all day andy reported her dark eyes flashed she couldnt keep an amused grin off her face everyone had to go in and see him the stupid hamster practically caused a riot it isnt funny evan murmured its kind of funny andy insisted mr murphy was bragging that cuddles could beat up any other hamster in the country he said he was going to try to get cuddles on tv huh evan jumped to his feet you mean mr murphy wasnt upset i heard that he was at first andy replied thoughtfully but then i guess he got used to cuddles being so big and he was acting kind of proud you know like he had the biggest pumpkin at the fair or something a blueribbon winner andy snickered evan kicked at the grass i know hes going to blame me i know it everyone was feeding cuddles carrots all day andy said not seeming to hear evans unhappy wails the hamster ate the carrots whole one big chomp then it made this really gross swallowing sound it was a riot i cant believe this evan groaned he lowered his eyes angrily to andy why did you do it why andy gazed up at him innocently i wanted to give you a laugh she replied huh a laugh he shrieked you were looking pretty down i thought it might cheer you up evan let out an angry cry i guess it didnt cheer you up andy muttered she pulled up another handful of grass and let the blades fall over the legs of her white jeans evan stomped over to the edge of the creek he kicked a rock into the water come on evan andy called you have to admit its a little funny he spun around to face her its not he insisted not funny at all what if cuddles just keeps growing and growing then what we could put a saddle on his back and give everyone hamster rides she giggled evan scowled and kicked another rock into the creek you know how dangerous that monster blood is he scolded what are we going to do how are we going to get cuddles back to hamster size andy shrugged she pulled up another handful of grass the sun sank lower behind the trees a shadow rolled over them two little kids chased a whiteandred soccer ball on the other side of the creek their mother shouted to them not to get wet wheres the monster blood can evan demanded standing over andy maybe it tells the antidote on the can maybe it tells how to reverse the whole thing andy shook her head evan you know it doesnt say anything on the can no instructions no ingredients nothing she climbed to her feet and brushed off the legs of her jeans ive got to get home my aunt doesnt know where i am shes probably having a cow evan followed her toward the street shaking his head how big he muttered she glanced back at him what did you say how big will cuddles be tomorrow evan asked in a trembling voice how big andy will you hurry up evan had agreed to meet andy at her aunts house the next morning so they could go to school early but andy had found a spot on her jeans and had gone back up to her room to change and now they were no longer early sorry she said hurtling down the stairs two steps at a time she had changed her entire outfit now she had on a redandblackstriped vest over a yellow tshirt pulled down over pale blue shorts didnt you leave out a color evan demanded sarcastically grabbing andys backpack for her and hurrying to the front door she made a face at him i like bright colors it suits my personality your personality is late he declared she followed him out the door and down the front lawn to the sidewalk at least i have a personality she cried whats your hurry anyway evan didnt answer he adjusted his backpack on his shoulder then began running toward school hey wait up andy called running after him how much monster blood did you give cuddles anyway evan demanded without slowing his pace the whole can no way andy called breathlessly just a spoonful he seemed to like it i guess he liked being as big as a dog too evan said turning the corner the tall redbrick school building came into view maybe hes back to normal today andy said but as they came near the building it was easy to tell that things were not normal evan heard a loud crash from the side of the building it sounded like glass shattering then he heard excited shouts loud kids voices filled with alarm whats going on andy cried they dove up the stairs and burst into the building running full speed they turned the corner and made their way to the science classroom evan reached it a few steps ahead of andy hearing excited shouts and cries he lurched into the room and then stopped with a startled cry no oh please no stand back everyone stand back a redfaced mr murphy was screaming cuddles uttered a loud grunt and flailed his giant legs wildly in the air he hes ten feet tall evan heard andy scream at his side alalmost evan stammered the grunting groaning hamster towered over mr murphy its pink paws batted the air its monstrous mouth opened wide revealing two enormous sharp white teeth back everyone back mr murphy shrieked the terrified kids in the classroom pressed back against the walls mr murphy picked up a wooden chair in one hand the torn dog leash in the other holding the chair by the back he came at the granting monster like a lion tamer down cuddles get down sit sit he poked the wooden chair up at the giant hamster and snapped the dog leash like a whip cuddless watery black eyes as big as soccer balls glared down at the redfaced teacher the hamster didnt seem terribly impressed with mr murphys liontamer act down cuddles get down the teachers chins quivered and his big belly bounced up and down beneath his tight gray knit polo shirt cuddles pulled back his huge lips and bared his white teeth he let out a growl that made the light fixtures shake terrified cries rang out through the room evan glanced back to see a horrified crowd of teachers and students jammed in the doorway down cuddles mr murphy shoved the wooden chair up at the raging hamster he cracked the dogleash whip near the hamsters throbbing furcovered belly the huge black eyes stared down angrily at mr murphy the pink hamster paws clawed in the air andy grabbed evans shoulder and held on tight this is terrible she cried terrible evan started to reply but frightened shrieks drowned out his words cuddles grabbed the chair with both paws drop drop mr murphy screamed he struggled to hold on to the chair cuddles pulled the chair mr murphy desperately held tight he let the leash fall so he could hold on to the chair with both hands the teacher and cuddles had a short tugofwar cuddles won easily the hamster pulled the chair up nearly jerking mr murphys arms out of their sockets with a loud groan the teacher toppled heavily to the floor kids screamed two teachers rushed forward to help the gasping mr murphy to his feet evan stared up as the hamster raised the wooden chair to its mouth the enormous white teeth opened quickly the pink nose twitched the watery black eyes blinked then cuddles chewed the wooden chair to pieces splinters rained down on the floor the chomping teeth sounded like a lumberjacks ax biting into a tree evan froze in horror along with everyone else in the room andy was squeezing his shoulder so hard it hurt this is our fault she murmured our fault evan cried our fault she ignored his sarcasm he saw the fear in her eyes as she stared up at the hamster cuddles had turned the chair into toothpicks weve got to do something evan she whispered huddled close to him but what evan replied in a trembling voice what can we do then suddenly he had an idea come with me evan cried tugging andys arm she hesitated staring up at the giant hamster where i have an idea evan told her but we have to hurry cuddles lumbered over to mr murphys desk the hamsters heavy footsteps made the floor sag here fella here mr murphy was tossing handfuls of sunflower seeds up to cuddles cuddles glared down at him the seeds were too small to bother with hurry evan pleaded he pulled andy through the frightened crowd of kids and teachers at the door then he began running full speed toward the auditorium we cant just run away we have to do something andy cried were not running away evan called back to her turning a corner my fathers sculpture its in the auditorium huh andys eyes narrowed in confusion evan have you totally lost it why do you want to look at your fathers sculpture now he burst through the auditorium doors and ran past the dark rows of seats toward the stage several pieces of sculpture had been set up there evan i dont get it andy cried right behind him look evan said breathlessly he pointed to his fathers work near the back of the stage my dads sculpture its just like a hamster wheel see her mouth dropped open as she stared at it its a big metal wheel and it spins evan explained as they pulled themselves up onto the stage come on help me drag it back to murphys room its big enough for cuddles whoa andy cried you want to bring cuddles a wheel what for to distract him evan replied grabbing one side of the big sculpture if we can get cuddles running on this wheel it will give us time to figure out where to keep him and it will stop him from chewing the whole school to pieces andy grabbed hold of the other side one hand on the wheel one hand on the platform maybe cuddles will run so hard hell lose weight maybe hell shrink back to his normal size she said luckily the platform was on wheels they rolled the sculpture toward the stage door at the side i just want to distract him evan said tugging hard i just want to give us time to think to make a plan wow this is heavy andy cried they rolled it into the hall heavy enough for cuddles i guess i hope evan replied solemnly by the time they rolled the sculpture to the classroom the crowd of frightened kids and teachers had grown even bigger make way make way they both shouted pushing their way through the crowd they set the wheel down in the center of the floor and gazed over at cuddles the hamster had two teachers cornered their backs pressed against the chalkboard it was gnashing its huge teeth at them slapping its pink paws together as if eager to fight them evan gasped when he saw mr murphys desk crushed flat on the floor i i called the police mr murphy cried his face beaded with large drops of sweat i begged them to come but when i said it was a giant hamster they didnt believe me they thought it was a practical joke stand back everyone evan cried shrilly stand back please let cuddles see the wheel the giant hamster turned suddenly the two teachers scrambled away from the wall kids and teachers screamed and hurried toward the door maybe hell run on the wheel for a while andy explained to mr murphy then we can figure out what to do with him he he sees it mr murphy cried breathlessly all of his chins quivering at once cuddles stared down at the wheel his stub of a tail thudded loudly against the chalkboard he dropped heavily to all fours and took a lumbering step toward the wheel he sees it hes going to it evan murmured softly a hush fell over the room as everyone stared at the hamster will cuddles climb inside evan wondered holding his breath will he run on the wheel will my plan work the hamster sniffed the wheel its pink nose twitched it uttered a low grunt then it raised itself back onto its hind legs the hamsters massive shadow fell over the room with another disgusting grunt it picked the sculpture up in its front paws and raised it to its face no evan cried cuddles no the metal clanged as cuddles bit into the wheel evan saw deep tooth marks in the aluminum cuddles bit down again then seeing that he couldnt chew the wheel up he pulled it apart holding the sculpture in his paws and twisting it furiously with his teeth then he tossed the mangled wheel away it slammed into a window shattering it into a thousand pieces back to the drawing board andy muttered to evan evan shook his head glumly that plan was a bust he told himself now what he didnt have time to think about it he heard shrill cries and shrieks of terror put him down cuddles put him down mr murphy was screaming evan turned and saw that the giant hamster had picked up a kid conan cuddles held conan in both paws and was raising him toward his gaping mouth drop drop mr murphy was shouting conan thrashed his arms and legs help me ohhh hellllp me he shrieked he started to cry gasping sobs tears rolled down his red cheeks helllllp mommmmmy mommmmmy hellllp me normally evan would have enjoyed watching conan cry like a baby but this was too serious cuddles could chew conan in half evan realized he grabbed andy wheres the monster blood huh in my locker i hid it under a bunch of stuff in my locker why i need it evan said come on i have another idea i hope its better than the last one andy muttered they hurried to the door then glanced back cuddles was playing with conan tossing him from paw to paw licking him with his huge pink tongue conan was wailing his head off evan led the way to andys locker im going to eat some monster blood he told her thinking out loud ill eat a lot ill grow bigger than cuddles i get it andy said running beside him youll turn yourself into a giant youll make yourself as big as cuddles no evan replied bigger much bigger ill make myself so big that cuddles will look hamster size then ill stuff him in the supply closet and lock the door its a stupid plan andy said i know evan agreed but its worth a try andy added evan swallowed hard and didnt reply he was staring across the hall at andys locker oh no andy cried out when she saw what evan was gaping at the locker door bulged as if about to burst open and green goo poured out from the sides and the bottom the monster blood it outgrew my locker andy cried evan ran up to it and grabbed the door handle he started to tug is it locked no andy replied hanging back evan tugged he tugged harder with a loud groan he tugged with both hands it wont open he cried let me try it andy said but before she could step forward the locker door burst open with a loud whoooosh sticky green gunk splashed over evan he didnt have a chance to cry out it poured over him like a tall cresting ocean wave an ocean wave of monster blood its burying me evan realized the huge sticky glob splashed out of the locker plopped over him smothering him choking him its sucking me in i cant move i cant move evan shut his eyes as the heavy green gunk rolled over his head he shot his arms out trying to push it away as it swept over him he fell to his knees kicking and thrashing it forced him down to the floor im stuck inside he thought stuck inside he felt hands grab his ankles the hands tugged hard he began to slide over the floor over the thick layer of monster blood ive got you he heard andy cry ive got you out he opened his eyes he saw her pulling him tugging him out of the thick green gunk by the ankles it clung to his clothes and his skin but he was out thanks he murmured weakly he climbed shakily to his feet he could hear conan screaming and crying back in the classroom there was still time to save him evan realized he pulled a hunk of monster blood off the quivering green mound and jammed it into his mouth im going to be sick andy groaned holding her stomach evan swallowed and reached for another mouthful it doesnt taste bad he told her a little lemony dont eat too much she cried halfcovering her eyes as she watched him swallow another mouthful i have to grow big enough so that cuddles is hamster size compared to me evan said he grabbed another hunk he could already feel himself start to grow his head was already over the tops of the lockers back in the classroom conan let out another terrified wail lets go evan boomed his voice thundered deeply in his new larger body he could feel himself growing taller taller he had to lower his head to get through the classroom door kids and teachers moved out of his way crying out their surprise and alarm he crossed the room passed mr murphy and stepped up to the giant hamster im as big as cuddles evan called down to andy he reached out and lifted conan from cuddless paws cuddles reached out to take conan back but evan lowered him gently to the floor hellllp me helllp me conan ran bawling from the room evan turned to face the hamster they stared at each other eye to eye cuddless huge pink nose twitched he sniffed evan inhaling so hard that evan was nearly sucked forward evan took a step back keep growing he urged himself ive got to keep growing cuddles eyed him warily still sniffing his watery black eyes stared hard as if trying to figure out if evan was friend or foe dont you remember me cuddles evan said softly remember im the one who fed you after school every day keep growing he silently urged himself why arent i growing any taller down below he could see andy mr murphy and the others huddled against the far wall staring up at the two giants in hushed terror keep growing keep growing there was no way he could pick cuddles up now evan realized they were exactly the same height and cuddles outweighed him by at least a ton keep growing whats wrong andy evan called down to her in a trembling voice i ate tons of the stuff why did i stop growing i dont know she called up to him her voice sounded as tiny as a mouses squeak he saw that she had the blue can in her hand she was turning it over reading the label i dont know evan she shouted i dont know why youre not growing then as evan turned back to face cuddles the hamster reached out and grabbed his waist with both front paws ow evan cried as the hamster tried to lift him off the floor gazing up he saw the gaping hamster mouth open the sharp white teeth emerge evan squirmed desperately pulling himself loose then he wrapped both arms around the hamsters middle they started to wrestle evan fought hard but the hamster overpowered him cuddles rolled evan onto his back on the floor evan spun quickly away climbed to his feet and pulled the hamster down the two giants wrestled over the floor surrounded by the shrill screams of teachers and kids grow bigger grow bigger now evan pleaded but it was too late he saw the hamster lowered its hot furry body over him evan could feel the creatures booming heartbeat as it pressed him to the floor then its teeth rose up over evans head the hamsters mouth opened wide the teeth swung down a wave of hot sour hamster breath blew down over evan he shut his eyes sorry he murmured to andy he held his breath and waited for the teeth to clamp down evan heard a pop like the sound of a cork flying off a bottle still sprawled on his back on the floor evan opened his eyes huh cuddles had disappeared vanished evan stared up at the startled faces of kids and teachers against the wall whwheres cuddles he stammered andy stood frozen like a statue her mouth open evan slowly realized that she was nearly as big as he was in fact everyone was about his size he pulled himself up to a sitting position hey im back to my normal size he cried he shook his head hard as if trying to shake away his close call with the giant hamster theres cuddles andy cried pointing evan turned to see cuddles huddled against the wall hes a little hamster again evan exclaimed happily he took three quick steps bent down and grabbed cuddles between his hands gotcha holding the hamster in front of him he turned back to andy and the others what happened why did we shrink back andy was studying the blue monster blood can suddenly she tossed back her dark hair her brown eyes lit up and she started to laugh its the expiration date she cried happily the expiration date on the can its today the monster blood stops working today the magic has worn out evan let out a whoop of joy mr murphy a wide grin on his round face hurried over and put his arm around evans shoulders fine job evan fine job he exclaimed you saved the school im proud of you thanks mr murphy evan replied awkwardly youll never make a basketball player now that youre short again mr murphy said smiling but that was quite a good match with cuddles have you ever thought of trying out for the wrestling team andy came to evans house for dinner that night he greeted her at the door eager to tell her how all the kids had apologized for not believing him about the monster blood but before he could say anything she held up a large brown envelope and grinned at him whats that he asked following her into the living room its a present my parents sent me from europe she replied her grin growing wider you wont believe what it is she started to pull open the envelope but the front doorbell rang evan hurried to see who it was mr murphy he cried in surprise hi evan the teacher said his round body nearly filling the entire front stoop hope im not interrupting your dinner no evan replied want to come in no thanks mr murphy replied his expression turned solemn i came by because i thought you should have some sort of reward evan you were a real hero at school today aw not really evan said awkwardly he could feel his face growing hot and knew he was blushing what kind of reward evan wondered staring back at the teacher a cash reward mr murphy raised the hamster cage into evans view ive decided to reward you with cuddles the teacher said i know how fond of him you are no please evan started to plead its a small token mr murphy said to show how grateful i am how grateful we all are please no but before evan realized it the hamster cage was in his hand and mr murphy was waddling back down the driveway to his car he gave you cuddles andy asked as evan returned to the living room carrying the cage he set it down on the coffee table its my reward evan told her rolling his eyes do you believe it well you wont believe this andy declared look what my parents found in europe she reached into the envelope and pulled out a blue plastic can its monster blood oh no evan wailed they wrote that they remembered how much fun i had with the old can andy said holding up the blue container so when they saw this can in a toy store in germany they decided to send me a new one evans eyes went wide with fear you youre not going to open it he demanded warily already did andy replied just to take a look but im not going to use it really i promise evan started to say something but he was interrupted by his mothers call from the kitchen dinnertime you two wash your hands and come to the table andy set the can of monster blood down on the desk in the corner they obediently hurried to wash their hands they had a lively dinner there was lots to talk about they laughed and joked about all that had happened at school it was easy to laugh about it now that it was all over after dinner evan and andy returned to the living room andy was the first to see that the door to the hamster cage was wide open the cage was empty evan was the one who spotted cuddles on the desk cuddles what are you eating he cried what are you eating
