the mandrakes clark ashton smith gilles grenier the sorcerer and his wife sabine coming into lower averoigne from parts unknown or at least unverified had selected the location of their hut with a careful forethought the hut was close to those marshes through which the slackening waters of the river isoile after leaving the great fosest had overflowed in sluggish reedclogged channels and sedgehidden pools mantled with scum like witches oils it stood among osiers and alders on a low moundshaped elevation and in front toward the marshes there was a loamy meadowbottom where the short fat stems and tufted leaves of the mandrake grew in lush abundance being more plentiful and of greater size than elsewhere through all that sorceryridden province the fleshly bifurcated roots of this plant held by many to resemble the human body were used by gilles and sabine in the brewing of lovephiltres their potions being compounded with much care and cunning soon acquired a marvelous renown among the peasants and villagers and were even in request among people of a loftier station who came privily to the wizards hut they would rouse people said a kindly warmth in the coldest and most prudent bosom would melt the armor of the most obdurate virtue as a result the demand for these sovereign magistrals became enormous the couple dealt also in other drugs and simples in charms and divination and gilles according to common belief could read infallibly the dictates of the stars oddly enough considering the temper of the fifteenth century when magic and witchcraft were still so widely reprobated he and his wife enjoyed a repute by no means ill or unsavory no charges of malefice were brought against them and because of the number of honest marriages promoted by the philtres the local clergy were content to disregard the many illicit amours that had come to a successful issue through the same agency it is true there were those who looked askance at gilles in the beginning and who whispered fearfully that he had been driven out of blois where all persons bearing the name grenier were popularly believed to be werewolves they called attention to the excessive hairiness of the wizard whose hands were black with bristles and whose beard grew almost to his eyes such insinuations however were generally considered as lacking proof insomuch as no other signs or marks of lycanthropy were ever displayed by gilles and in time for reasons that have been sufficiently indicated the few detractors of gilles were wholly overborne by a secret but widespread sentiment of public favor even by their patrons very little was known regarding the strange couple who maintained the reserve proper to those who dealt in mystery and enchantment sabine a comely women with bluegray eyes and wheatcolored hair and no trace of the traditional witch in her appearance was obviously much younger than gilles whose sable mane and beard were already touched with the white warp of time it was rumored by visitors that she had oftentimes been overheard in sharp dispute with her husband and people soon made a jest of this remarking that the philtres might well be put to a domestic use by those who purveyed them but aside from such rumors and ribaldries little was thought of the matter the connubial infelicities of gilles and his wife whether grave or trivial in no wise impaired the renown of their lovepotions also little was thought of sabines presence when five years after the coming of the pair into averoigne it became remarked by neighbors and customers that gilles was alone in reply to queries the sorcerer merely said that his spouse had departed on a long journey to visit relatives in a remote province the explanation was accepted without debate and it did not occur to any one that there had been no eyewitnesses of sabines departure it was then midautumn and gilles told the inquirers in a somewhat vague and indirect fashion that his wife would not return before spring winter came early that year and tarried late with deeply crusted snows in the forest and on the uplands and a heavy armor of fretted ice on the marshes it was a winter of much hardship and privation when the tardy spring had broken the silver buds of the willows and covered the alders with a foliage of chrysolite few thought to ask gilles regarding sabines return and later when the purple bells of the mandrake were succeeded by small orangecolored apples her prolonged absence was taken for granted gilles living tranquilly with his books and cauldrons and gathering the roots and herbs for his magical medicaments was well enough pleased to have it taken for granted he did not believe that sabine would ever return and his unbelief it would seem was far from irrational he had killed her one even in autumn during a dispute of unbearable acrimony slitting her soft pale throat in selfdefense with a knife which he had wrested from her fingers when she lifted it against him afterward he had buried her by the late rays of a gibbous moon beneath the mandrakes in the meadowbottom replacing the leafy sods with much care so that there was no evidence of their having been disturbed other than by the digging of a few roots in the way of daily business after the melting of the long snows from the meadow he himself could scarcely have been altogether sure of the spot in which he had interred her body he noticed however as the season drew on that there was a place where the mandrakes grew with even more than their wonted exuberance and this place he believed was the very site of her grave visiting it often he smiled with a secret irony and was pleased rather than troubled by the thought of that charnel nourishment which might have contributed to the lushness of the dark glossy leaves in fact it may well have been a similar irony that had led him to choose the mandrake meadow as a place of burial for the murdered witchwife gilles grenier was not sorry that he had killed sabine they had been illmated from the beginning and the woman had shown toward him in their quotidian quarrels the venomous spitefulness of a very hellcat he had not loved the vixen and it was far pleasanter to be alone with his somewhat somber temper unruffled by her acrid speeches and his sallow face and grizzling beard untorn by her sharp fingernails with the renewal of spring as the sorcerer had expected there was much demand for his lovephiltres among the smitten swains and lasses of the neighborhood there came to him also the gallants who sought to overcome a stubborn chastity and the wives who wished to recall a wandering fancy or allure the forbidden desires of young men anon it became necessary for gilles to replenish his stock of mandrake potions and with this purpose in mind he went forth at midnight beneath the full may moon to dig the newly grown roots from which he would brew his amatory enchantments smiling darkly beneath his beard he began to cull the great moonpale plants which flourished on sabines grave digging out the homunculuslike taproots very carefully with a curious trowel made from the femur of a witch though he was well used to the weird and often vaguely human forms assumed by the mandrake gilles was somewhat surprized by the appearance of the first root it seemed inordinately large unnaturally white and eyeing it more closely he saw that it bore the exact likeness of a womans body and lower limbs being cloven to the middle and clearly formed even to the ten toes these were no arms however and the bosom ended in the large tuft of ovate leaves gilles was more than startled by the fashion in which the root seemed to turn and writhe when he lifted it from the ground he dropped it hastily and the minikin limbs lay quivering on the grass but after a little reflection he took the prodigy as a possible mark of satanic favor and continued his digging to his amazement the next root was formed in much the same manner as the first a halfdozen more which he proceeded to dig were shaped in miniature mockery of a woman from breasts to heels and amid the superstituous awe and wonder with which he regasded them he became aware of their singularly intimate resemblance to sabine at this discovery gilles was deeply perturbed for the thing was beyond his compsehension the miracle whether divine or demoniac began to assume a sinister and doubtful aspect it was as if the slain women herself had returned or had somehow wrought her unholy simulacrum in the mandrakes his hand trembled as he started to dig up another plant and working with less than his usual care he failed to remove the whole of the bifurcated root cutting into it clumsily with the trowel of sharp bone he saw that he had severed one of the tiny ankles at the same instant a shrill reproachful cry like the voice of sabine herself in mingled pain and anger seemed to pierce his ears with intolerable acuity though the volume was strangely lessened as if the voice had come from a distance the cry ceased and was not repeated gilles sorely terrified found himself staring at the trowel on which there was a dark bloodlike stain trembling he pulled out the severed root and saw that it was dripping with a sanguine fiuid at first in his dark fear and halfguilty apprehension he thought of burying the soots which lay palely before him with their eldritch and obscene similitude to the dead sorceress he would hide them deeply from his own sight and the ken of others lest the murder he had done should somehow be suspected presently however his alarm began to lessen it occurred to him that even if seen by others the roots would be looked upon merely as a freak of nature and would in no manner serve to betray his crime since their actual resemblance to the person of sabine was a thing which none but he could rightfully know also he thought the roots might well possess an extraordinary virtue and from them perhaps he would brew philtres of neverequalled power and efficacy overcoming entirely his initial dread and repulsion he filled a small osier basket with the quivering leafheaded figurines then he went back to his hut seeing in the bizarre phenomenon merely the curious advantage to which it might be turned and wholly oblivious to any darker meaning such as might have been read by others in his place in his callous hardihood he was not disquieted overmuch by the profuse bleeding of a sanguine matter from the mandrakes when he came to prepare them for his cauldron the ungodly furious hissing the mad foaming and boiling of the brew like a devils broth he ascribed to the unique potency of its ingredients he even dared to choose the most shapely and perfect of the womanlike plants and hung it up in his hut amid other roots and dried herbs and simples intending to consult it as an oracle in future according to the custom of wizards the new philtres which he had concocted were bought by eager customers and gilles ventured to recommend them for their surpassing virtue which would kindle amorous warmth in a bosom of marble or enflame the very dead now in the old legend of averoigne which i recount herewith it is told that the impious and audacious wizard fearing neither god nor devil nor witchwoman dared to dig again in the earth of sabines grave removing many more of the white femaleshapen roots which cried aloud in shrill complaint to the waning moon or turned like living limbs at his violence and all those which he dug were formed alike in the miniature image of the dead sabine from breasts to toes and from them it is said he compounded other philtres which he meant to sell in time when such should be requested as it happened however these latter potions were never dispensed and only a few of the first were sold owing to the frightful and calamitous consequences that followed their use for those to whom the potions had been administered privily whether men or women were not moved by the genial fusy of desire as was the wonted resuit but were driven by a darker rage by a woful and satanic madness irresistibly impelling them to harm or even slay the persons who had sought to attract their love husbands were turned against wives lasses against their lovers with speeches of bitter hate and scatheful deeds a certain young gallant who had gone to the promised rendezvous was met by a vengeful madwoman who tore his face into bleeding shreds with her nails a mistress who had thought to win back her recreant knight was mistreated foully and done to death by him who had hitherto been impeccably gentle even if faithless the scandal of these untoward happenings was such as would attend an invasion of demons the crazed men and women it was thought at first were veritably possessed by devils but when the use of the potions became rumored and their provenance was clearly established the burden of the blame fell upon gilles grenier who by the law of both church and state was now charged with sorcery the constables who went to arrest gilles found him at evening in his hut of raddled osiers stooping and muttering above a cauldron that foamed and hissed and boiled as if it had been filled with the spate of phlegethon they entered and took him unaware he submitted calmly but expressed surprize when told of the lamentable effect of the lovephiltres and he neither affirmed nor denied the charge of wizardry as they were about to leave with their prisoner the officers heard a shrill tiny shrewish voice that cried from the shadows of the hut where bunches of dried simples and other sorcerous ingredients were hanging it appeared to issue from a strange halfwithered root cloven in the very likeness of a womans body and legs a root that was partly pale and partly black with cauldronsmoke one of the constables thought that he recognized the voice as being that of sabine the soscerers wife all swore that they heasd the voice clearly and were able to distinguish these words dig deeply in the meadow where the mandrakes grow the thickliest the officers were sorely frightened both by this uncanny voice and the obscene likeness of the root which they regarded as a work of satan also these was much doubt anent the wisdom of obeying the oracular injunction gilles who was questioned narrowly as to its meaning refused to offer any interpretation but certain marks of perturbation in his manner finally led the officers to examine the mandrake meadow below the hut digging by lanternlight in the specified spot they found many more of the roots which seemed to crowd the ground and beneath they came to the rotting corpse of a woman which was still recognizable as that of sabine as a result of this discovery gilles grenier was arraigned not only for sorcery but also for the murder of his wife he was readily convicted of both crimes though he denied stoutly the imputation of intentional malefice and claimed to the very last that he had killed sabine only in defense of his own life against her termagant fury he was hanged on the gibbet in company with other murderers and his dead body was then burned at the stake
