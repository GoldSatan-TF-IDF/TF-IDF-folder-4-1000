symposium of the gorgon clark ashton smith i do not remember where or with whom the evening had begun nor can i recall what vintages brews and distillations i had mingled by the way in those nights of an alcoholically flaming youth i was likely to start anywhere drink anything and end up anywhere else than at the port of embarkation it was therefore with interest but with little surprise that i found myself among the guests at the symposium in the gorgons hall do not ask me how i got there i am still vague about it myself it would be useless to tell you even if i could unless you are one of the rare few elected for similar adventures and if you are one of these the telling would be needless liquor brings oblivion to most but to certain others enfranchisement from time and space the awareness of tao of all that is or has ever been or will ever be by liquor i mean of course the true essence poured from the dive bouteille but on occasion any bottle can be divine just why at that particular time after what must have been a round of mundane barrooms i should have entered the mythologic palace of medusa is a matter hardly apparent but determined no doubt by the arcanic and inflexible logic of alcohol the night had been foggy not to say wet and on such nights one is prone to stray into the unlikeliest places it was not the first time i bad gotten a little mixed up in regard to the einsteinian continuum having read bullfinch and other mythologists i had small difficulty in orienting myself to the situation at the moment of my entrance into the spacious early grecian hall i was stopped by a slavegirl attired only in three garlands of roses arranged to display and enhance her charms this girl presented me with a brightly polished silver mirror the rim and handle of which were twined appropriately with graven serpents she also gave me a capacious winecup of unglazed clay in a low voice in the purest greek of preeuripidean drama she told me the mirrors purpose the cup i could fill as often as i pleased or was able at a fountain of yellow wine in the foreground rilling from the open mouth of a marble sea nymph that rose from amidst its bubbling ripples thus forewarned i kept my eyes on the mirror which reflected the room before me with admirable clearness i saw that my fellowguests at least any who possessed handshad also been considerately equipped with mirrors in which they could look with safety at their hostess whenever politeness required medusa sat in a higharmed chair at the halls center weeping constant tears that could not dim the terrible brightness of her eyes her tonsure of curling serpents writhed and lifted incessantly on each arm of the chair perched a womanheaded womanbreasted fowl that i recognized as a harpy in other chairs the two sisters of medusa sat immobile with lowered eyes all three were draining frequent cups served with averted eyes by the slavegirls but showed no sign of intoxication there seemed to be a lot of statuary about the place men women dogs goats and other animals as well as birds these the first slavegirl whispered as she passed me consisted of the various unwary victims turned to stone by the gorgons glance in a whisper lower still she added that the fatal visit of perseus coming to behead medusa was momentarily expected i felt that it was high time for a drink and moved forward to the verge of the vinous pool a number of ducks and swans standing unsteadily about it with winesplashed plumage dipped their beaks in the fluid and tilted their heads back with obvious relish they hissed at me viciously as i stepped among them i slipped on their wet droppings and plunged hastily into the pool but still retained the cup and the mirror as well as my footing the fluid was quite shallow amid the loud quacking of the startled birds and the giggling of several goldentressed sirens and russethaired nereids who sat on the farther edge stirring the pool to luminous ripples with their codlike tails i stepped forward splashing ankledeep to the marble seagirl and lifted my cup to the yellow stream that issued from her grinning mouth the cup filled instantly and slopped over drenching my shirtfront i drained it at a gulp the wine was strong and good though tasting heavily of resin like other antique vintages before i could raise the cup for a second draft it seemed that a flash of lightning together with a violent wind leapt horizontally across the hall from the open doorway my face was fanned as if by the passing of a god forgetting the danger i raised my eyes toward medusa over whom the lightning hovered and swung back with the movement of a weapon about to strike i remember my mythology it was indeed the sword of perseus who wore mercurys winged shoes and the helmet loaned by hades which made him invisible the sword fell and the head of medusa sprang from her seated body and rolled in a spatter of blood across the floor and into the pool where i stood petrified it was a moment of pandemonium the ducks and geese scattered quacking honking madly and the sirens and nereids fled shrieking they dropped their mirrors as they went the head sank with a great splash then rose to the surface i caught a sidelong flick of one dreadful agonized eye the left as the head rolled over and soared from the water its snaky locks caught in an unseen armored grip by the pursuing demigod then perseus and his victim were gone with a last lightning flash of the sword through the doorway where the nymphs had vanished i climbed from the reddening pool too dazed to wonder why i still retained power of movement after meeting the gorgons eye the slavegirls had disappeared the trunk of medusa had fallen forward from its chair upon which the harpies still perched beside medusa stood a beautiful winged white horse dabbled from hoofs to mane with the blood that still ran from the fallen monsters neck i knew that it must be pegasus born of her decapitation according to myth pegasus pranced lightly toward me neighing in excellent greek we must go the decrees of the gods have been fulfilled i see that you are a stranger from another time and space i will take you wherever you wish to go or as near to it as possible pegasus kneeled and i mounted him bareback since he had been born without saddle or reins cling tightly to my mane i will not unhorse you he promised whatever the speed or altitude of our journey he trotted out through the doorway spread his shining wings on an orient dawn and took off toward the reddening cirrus clouds i turned my head a little later an ocean lay behind us far down with raging billows turned to mere ripples by distance the lands of morning gleamed before us to what period of time and what region asked pegasus above the rhythmic drumming of his wings i came from a country known as america in the th century i replied raising my voice to reach his ears through the thunder pegasus bridled and almost stopped in midflight my prophetic insight forbids me to oblige you i cannot visit the century and in particular the country that you name any poets who are born there must do without me must hoist themselves to inspiration by their own bootstraps rather than by the steed of the muses if i ventured to land there i should be impounded at once and my wings clipped later they would sell me for horse meat you underrate their commercial acumen i said theyd put you in a sideshow and charge a stiff entrance fee youre well known in a way your name and picture are on sideboards at many gasstations a synonym for speed if nothing else anyway there is little inducement for me to return i have been trying to drink myself out of it for years and decades why end up as i will sooner or later at the highly expensive mercy of doctors hospitals and undertakers you are certainly sensible will you indicate a place and period more to your liking i mused awhile reviewing all i could remember of both history and geography well i decided at last some south sea island might do before the discovery by captain cook and the coming of the missionaries pegasus began to accelerate his flight day and darkness shuttled by sun moon and stars were streaks above and the regions below were blurred by inconceivable speed so that i could not distinguish fertile from desert land from water we must have circled the earth innumerable times through the birth and death of millenniums gradually the speed of the winged horse decelerated a cloudless sun became stable overhead a balmy subtropic sea full of green islands rolled softly on all sides to the horizon pegasus made an easy landing on the nearest island and i slipped dizzily from his back good luck he neighed then stretching his wings once more he soared toward the sun and disappeared with the suddenness of a timemachine feeling that pegasus had abandoned me in a rather summary fashion i peered about at my surroundings at first sight i had been left in an uninhabited isle on a coral reef lined with untrodden grass and rimmed with pandanus and breadfruit trees presently the foliage stiffed and several natives crept forth they were elaborately tattooed and armed with wooden clubs studded with sharks teeth judging from their gestures of fear and wonder they had never seen a white man or a horse of any color winged or unwinged they dropped their clubs as they neared me and pointed questioning fingers a trifle shaky at the skies where pegasus had vanished think nothing of it i said in my suavest and most reassuring tones remembering a vague religious upbringing i made the sign of benediction the savages grinned shyly displaying an array of filed teeth only less formidable than the sharks incisors and molars that decorated their clubs plainly they were losing their fear and making me welcome to the island their eyes appraised me with inscrutable blandness like those of innocent children who expect someone to feed them i am pencilling this account in a small notebook found in one of my pockets three weeks have passed since pegasus left me among the cannibals they have treated me well and have fattened me with all the abundance that the isle affords with taro and roast pig with breadfruit cocoanuts guavas and many unknown delicious vegetables i feel like a thanksgiving turkey how do i know they are cannibals by human bones hair skin piled or strewn about as animal remnants are in the neighborhood of slaughterhouses apparently they have moved their feasting places only when the bones got too thick bones of men women children mixed with those of birds pigs and small four footed creatures an untidy lot even for anthropophagi the island is of small extent perhaps no more than a mile in width by two in length i have not learned its name and am uncertain to which of the many farflung archipelagos it belongs but i have picked up a few words of the soft manyvowelled language mainly the names of foodstuffs they have domiciled me in a clean enough hut which i occupy alone none of the women who are comely enough and quite friendly has offered to share it with me perhaps this is for therapeutic reasons perhaps they fear i might lose weight if i were to indulge in amorous activity anyway i am relieved all women are cannibalistic even if they dont literally tear the meat from ones bones they devour time money attention and give treachery in return i have long learned to avoid them long ago my devotion to drink became singlehearted liquor at least has been faithful to me it requires no eloquence no flattery no blandishments to me at least it makes no false promises i wish pegasus would return and carry me off again truly i made a chuckleheaded choice in selecting one of the south sea isles i am weaponless and i dont swim very well the natives could overtake me quickly if i stole one of their outrigger canoes i never was much good at boating even in my college days barring a miracle i am destined to line the gizzards of these savages the last few days they have allowed me all the palmwine i can drink perhaps they believe it win improve the flavor i swig it frequently and lie on my back staring at the bright blue skies where only parrots and seabirds pass i cannot get drunk and delirious enough to imagine that any of them is the winged horse and i curse them in five languages in english greek french spanish latin because they cannot be mistaken for pegasus perhaps if i had plenty of highproof scotch and bourbon i could walk out of this particular timeplexus into something quite different as i did from modem new york into the ancient palace of medusa another entry which i hardly expected to make i dont know the day the month the year the century but according to these misguided islanders and mine it was pot day they brought out the pot at midmorning a huge vessel of blackening battered bronze inscribed around the sides with chinese characters it must have been left here by some farstrayed or storm wrecked junk i dont like to conjecture the fate of the crew if any survived and came ashore being boiled in their own cookingpot must have been a curious irony to get back to my tale the natives had set out huge quantities of palmwine in crude earthen vessels and they and i were getting ginned up as fast as we could i wanted a share of the funeral feast even if i was slated to afford the piecederesistance presently there was a lot of jabbering and gesticulating the chief a big burly ruffian was giving orders a number of the natives scattered into the woods and some returned with vessels full of springwater which they emptied into the pot while others piled dry grass and wellseasoned fagots around its base a fire was started with flint and an old piece of metal which looked like the brokenoff end of a chinese swordblade it was probably a relic of the same junk that had provided the pot i hoped that the user had broken it only after laying out a long file of cannibals in a rather futile effort to raise my spirits i began to sing the marseillaise and followed it with lulu and various other bawdies presently the water was bubbling and the cooks turned their attention to me they seized me stripped off my ragged clothes and trussed me up adroitly knees to chest and arms doubled at the sides with some sort of tough vegetable fiber then singing what was doubtless a cannibal chanty they picked me up and heaved me into the pot where i landed with a splash and settled more or less upright in a sitting position at least i had thought they would knock me on the head beforehand rather than boil me like a live lobster in my natural fright and confusion it took me some moments to realize that the water which had seemed scalding hot was in reality no warmer to the epidermis than my usual morning tub in fact it was quite agreeable judging by the violence with which it bubbled beneath my chin it was not likely to grow much hotter this anomaly of sensation puzzled me mightily by all rights i should be suffering agonies then like a flash of lightning i remembered the passing sidelong flick of medusas left eye and the apparent lack of effect at the time her glance had in no way petrified mebut in some strange fashion it must have toughened my skin which was now impervious to the normal effects of heat and perhaps also to other phenomena perhaps to cause the mythic petrification it was necessary to sustain the regard of both the gorgons eyes these things are mysteries anyway it was as if i had been given a flexible asbestos hide but curiously enough my keeness of touch was unimpaired through the veering smoke i saw that the cooks were coming back laden with basket of vegetables they were all getting drunker and the chief was the drunkest he lurched about waving his warclub while the others emptied their baskets into the kettle only then did they perceive that things had not proceeded according to culinary rules their eyes grew rounder and they yelled with surprise to see me g at them from the steaming ebullient contents one of the cooks made a pass at my throat with a stone knifeand the knife broke in the middle then the chief stepped forward shouting ferociously and hoisted his toothed war club i ducked under water and to one side the club descended making a huge splashand missed me judging from their outcries some of the cooks must have been scalded by the flying water the chief fared worse overbalanced by that mighty stroke he lurched against the pot which careened heavily spilling much of the contents using my weight repeatedly against the side i managed to overthrow the vessel and rolled out in a torrent of water smoke and vegetables the chief yowling from what must have been third degree burns was trying to extricate himself from the brands and embers into which he had fallen limping he got to his feet after several vain attempts and staggered away the other cooks and the expectant feasters had already decamped i had the field to myself looking around i noticed the brokenoff sword which had been used in striking fire and levered myself in its direction holding it clumsily i contrived to work my wristfetters against the edge the blade was still fairly sharp and i soon had my hands free after that it was no trick to untruss my legs the wine had worn off but there were many unemptied pots of it still around i collected two or three and put some of the spilled vegetables to roast amid the glowing coals then waiting comfortably for the cannibals return i began to laugh i was washing down a wellbaked taro root with the second pot of wine when the first of them crawled out of the woods and fell prostrate before me i learned afterwards that they were deprecating my anger and were very sorry they had not recognized me as a god they have christened me in their own tongue the onewhocannotbecooked i wish that pegasus would return
