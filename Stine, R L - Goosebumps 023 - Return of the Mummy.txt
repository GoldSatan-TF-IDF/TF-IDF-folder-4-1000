gabe we will be landing soon the stewardess told me leaning over the seat will someone be meeting you at the airport yes probably an ancient egyptian pharaoh i told her or maybe a disgusting decaying mummy she narrowed her eyes at me no really she insisted who will be meeting you in cairo my uncle ben i replied but he likes to play practical jokes sometimes he dresses in weird costumes and tries to scare me you told me that your uncle was a famous scientist the stewardess said he is i replied but hes also weird she laughed i liked her a lot she had pretty blond hair and i liked the way she always tilted her head to one side when she talked her name was nancy and she had been very nice to me during the long flight to egypt she knew it was my first time flying all by myself she kept checking on me and asking me how i was doing but she treated me like a grownup she didnt bring me one of those dumb connectthedots books or a plastic wings pin that they always give to kids on planes and she kept slipping me extra bags of peanuts even though she wasnt supposed to why are you visiting your uncle nancy asked just for fun i nodded i did it last summer too i told her it was really awesome but this year uncle ben has been digging in an unexplored pyramid hes discovered an ancient sacred tomb and he invited me to be with him when he opens it up she laughed and tilted her head a little more you have a good imagination gabe she said then she turned away to answer a mans question i do have a good imagination but i wasnt making that up my uncle ben hassad is a famous archaeologist he has been digging around in pyramids for lots of years ive seen newspaper articles about him and once he was in national geographic last summer my entire family visited cairo my cousin sari and i shes uncle bens daughter had some amazing adventures down in the chambers of the great pyramid sari will be there this summer too i remembered staring out the plane window at the solid blue sky i wondered if maybe she would give me a break this time i like sari but shes so competitive she always has to be the first the strongest the smartest the best shes the only thirteenyearold girl i know who can turn eating breakfast into a contest flight attendants prepare for landing the pilot announced over the loudspeaker i sat up to get a better view out the window as the plane lowered i could see the city of cairo beneath us a slender blue ribbon curled along the city that i knew was the nile river the city stretched out from the river peering straight down i could see tall glass skyscrapers and low domed temples where the city ended the desert began yellow sand stretched to the horizon my stomach began to feel a little fluttery the pyramids were somewhere out in that desert and in a day or two i would be climbing down into one of them following my uncle into a tomb that hadnt been opened for thousands of years what would we find i pulled the little mummy hand from my shirt pocket and gazed down at it it was so tiny no bigger than a childs hand i had bought it from a kid at a garage sale for two dollars he said it was called a summoner he said it could summon ancient evil spirits it looked like a mummy hand the fingers were wrapped in stained gauze bandages with a little black tar showing through i thought it was a fake made of rubber or plastic i mean i never thought it was a real mummy hand but last summer the hand had saved all of our lives the kid who sold it to me was right it really did bring a bunch of mummies to life it was amazing of course my parents and my friends back home didnt believe my incredible story and they didnt believe that the summoner really worked they said it was just a joke mummy hand made in some souvenir factory probably made in taiwan but i carry it with me wherever i go it is my good luck charm im not very superstitious i mean i walk under ladders all the time and my lucky number is thirteen but i really do believe that the little mummy hand will protect me the strange thing about the mummy hand is that it is always warm it doesnt feel like plastic it feels warm like a real human hand back home in michigan i had a major panic attack when mom and dad were packing my suitcase for the flight i couldnt find the mummy hand and of course there was no way i would go to egypt without it i was so relieved when i finally found it it was tucked into the back pocket of a crumpledup pair of jeans now as the plane nosed down for a landing i reached for the hand in the pocket of my tshirt i pulled it out and gasped the hand was cold cold as ice why had the mummy hand suddenly turned cold was it some kind of a message a warning was i heading into danger i didnt have time to think about it the plane rolled into the gate and the passengers were scrambling to pull down their carryon bags and push their way out of the plane i tucked the mummy hand into my jeans pocket hoisted up my backpack and headed to the front i said goodbye to nancy and thanked her for all the peanuts then i followed the others down the long covered ramp and into the airport so many people and they all seemed to be in a hurry they were practically stepping over each other men in dark business suits women in looseflowing robes their faces covered by veils teenage girls in jeans and tshirts a group of dark seriouslooking men in silky white suits that looked like pajamas a family with three little kids all crying i had a sudden sinking feeling how would i ever find uncle ben in this crowd my backpack began to feel very heavy my eyes frantically searched back and forth strange voices surrounded me all talking so loudly no one was speaking english ow i cried out as i felt a sharp pain in my side i turned and realized that a woman had bumped me with her luggage cart stay calm gabe i instructed myself just stay calm uncle ben is here looking for you hell find you you just have to stay calm but what if my uncle forgot i asked myself what if he got mixed up about what day i was arriving or what if he got busy down in the pyramid and lost track of the time i can be a real worrier if i put my mind to it and right now i was worrying enough for three people if uncle ben isnt here ill go to a phone and call him i decided for sure i could just hear myself saying operator can i speak to my uncle at the pyramids please i dont think that would work too well i didnt have a phone number for uncle ben i wasnt sure he even had a phone out where he was staying all i knew was that he had been living in a tent somewhere near the pyramid where he was digging gazing frantically around the crowded arrival area i was just about to give in to total panic when a large man came walking up to me i couldnt see his face he wore a long white hooded robe its called a burnoose and his face was buried inside the hood taxi he asked in a high shrill voice taxi american taxi i burst out laughing uncle ben i cried happily taxi american taxi taxi ride he insisted uncle ben im so glad to see you i exclaimed i threw my arms around his waist and gave him a big hug then laughing at his stupid disguise i reached up and pulled back his hood the man under the hood had a bald shaved head and a heavy black mustache he glared at me furiously i had never seen him before in my life gabe gabe over here i heard a voice calling my name glancing past the angry man i saw uncle ben and sari they were waving to me from in front of the reservations counter the mans face turned bright red and he shouted something at me in arabic i was glad i couldnt understand him he kept muttering as he pulled up the hood of his burnoose sorry about that i cried then i dodged past him and hurried to greet uncle ben and my cousin uncle ben shook my hand and said welcome to cairo gabe he was wearing a loosefitting white shortsleeved sportshirt and baggy chinos sari wore faded denim cutoffs and a bright green tank top she was already laughing at me a bad start was that a friend of yours she teased i i made a mistake i confessed i glanced back the man was still scowling at me did you really think that was daddy sari demanded i mumbled a reply sari and i were the same age but i saw that she was still an inch taller than me she had let her black hair grow it fell down her back in a single braid her big dark eyes sparkled excitedly she loved making fun of me i told them about my flight as we walked to the baggage area to get my suitcase i told them how nancy the stewardess kept slipping me bags of peanuts i flew here last week sari told me the stewardess let me sit in first class did you know you can have an icecream sundae in first class no i didnt know that i could see that sari hadnt changed a bit she goes to a boarding school in chicago since uncle ben has been spending all of his time in egypt of course she gets straight as and shes a champion skier and tennis player sometimes i feel a little sorry for her her mom died when sari was five and sari only gets to see her dad on holidays and during the summer but as we waited for my suitcase to come out on the conveyor belt i wasnt feeling sorry for her at all she was busy bragging about how this pyramid was twice as big as the one id been in last summer and how shed already been down in it several times and how shed take me on a tour if i wasnt too afraid finally my bulging blue suitcase appeared i lugged it off the conveyor and dropped it at my feet it weighed a ton i tried to lift it but i could barely budge it sari pushed me out of the way let me get that she insisted she grabbed the handle raised the suitcase off the floor and started off with it hey i called after her what a showoff uncle ben grinned at me i think sari has been working out he said he put a hand on my shoulder and led me toward the glass doors lets get to the jeep we loaded the suitcase into the back of the jeep then headed toward the city its been sweltering hot during the day uncle ben told me mopping his broad forehead with a handkerchief and then cool at night traffic crawled on the narrow street horns honked constantly drivers kept their horns going whether they moved or stopped the noise was deafening were not stopping in cairo uncle ben explained were going straight to the pyramid at aljizah were all living in tents out there so we can be close to our work i hope you brought bug spray sari complained the mosquitoes are as big as frogs dont exaggerate uncle ben scolded gabe isnt afraid of a few mosquitoes are you no way i replied quietly how about scorpions sari demanded the traffic grew lighter as we left the city behind and headed into the desert the yellow sand gleamed under the hot afternoon sun waves of heat rose up in front of us as the jeep bumped over the narrow twolane road before long a pyramid came into view behind the waves of heat off the desert floor it looked like a wavering mirage it didnt seem real as i stared out at it my throat tightened with excitement i had seen the pyramids last summer but it was still a thrilling sight i cant believe the pyramids are over four thousand years old i exclaimed yeah thats even older than me uncle ben joked his expression turned serious it fills me with pride every time i see them gabe he admitted to think that our ancient ancestors were smart enough and skilled enough to build these marvels uncle ben was right i guess the pyramids have special meaning for me since my family is egyptian both sets of my grandparents came from egypt they moved to the united states around my mom and dad were born in michigan i think of myself as a typical american kid but theres still something exciting about visiting the country where your ancestors came from as we drove nearer the pyramid appeared to rise up in front of us its shadow formed a long blue triangle over the yellow sand cars and tour buses jammed a small parking lot i could see a row of saddled camels tethered on one side of the lot a crowd of tourists stretched across the sand gazing up at the pyramid snapping photographs chatting noisily and pointing uncle ben turned the jeep onto a narrow side road and we headed away from the crowd toward the back of the pyramid as we drove into the shade the air suddenly felt cooler id kill for an icecream cone sari wailed ive never been so hot in my life lets not talk about the heat uncle ben replied sweat dripping down his forehead into his bushy eyebrows lets talk about how happy you are to see your father after so many months sari groaned id be happier to see you if you were carrying an icecream cone uncle ben laughed a khakiuniformed guard stepped in front of the jeep uncle ben held up a blue id card the guard waved us past as we followed the road behind the pyramid a row of low white canvas tents came into view welcome to the pyramid hilton uncle ben joked thats our luxury suite over there he pointed to the nearest tent its pretty comfortable he said parking the jeep beside the tent but the room service is lousy and you have to watch out for scorpions sari warned shed say anything to try to scare me we unloaded my suitcase then uncle ben led us up to the base of the pyramid a camera crew was packing up its equipment a young man covered in dust climbed out of a low entrance dug into one of the limestone squares he waved to my uncle then hurried toward the tents one of my people uncle ben muttered he motioned toward the pyramid well here you are gabe a long way from michigan huh i nodded its amazing i told him shielding my eyes to gaze up to the top i forgot how much bigger the pyramids look in person tomorrow ill take you both down to the tomb uncle ben promised youve come at just the right time weve been digging for months and months and at long last we are about to break the seal and enter the tomb itself wow i exclaimed i wanted to be cool in front of sari but i couldnt help it i was really excited guess youll be really famous after you open the tomb huh dad sari asked she swatted a fly on her arm ow ill be so famous the flies will be afraid to bite you uncle ben replied by the way do you know what they called flies in ancient egypt sari and i shook our heads no i dont either uncle ben said grinning one of his dumb jokes he had an endless supply of them his expression suddenly changed oh that reminds me i have a present for you gabe a present now where did i put it he dug both hands into the pockets of his baggy chinos as he searched i saw something move behind him a shadow over my uncles shoulder back at the low opening to the pyramid i squinted at it the shadow moved a figure stepped out slowly at first i thought the sun was playing tricks on my eyes but as i squinted harder i realized that i was seeing correctly the figure stepped out from the pyramid its face was covered in worn yellowed gauze so were its arms and its legs i opened my mouth to cry out but my voice choked in my throat and as i struggled to alert my uncle the mummy stiffly stretched out its arms and came staggering up behind him i saw saris eyes grow wide with fright she let out a low gasp uncle ben i finally managed to scream turn around it it my uncle narrowed his eyes at me confused the mummy staggered closer its hands reaching out menacingly about to grab the back of uncle bens neck a mummy i shrieked uncle ben spun around he let out a startled cry it walks he shouted pointing at the mummy with a trembling finger he backed away as the mummy advanced it walks ohhh a strange moan escaped saris lips i turned and started to run but then the mummy burst out laughing it lowered its yellowed arms boo it cried and laughed again i turned and saw that uncle ben was laughing too his dark eyes sparkled gleefully it walks it walks he repeated shaking his head he put his arm around the mummys shoulder i gaped at the two of them my heart still pounding this is john uncle ben said enjoying the joke hed pulled on us hes been doing a tv commercial here for some new kind of stickier bandage sticky bird bandages john told us theyre just what your mummy ordered he and uncle ben enjoyed another good laugh at that then my uncle pointed to the camera crew packing their equipment into a small van they finished for the day but john agreed to hang around and help me scare you sari rolled her eyes nice try she said dryly youll have to do better than that daddy to frighten me and then she added poor gabe did you see his face he was so freaked out i thought he was going to spontaneously combust or something uncle ben and john laughed hey no way i insisted feeling my face turn red how could sari say that when the mummy staggered out i saw her gasp and back away she was just as scared as i was i heard you scream too i told her i didnt mean to sound so whiny i just did that to help them scare you sari insisted she tossed her long braid over her shoulder ive got to run john said glancing at his wristwatch as soon as we get back to the hotel im going to hit the pool i may stay underwater for a week he gave us a wave of his bandaged hand and went jogging to the van why hadnt i noticed that he was wearing a wristwatch i felt like a total dork thats it i cried angrily to my uncle im never falling for one of your dumb jokes again never he grinned at me and winked want to bet what about gabes present sari asked what is it uncle ben pulled something out of his pocket and held it up a pendant on a string made of clear orange glass it gleamed in the bright sunlight he handed it to me i moved it in my hand feeling its smoothness as i examined it what is it i asked him what kind of glass is this it isnt glass he replied its a clear stone called amber he stepped closer to examine it along with me hold it up and look inside the pendant i followed his instructions i saw a large brown bug inside it looks like some kind of beetle i said it is a beetle uncle ben said squinting one eye to see it better its an ancient beetle called a scarab it was trapped in the amber four thousand years ago as you can see its perfectly preserved thats really gross sari commented making a face she slapped uncle ben on the back great gift dad a dead bug remind me not to let you do our christmas shopping uncle ben laughed then he turned back to me the scarab was very important to the ancient egyptians he said rolling the amber pendant in his fingers then dropping it back in my palm they believed that scarabs were a symbol of immortality i stared at the bugs dark shell its six prickly legs perfectly preserved to keep a scarab meant immortality my uncle continued but the bite of a scarab meant instant death weird sari muttered its greatlooking i told him is it really four thousand years old he nodded wear it around your neck gabe maybe it still has some of its ancient powers i slipped the pendant over my head and adjusted it under my tshirt the amber stone felt cool against my skin thanks uncle ben i said its a great present he mopped his sweaty forehead with a waddedup handkerchief lets go back to the tent and get something cold to drink he said we took a few steps and then stopped when we saw saris face her entire body trembled her mouth dropped open as she pointed to my chest sari what is it uncle ben cried the sscarab she stammered it escaped i saw it she pointed down its there huh i spun away from her and bent down to find the scarab ow i cried out when i felt a sharp stab of pain on the back of my leg and realized the scarab had bitten me as i gasped in alarm uncle bens words about the scarab rushed through my mind to keep a scarab meant immortality but the bite of a scarab meant instant death instant death noooo i let out a howl and spun around and saw sari hunched down on her knees grinning her hand outstretched and realized she had pinched my leg my heart still pounding i grabbed the pendant and stared into the orange glassy stone the scarab was still frozen inside just as it had been for four thousand years aaaaaaaggh i let out a howl of rage i was mostly furious at myself was i going to fall for every dumb joke uncle ben and sari played on me this trip if so it was going to be a very long summer i had always liked my cousin except for the times when she was being so competitive and so superior we always got along really well but now i wanted to punch her i wanted to say really nasty things to her but i couldnt think of anything nasty enough that was really mean sari i said glumly tucking the pendant under my tshirt yes it was wasnt it she replied very pleased with herself that night i lay on my back on my narrow cot staring up at the low tent roof listening listening to the brush of the wind against the tent door the soft creak of the tent poles the flap of the canvas i dont think id ever felt so alert turning my head i could see the pale glow of moonlight through a crack in the tent door i could see blades of dried desert grass on the sand outside i could see water stains on the tent wall over my bed ill never get to sleep i thought unhappily i pushed and punched the flat pillow for the twentieth time trying to fluff it up the harsh wool blanket felt scratchy against my chin id slept away from home before but id always slept in a room of some kind not in the middle of a vast sandy desert in a tiny flapping creaking canvas tent i wasnt scared my uncle lay snoring away in his cot a few feet across the tent i was just alert very very alert so alert i could hear the swish of palm trees outside and i could hear the low hum of car tires miles away on the narrow road and i heard the thudding of my heart when something wriggled on my chest i was so alert i felt it instantly just a tickle a quick light move it could only be one thing the scarab moving inside the amber pendant no joke this time no joke it moved i fumbled for the pendant in the dark tossing down the blanket i held it up to the moonlight i could see the fat beetle in there black in its orange prison did you move i whispered to it did you wriggle your legs i suddenly felt really stupid why was i whispering to a fourthousandyearold insect why was i imagining that it was alive annoyed with myself i tucked the pendant back under my nightshirt i had no way of knowing how important that pendant would soon become to me i had no way of knowing that the pendant held a secret that would either save my life or kill me the tent was already hot when i awoke the next morning bright yellow sunlight poured in through the open tent flap squinting against the light i rubbed my eyes and stretched uncle ben had already gone out my back ached the little cot was so hard but i was too excited to worry about my back i was going down into the pyramid this morning to the entrance of an ancient tomb i pulled on a clean tshirt and the jeans id worn the day before i adjusted the scarab pendant under the tshirt then i carefully tucked the little mummy hand into the back pocket of my jeans with the pendant and the mummy hand im well protected i told myself nothing bad can happen this trip i pulled a hairbrush through my thick black hair a few times tugged my blackandyellow michigan wolverines cap on then i hurried to the mess tent to get some breakfast the sun was floating above the palm trees in the distance the yellow desert sand gleamed brightly i took a deep breath of fresh air yuck there must be some camels nearby i decided the air wasnt exactly fresh i found sari and uncle ben having their breakfast seated at the end of the long table in the mess tent uncle ben wore his usual baggy chinos and a shortsleeved white sportshirt with coffee stains down the front sari had her long black hair pulled straight back in a ponytail she wore a bright red tank top over white tennis shorts they greeted me as i entered the tent i poured myself a glass of orange juice and since i didnt see any frosted flakes filled a bowl with raisin bran three of uncle bens workers were eating at the other end of the table they were talking excitedly about their work we could go in today i heard one of them say it might take days to break the seal on the tomb door a young woman replied i sat down next to sari tell me all about the tomb i said to uncle ben whose tomb is it whats in there he chuckled let me say good morning before i launch into a lecture sari leaned over my cereal bowl hey look she said pointing i got a lot more raisins than you did i told you she could turn breakfast into a contest well i got more pulp in my orange juice i replied it was just a joke but she checked her juice glass to make sure uncle ben wiped his mouth with a paper napkin he took a long sip of black coffee if im not mistaken he began the tomb we have discovered here belonged to a prince actually a cousin of king tutankhamen thats king tut sari told me interrupting i know that i replied sharply king tuts tomb was discovered in uncle ben continued the vast burial chamber was filled with most of tuts treasures it was the most amazing archaeological discovery of the century a smile crossed his face until now do you think youve found something even more amazing i asked i hadnt touched my cereal i was too interested in my uncles story he shrugged theres no way of knowing whats behind the tomb door until we open it gabe but i have my fingers crossed i believe weve found the burial chamber of prince khorru he was the kings cousin and he was said to be as wealthy as the king and do you think all of prince khorrus crowns and jewels and belongings are buried with him sari asked uncle ben took the last sip of coffee and slid the white mug across the table who knows he replied there could be amazing treasures in there or it could be empty just an empty room how could it be empty i demanded why would there be an empty tomb in the pyramids grave robbers uncle ben replied frowning remember prince khorru was buried sometime around bc over the centuries thieves broke into the pyramids and robbed the treasures from many burial chambers he stood up and sighed we may have been digging for all these months only to find an empty room no way i cried excitedly ill bet we find the princes mummy in there and millions of dollars worth of jewels uncle ben smiled at me enough talk he said finish your breakfast so we can go find out sari and i followed uncle ben out of the tent he waved to two young men who came out of the supply tent carrying digging equipment then he hurried over to talk to them sari and i lingered back she turned to me a serious expression on her face hey gabe she said softly sorry ive been such a pain you a pain i replied sarcastically she didnt laugh im kind of worried she confessed about daddy i glanced at uncle ben he was slapping one of the young men on the back as he talked his usual jolly self why are you worried i asked sari your dad is in a great mood thats why im worried sari whispered hes so happy and excited he really thinks this is going to be the discovery that makes him famous so i demanded so what if it turns out to be an empty room sari replied her dark eyes watching her father what if grave robbers did strip the place or what if it isnt that princes tomb after all what if daddy breaks the seal opens the door and finds nothing but a dusty old room filled with snakes she sighed daddy will be heartbroken just heartbroken hes counting on this so much gabe i dont know if hell be able to take the disappointment why look on the gloomy side i replied what if i stopped because uncle ben was hurrying back to us lets go down to the chamber he said excitedly the workers think we are very close to uncovering the tomb entrance he put an arm on each of our shoulders and guided us to the pyramid as we stepped into the shade of the pyramid the air grew cooler the low entrance dug at the bottom of the back wall came into view it was just big enough for us to enter one at a time peering into the narrow hole i saw that the tunnel dropped steeply i hope i dont fall i thought a heavy knot of fear tightening my stomach i pictured myself falling and falling down an endless dark hole mainly i didnt want to fall in front of sari i knew shed never let me forget it uncle ben handed sari and me bright yellow hard hats they had lights built into them like miners hats stick close together he instructed i remember last summer you two wandered off and got us into a lot of trouble wwe wont i stammered i was trying not to sound nervous but i couldnt help it i glanced at sari she was adjusting the yellow hard hat over her hair she seemed as calm and confident as ever ill lead the way uncle ben said pulling the chin strap under his chin he turned and started to lower himself into the hole but a shrill cry from behind us made us all stop and turn around stop please stop dont go in a young woman came running across the sand her long black hair flew behind her head as she ran she carried a brown briefcase in one hand a camera strapped around her neck bobbed in front of her she stopped in front of us and smiled at uncle ben dr hassad she asked breathlessly my uncle nodded yes he waited for her to catch her breath wow shes really pretty i thought she had long black hair sleek and shiny she had bangs cut straight across her forehead beneath the bangs were the most beautiful green eyes id ever seen she was dressed all in white a white suit jacket and a white blouse over white slacks she was short only an inch or two taller than sari she must be a movie star or something i told myself shes so greatlooking she set her briefcase down on the sand and brushed back her long black hair im sorry i shouted like that dr hassad she told my uncle its just that i needed to talk to you i didnt want you to disappear into the pyramid uncle ben narrowed his eyes at her studying her how did you get past the security guard he asked pulling off the hard hat i showed them my press card she replied im a reporter for the cairo sun my name is nila rahmad i was hoping nila uncle ben interrupted what a pretty name she smiled yes my mother named me after the river of life the nile well its a very pretty name uncle ben replied his eyes twinkled but im not ready to have any reporters write about our work here nila frowned and bit her lower lip i spoke to dr fielding a few days ago she said my uncles eyes widened in surprise you did dr fielding gave me permission to write about your discovery nila insisted her green eyes locked on my uncle well we havent discovered anything yet uncle ben said sharply there may not be anything to discover thats not what dr fielding told me nila replied he seemed confident that you were about to make a discovery that would shock the world uncle ben laughed sometimes my partner gets excited and talks too much he told nila nilas eyes pleaded with my uncle may i come into the pyramid with you she glanced at sari and me i see you have other visitors my daughter sari and my nephew gabe uncle ben replied well could i come down with them nila pleaded i promise i wont write a word for my paper until you give me permission uncle ben rubbed his chin thoughtfully he swung the hard hat back onto his head no photographs either he muttered does that mean i can come nila asked excitedly uncle ben nodded as an observer he was trying to act real tough but i could see he liked her nila flashed him a warm smile thank you dr hassad he reached into the storage cart and handed her a yellow hard hat we wont be making any amazing discoveries today he warned her but were getting very close to something as she slipped on the heavy helmet nila turned to sari and me is this your first time in the pyramid she asked no way ive already been down three times sari boasted its really awesome i just arrived yesterday i said so its my first time down in i stopped when i saw nilas expression change why was she staring at me like that i glanced down and realized that she was staring at the amber pendant her mouth was open in shock no i dont believe this i really dont this is so weird she exclaimed whwhats wrong i stammered were twins nila declared she reached under her suit jacket and pulled out a pendant she wore around her neck an amber pendant shaped exactly like mine how unusual uncle ben exclaimed nila grasped my pendant between her fingers and lowered her face to examine it you have a scarab inside yours she told me turning the pendant around in her fingers she dropped mine and held hers up for me to see look gabe mine is empty i gazed into her pendant it looked like clear orange glass nothing inside i think yours is prettier sari told nila i wouldnt want to wear a dead bug around my neck but its supposed to be good luck or something nila replied she tucked the pendant back under her white jacket i hope it isnt bad luck to have an empty one i hope so too uncle ben commented dryly he turned and led us into the pyramid opening im not really sure how i got lost sari and i were walking together behind uncle ben and nila we were close behind them i could hear my uncle explaining about how the tunnel walls were granite and limestone our helmet lights were on the narrow beams of yellow light darted and crisscrossed over the dusty tunnel floor and walls as we made our way deeper and deeper into the pyramid the ceiling hung low and we all had to stoop as we walked the tunnel kept curving and there were several smaller tunnels that branched off false starts and dead ends uncle ben called them it was hard to see in the flickering light from our helmets i stumbled once and scraped my elbow against the rough tunnel wall it was surprisingly cool down here and i wished i had worn a sweatshirt or something up ahead uncle ben was telling nila about king tut and prince khorru it sounded to me as if uncle ben was trying to impress her i wondered if he had a crush on her or something this is so thrilling i heard nila exclaim it was so nice of dr fielding and you to let me see it who is dr fielding i whispered to sari my fathers partner sari whispered back but daddy doesnt like him youll probably meet him hes always around i dont like him much either i stopped to examine a strangelooking marking on the tunnel wall it was shaped like some kind of animal head sari look i whispered an ancient drawing sari rolled her eyes its bart simpson she muttered one of daddys workers must have drawn it there i knew that i lied i was just testing you when was i going to stop making a fool of myself in front of my cousin i turned back from the stupid drawing on the wall and sari had vanished i could see the narrow beam of light from her hard hat up ahead hey wait up i called but the light disappeared as the tunnel curved away and then i stumbled again my helmet hit the tunnel wall and the light went out hey sari uncle ben i called to them i leaned heavily against the wall afraid to move in the total darkness hey can anybody hear me my voice echoed down the narrow tunnel but no one replied i pulled off the hard hat and fiddled with the light i turned it trying to tighten it then i shook the whole hat but the light wouldnt come back on sighing i strapped the hat back onto my head now what i thought starting to feel a little afraid my stomach began fluttering my throat suddenly felt dry hey can anybody hear me i shouted im in the dark back here i cant walk no reply where were they didnt they notice that i had disappeared well ill just wait right here for them i murmured to myself i leaned my shoulder against the tunnel wall and fell right through the wall no way to catch my balance nothing to grab on to i was falling falling down through total darkness my hands flailed wildly as i fell i reached out frantically for something to grab on to it all happened too fast to cry out i landed hard on my back pain shot out through my arms and legs the darkness swirled around me my breath was knocked right out of me i saw bright flashes of red then everything went black again i struggled to breathe but couldnt suck in any air i had that horrible heavy feeling in my chest like when a basketball hits you in the stomach finally i sat up struggling to see in the total darkness i heard a soft shuffling sound something scraping over the hard dirt floor hey can anyone hear me my voice came out a hoarse whisper now my back ached but i was starting to breathe normally hey im down here i called a little louder no reply didnt they miss me werent they looking for me i was leaning back on my hands starting to feel better my right hand started to itch i reached to scratch it and brushed something away and realized my legs were itching too and felt something crawling on my left wrist i shook my hand hard whats going on here i whispered to myself my entire body tingled i felt soft pinpricks up my arms and legs shaking both arms i jumped to my feet and banged my helmet against a low ledge the light flickered on i gasped when i saw the crawling creatures in the narrow beam of light spiders hundreds of bulby white spiders thick on the chamber floor they scuttled across the floor climbing over each other as i jerked my head up and the light swept up with it i saw that the stone walls were covered with them too the white spiders made the wall appear to move as if it were alive spiders hung on invisible threads from the chamber ceiling they seemed to bob and float in midair i shook one off the back of my hand and with a gasp realized why my legs itched spiders were crawling all over them up over my arms down my back help somebody please i managed to cry out i felt a spider drop on to the top of my head i brushed it away with a frantic slap somebody help me i screamed can anyone hear me and then i saw something scarier much scarier a snake slid down from above me lowering itself rapidly toward my face i ducked and tried to cover my head as the snake silently dropped toward me grab it i heard someone call grab on to it with a startled cry i raised my eyes the light beam followed and i saw that it was not a snake that stretched from above but a rope grab on to it gabe hurry sari shouted urgently from high above brushing away spiders kicking frantically to shake the spiders off my sneakers i grasped the rope with both hands and felt myself being tugged up pulled up through the darkness to the tunnel floor above a few seconds later uncle ben reached down and grabbed me under the shoulders as he hoisted me up i could see sari and nila pulling with all their might on the rope i cheered happily as my feet touched solid ground but i didnt have long to celebrate my entire body felt as if it were on fire i went wild kicking my legs brushing spiders off my arms scratching spiders off my back stamping on the spiders as they scuttled off me glancing up i saw that sari was laughing at me gabe what do you call that dance she asked uncle ben and nila laughed too how did you fall down there gabe my uncle demanded peering down into the spider chamber the wall it gave way i told him frantically scratching my legs i thought you were still with me sari explained when i turned around her voice trailed off the light on uncle bens helmet beamed down to the lower chamber thats a long fall uncle ben said turning back to me are you sure youre okay i nodded yeah i guess it knocked the wind out of me and then the spiders there must be hundreds of chambers like that my uncle commented glancing at nila the pyramid builders made a maze of tunnels and chambers to fool tomb robbers and keep them from finding the real tomb yuck such fat spiders sari groaned stepping back there are millions of them down there i told her on the walls hanging from the ceiling everywhere this is going to give me bad dreams nila said softly moving closer to uncle ben you sure youre okay my uncle demanded again i started to reply then i suddenly remembered something the mummy hand it was tucked in my back pocket had it been crushed when i landed on it my heart skipped a beat i didnt want anything bad to happen to that little hand it was my good luck charm i reached into my jeans pocket and pulled it out holding it under the light from my hard hat i examined it carefully i breathed a sigh of relief when i saw that it was okay it still felt cold but it hadnt been crushed whats that nila asked leaning closer to see it better she brushed her long hair away from her face is that the summoner how did you know that i demanded holding the hand up so she could see it better nila stared at it intently i know a lot about ancient egypt she replied ive studied it my whole life it might be an ancient relic uncle ben broke in or it might just be a tacky souvenir sari added it has real powers i insisted brushing it off carefully i landed on it down there i pointed to the spider chamber and it didnt get crushed i guess it is a good luck charm nila said turning back to uncle ben then why didnt it keep gabe from falling through that wall sari cracked before i could answer i saw the mummy hand move the tiny fingers slowly curled out and then in i cried out and nearly dropped it gabe now what uncle ben demanded sharply uh nothing i replied they wouldnt believe me anyway i think weve done enough exploring for now uncle ben said as we made our way to the entrance i held the mummy hand in front of me i wasnt seeing things i knew that for sure the fingers really had moved but why was the hand trying to signal me was it trying to warn me about something two days later uncle bens workers reached the doorway to the burial chamber sari and i had spent the two days hanging around in the tent or exploring the area outside the pyramid since it was mostly sand there wasnt much to explore we spent one long afternoon playing game after game of scrabble playing scrabble with sari wasnt much fun at all she was a very defensive player and spent hours figuring out ways to clog the board and block me from getting any good words whenever i put down a really good word sari claimed it wasnt a real word and couldnt be allowed and since we didnt have a dictionary in the tent she won most of the arguments uncle ben meanwhile seemed really stressed out i thought maybe he was nervous about finally opening the tomb he barely spoke to sari and me instead he spent a lot of time meeting with people i didnt recognize he seemed very serious and businesslike none of his usual backslapping and joking uncle ben also spent a lot of time talking with nila at first shed said she wanted to write about his discovery in the pyramid but now shed decided to write an article about him she wrote down nearly every word he said in a little pad she carried with her then at breakfast he finally smiled for the first time in two days todays the day he announced sari and i couldnt hide our excitement are you taking us with you i asked uncle ben nodded i want you to be there he replied perhaps we will make history today perhaps it will be a day you will want to remember for the rest of your lives he shrugged and added thoughtfully perhaps a few minutes later the three of us followed several workers across the sand toward the pyramid it was a gray day heavy clouds hovered low in the sky threatening rain the pyramid rose up darkly to meet the clouds as we approached the small opening in the back wall nila came running up her camera bobbing in front of her she wore a longsleeved blue denim work shirt over loosefitting faded jeans uncle ben greeted her warmly but still no photographs he told her firmly promise nila smiled back at him her green eyes lit up excitedly she raised a hand to her heart promise we all took yellow hard hats from the equipment dump uncle ben was carrying a large stone mallet he lowered himself into the entrance and we followed my heart was racing as i hurried to keep up with sari the lights from our helmets darted over the narrow tunnel far up ahead i could hear the voices of workers and the steady scrape of their digging tools this is really awesome i exclaimed breathlessly to sari maybe the tomb is filled with jewels sari whispered as we made our way around a curve sapphires and rubies and emeralds maybe ill get to try on a jeweled crown worn by an egyptian princess do you think theres a mummy in the tomb i asked i wasnt too interested in jewels do you think the mummified body of prince khorru is lying there waiting to be discovered sari made a disgusted face is that all you can think about mummies well we are in an ancient egyptian pyramid i shot back there could be millions of dollars worth of jewels and relics in that tomb sari scolded and all you can think about is some moldy old body wrapped up in tar and gauze she shook her head you know most kids get over their fascination with mummies by the time theyre eight or nine uncle ben didnt i replied that shut her up we followed nila and uncle ben in silence after a while the narrow tunnel curved up sharply the air grew warmer as we followed it up i could see lights ahead two batterypowered spotlights were trained on the far wall as we drew closer i realized it wasnt a wall it was a door four workers two men and two women were on their knees working with small shovels and picks they were scraping the last chunks of dirt away from the door it looks beautiful uncle ben cried running up to the workers they turned to greet him its awesome in the true sense of the word he declared nila sari and i stepped up behind him uncle ben was right the ancient door really was awesome it wasnt very tall i could see that uncle ben would have to stoop to step into it but it looked like a door fit for a prince the dark mahogany wood now petrified must have been brought from far away i knew that kind of wood didnt come from any trees that grew in egypt strange hieroglyphics covered the door from top to bottom i recognized birds and cats and other animals etched deeply into the dark wood the most startling sight of all was the seal that locked the door a snarling lions head sculpted in gold the light from the spotlights made the lion glow like the sun the gold is soft i heard one of the workers tell my uncle the seal will break away easily uncle ben lowered his heavy mallet to the ground he stared for a long moment at the glowing lions head then turned back to us they thought this lion would scare any intruders away from the tomb he explained i guess it worked till now dr hassad i have to photograph the actual breaking of the seal nila said stepping up beside him you really must let me we cant let the moment go unrecorded he gazed at her thoughtfully well okay he agreed a pleased smile crossed her face as she raised her camera thanks ben the workers stepped back one of them handed uncle ben a hammer and a delicate tool that looked like a doctors scalpel its all yours dr hassad she said uncle ben raised the tools and stepped up to the seal once i break this seal we will open the door and step into a room that hasnt been seen in four thousand years he announced nila steadied her camera over her eye carefully adjusting the lens sari and i moved up beside the workers the gold lion appeared to glow brighter as uncle ben raised the tool a hush fell over the tunnel i could feel the excitement feel the tension in the air such suspense i realized i had been holding my breath i let it out in a long silent whoosh and took another i glanced at sari she was nervously chewing her lower lip her hands were pressed tightly at her sides anyone hungry maybe we should forget about this and send out for a pizza uncle ben joked we all laughed loudly that was uncle ben for you cracking a dumb joke at what might be the most exciting moment of his life the tense silence returned uncle bens expression turned serious he turned back to the ancient seal he raised the small chisel to the back of the seal then he started to lift the hammer and a booming voice rang out please let me rest in peace i let out a startled cry let me rest in peace the booming voice repeated i saw uncle ben lower his chisel he spun around his eyes wide with surprise i realized the voice came from behind us i turned to see a man i had never seen before half hidden in the shadowy tunnel he made his way toward us taking long steady strides he was a tall lanky man so tall he really had to hunch his shoulders in the low tunnel bald except for a fringe of dark hair at the ears he had a slender face an unfriendly scowl on his thin lips he wore a perfectly ironed safari jacket over a shirt and necktie his black eyes like little raisins glared at my uncle i wondered if the man ever ate he was as skinny as a mummy himself omar uncle ben started i wasnt expecting you back from cairo let me rest in peace dr fielding repeated softer this time those are the words of prince khorru written on the ancient stone we found last month that was the princes wish omar weve been over this before my uncle replied sighing he lowered the hammer and chisel to his sides dr fielding pushed past sari and me as if we werent there he stopped in front of my uncle and swept a hand back over his bald head well then how can you dare to break the seal dr fielding demanded i am a scientist my uncle replied slowly speaking each word clearly and distinctly i cannot allow superstition to stand in the way of discovery omar i am also a scientist dr fielding replied using both hands to tighten his necktie but i am not willing to defile this ancient tomb i am not willing to go against the wishes of prince khorru and i am not willing to call the words of the hieroglyph mere superstition this is where we disagree uncle ben said softly he motioned to the four workers we have spent too many months too many years to stop just outside the door we have come this far omar we must go the rest of the way dr fielding chewed his lower lip he pointed to the top of the door look ben there are the same hieroglyphs as on the stone the same warning let me rest in peace i know i know my uncle said frowning the warning is very clear dr fielding continued heatedly his tiny raisin eyes narrowed at my uncle if anyone should disturb the prince if anyone should repeat the ancient words written on the tomb five times the mummified prince shall come to life and he shall seek his vengeance on those who disturbed him listening to those words made me shudder i stared hard at uncle ben why hadnt he ever told sari and me about the princes threat why hadnt he ever mentioned the words of warning they had found on an ancient stone was he afraid he might frighten us was he frightened himself no no way he didnt seem at all frightened now as he argued with dr fielding i could tell they had had this argument before and i could see there was no way that dr fielding was going to stop my uncle from breaking the seal and entering the tomb this is my final warning ben dr fielding said for the sake of everyone here he motioned with one hand to the four workers superstition uncle ben replied i cannot be stopped by superstition i am a scientist he raised the chisel and hammer the seal will be broken dr fielding tossed up both hands in disgust i will not be a party to this he declared he spun around nearly hitting his head on the tunnel ceiling then muttering to himself he hurried away disappearing quickly into the darkness of the tunnel uncle ben took a couple of steps after him omar omar but we could hear dr fieldings footsteps growing fainter as he made his way out of the pyramid uncle ben sighed and leaned close to me i dont trust that man he muttered he doesnt really care about the old superstitions he wants to steal this discovery for himself thats why he tried to make me stop outside the door i didnt know how to reply my uncles words startled me i thought scientists had rules about who took credit for what discoveries uncle ben whispered something to nila then he made his way back to the four workers if any of you agree with dr fielding he told them you are free to leave now the workers exchanged glances with one another you have all heard the words of warning on the tomb door i do not want to force anyone to enter the tomb uncle ben told them but we have worked so hard one of the men said we cannot stop here we have no choice we have to open that door a smile crossed my uncles face i agree he said turning back to the lion seal i glanced at sari and realized that she was already staring at me gabe if youre scared daddy will let you leave she whispered you dont have to be embarrassed she never quits im staying i whispered back but if you want me to walk you back to the tent i will a loud clink made us both turn back to the door uncle ben was working to pry off the gold lion seal nila had her camera poised the workers stood tensely watching uncle bens every move uncle ben worked slowly carefully he slid the chisel behind the ancient seal and gently pried and scraped a few minutes later the seal fell into my uncles hands nila busily snapped photograph after photograph uncle ben carefully passed it to one of the workers thats not a christmas gift he joked im keeping that for my mantelpiece everyone laughed uncle ben gripped the edge of the door with both hands im going in first he announced if im not back in twenty minutes go tell dr fielding he was right more laughter two of the workers moved to help uncle ben slide open the door they pressed their shoulders against it straining hard the door didnt budge it might need a little oiling uncle ben joked after all its been closed for four thousand years they worked for several minutes with picks and chisels carefully freeing the door then they tried once again pressing their shoulders against the heavy mahogany door yes uncle ben cried out as the door slid an inch then another inch another inch everyone pressed forward eager to get a view of the ancient tomb two of the workers moved the large spotlights aiming them into the doorway as uncle ben and his two helpers pushed against the door sari and i stepped up beside nila isnt this amazing nila cried excitedly i cant believe im the only reporter here im so lucky im lucky too i realized how many kids would give anything to be standing right where i am how many kids would love to be one of the first people in the world to step into a fourthousandyearold tomb in an egyptian pyramid the faces of some of my friends back home suddenly popped into my mind i realized i couldnt wait to tell them about my adventure here the door scraped noisily against the dirt floor another inch another inch the opening was almost big enough for a person to squeeze through move the light a little uncle ben instructed another few inches and we can go in and shake hands with the prince the door scraped open another inch with a great heave uncle ben and his helpers forced it open another few inches yes he cried happily nila snapped a photograph we all pressed forward eagerly uncle ben slid through the opening first sari bumped me out of the way and cut in front of me my heart was pounding hard my hands were suddenly ice cold i didnt care who went in first i just wanted to go in one by one we slipped into the ancient chamber finally my turn came i took a deep breath slipped through the opening and saw nothing except for a lot of cobwebs the chamber was bare totally bare i let out a long sigh poor uncle ben all that work for nothing i felt so disappointed i glanced around the bare chamber the spotlights made the thick cobwebs glow like silver our shadows stretched across the dirt floor like ghosts i turned to uncle ben expecting him to be disappointed too but to my surprise he had a smile on his face move the lights he told one of the workers and bring the tools we have another seal to remove he pointed across the empty room to the back wall in the gray light i could make out the outline of a door another sculpted lion sealed it shut i knew this wasnt the real burial chamber sari cried grinning at me as i said the egyptians often did this uncle ben explained they built several false chambers to hide the real chamber from grave robbers he pulled off his hard hat and scratched his hair in fact he continued we may find several empty chambers before we find prince khorrus resting place nila snapped a photo of uncle ben examining the newly discovered door she smiled at me you should have seen the expression on your face gabe she said you looked so disappointed i thought i started but the scrape of uncle bens chisel against the seal made me stop we all turned to watch him work at the seal staring across the cobwebfilled chamber i tried to imagine what waited for us on the other side of the door another empty chamber or a fourthousandyearold egyptian prince surrounded by all of his treasures and belongings work on the door went slowly we all broke for lunch and then returned that afternoon uncle ben and his helpers worked for another couple of hours carefully trying to remove the seal without damaging it as they worked sari and i sat on the floor and watched the air was hot and kind of sour i guess it was ancient air sari and i talked about last summer and the adventures wed had in the great pyramid nila snapped our picture almost got it uncle ben announced we all started to get excited again sari and i climbed to our feet and crossed the room to get a better view the lion seal slid free from the door two of the workers placed it gently into a padded crate then uncle ben and the other two workers set to work pushing open the door this door proved even more difficult than the last its really stuck uncle ben groaned he and the workers pulled out more tools and began prying and chipping away the hard crust that had formed on the doorway over the centuries an hour later they got the door to slide an inch then another inch another when it had slid halfway open uncle ben removed the light from his helmet and beamed it through the opening he peered into the next chamber for the longest time without saying a word sari and i moved closer my heart began racing again what did he see i wondered what was he staring at so silently finally uncle ben lowered the light and turned back to us weve made a big mistake he said quietly a shocked silence fell over the room i swallowed hard stunned by my uncles words but then a broad smile crossed his face we made a mistake by underestimating our discovery he exclaimed this will be more important than the discovery of king tut this tomb is even grander a gleeful cheer echoed against the stone walls the workers rushed forward to shake uncle bens hand and offer their congratulations congratulations to us all uncle ben declared happily we were all laughing and talking excitedly as we slipped through the narrow opening into the next chamber as the lights beamed over the vast room i knew i was seeing something i would never forget even the thick layer of dust and cobwebs could not cover the amazing treasures that filled the chamber my eyes darted quickly around i struggled to focus on it all but there was too much to see i actually felt dizzy the walls were covered from floor to ceiling with hieroglyphics etched into the stone the floor was cluttered with furniture and other objects it looked more like someones attic or a storeroom than a tomb a tall straightbacked throne caught my eye it had a golden radiating sun etched into the seatback behind it i saw chairs and benches and a long couch against the wall were stacked dozens of stone and clay jars some were cracked and broken but many were in perfect condition a gold monkey head lay on its side in the middle of the floor behind it i saw several large chests uncle ben and one of the workers carefully pulled back the lid of one of the chests their eyes grew wide as they gaped inside jewelry uncle ben declared its filled with gold jewelry sari came up beside me an excited grin on her face this is awesome i whispered she nodded agreement awesome we whispered in the heavy silence no one else talked everyone was too overwhelmed by the amazing sight the loudest sound was the clicking of nilas camera uncle ben stepped between sari and me and placed a hand on our shoulders isnt this unbelievable he cried its all in perfect condition untouched for four thousand years when i glanced up at him i saw that he had tears in his eyes this is the greatest moment of uncle bens life i realized we must be very careful uncle ben started but he stopped in midsentence and i saw his expression change as he guided sari and me across the room i saw what he was staring at a large stone mummy case hidden in shadow stood against the far wall oh wow i murmured as we stepped up to it made of smooth gray stone the heavy lid had a long crack down the center is the prince buried inside it sari asked eagerly it took uncle ben a moment to reply he stood between us his eyes locked on the ancient mummy case well soon see he finally replied as he and the four workers struggled to move the lid nila lowered her camera and stepped forward to watch her green eyes stared intensely as the lid slowly slid away inside was a coffin in the shape of the mummy it wasnt very long and it was narrower than i thought it would be the workers slowly pried open the coffins lid i gasped and grabbed uncle bens hand as the mummy was revealed it looked so tiny and frail prince khorru uncle ben muttered staring down into the stone case the prince lay on his back his slender arms crossed over his chest black tar had seeped through the bandages the gauze had worn away from the head revealing the tarcovered skull as i leaned over the case my heart in my throat the tarblackened eyes seemed to stare helplessly up at me theres a real person inside there i thought feeling a chill run down my spine hes about my size and he died and they covered him with hot tar and cloth and hes been lying in this case for four thousand years a real person a royal prince i stared at the stained cracked tar that covered his face at the gauzelike cloth all frayed and yellowed at the stiff body so frail and small he was alive once i thought did he ever dream that four thousand years later people would open his coffin and stare at him stare at his mummified body i took a step back to catch my breath it was too exciting i saw that nila also had tears in her eyes she rested both hands on the edge of the case and leaned over the princes body her eyes locked on the blackened face these may be the bestpreserved remains ever found uncle ben said quietly of course we will have to do many tests to determine the young mans identity but judging from everything else in this chamber i think its safe to say his voice trailed off as we all heard sounds from the outer chamber footsteps voices i spun around toward the doorway as four blackuniformed police officers burst into the room okay everybody take one step back one of them ordered lowering his hand to the gun holster at his side startled cries filled the room uncle ben spun around his eyes wide with surprise what is happening he cried the four cairo police officers their features set in hard frowns moved quickly into the center of the room be careful uncle ben warned standing in front of the mummy case as if protecting it do not move anything it is all terribly fragile he pulled off the hard hat his eyes went from officer to officer what are you doing here i asked them to come a voice boomed from the doorway dr fielding entered a pleased expression on his face his tiny eyes danced excitedly omar i dont understand uncle ben said taking a few steps toward the other scientist i thought it best to protect the contents of the room dr fielding replied he gazed quickly around the room taking in the treasures wonderful this is wonderful he cried he stepped forward and shook my uncles hand enthusiastically congratulations everyone he boomed this is almost too much to believe uncle bens expression softened i still do not understand the need for them he said motioning to the grimfaced officers no one in this room is about to steal anything certainly not dr fielding replied still squeezing uncle bens hand certainly not but word will soon get out ben and i thought we should be prepared to guard what we have found uncle ben eyed the four officers suspiciously but then he shrugged his broad shoulders perhaps you are right he told dr fielding perhaps you are being smart just ignore them dr fielding replied he slapped my uncle on the back i owe you an apology ben i was wrong to try to stop you before as a scientist i should have known better we owed it to the world to open this tomb i hope youll forgive me we have much to celebrate dont we i dont trust him uncle ben confided that evening as we walked from the tent to dinner i dont trust my partner at all it was a clear night surprisingly cool the purple sky was dotted with a million twinkling white stars a steady breeze made the palm trees sway on the horizon the big campfire up ahead dipped and shifted with the wind is dr fielding coming with us to dinner sari asked she wore a pale green sweater pulled down over black leggings uncle ben shook his head no he hurried to phone cairo i think hes eager to tell our backers the good news he seemed really excited when he saw the mummy and everything i said glancing at the pyramid rising darkly to the evening sky yes he did my uncle admitted he certainly changed his mind in a hurry but im keeping my eye on him omar would like nothing better than to take over the project im going to keep an eye on those police officers of his too daddy this should be a happy night sari scolded lets not talk about dr fielding lets just talk about prince khorru and how youre going to be rich and famous uncle ben laughed its a deal he told her nila waited for us by the campfire uncle ben had invited her to join us for a barbecue she wore a white sweatshirt over loosefitting jeans her amber pendant caught the light from the halfmoon just rising over the tents she looked really pretty she flashed uncle ben a warm smile as we came near i could tell by his face that he liked her sari youre taller than gabe arent you nila commented sari grinned she loved being taller than me even though im a little older less than an inch i said quickly people are definitely getting taller nila said to my uncle prince khorru was so short hed be a midget today it makes you wonder why such short people built such tall pyramids uncle ben said grinning nila smiled and took his arm sari and i exchanged glances i could see what sari was thinking her expression said whats up with those two we had a great dinner uncle ben burned the hamburger rolls a little but no one really minded sari downed two hamburgers i could only eat one that gave her something else to boast about i was really getting fed up with my bragging cousin i found myself trying to think of a way to get back at her nila and uncle ben kidded around a lot that burial chamber looked like a movie set nila teased my uncle it was all too perfect all that gold and that perfect little mummy its all a fake thats what im going to write in my article uncle ben laughed he turned to me did you check out the mummy gabe was this one wearing a wristwatch i shook my head no wristwatch see uncle ben told nila no wristwatch so its got to be real i guess that proves it nila said smiling warmly at my uncle daddy do you know the words to bring the mummy to life sari broke in you know the words on the tomb that dr fielding was talking about uncle ben swallowed the last bite of his hamburger he wiped the grease off his chin with a napkin i cant believe that a serious scientist would believe such superstition he murmured but what are the six words to bring the mummy to life nila demanded come on ben tell us uncle bens smile faded he shook his finger at nila oh no he declared i dont trust you if i tell you the words youll bring the mummy back to life just to get a good photograph for your newspaper we all laughed we were sitting around the campfire its orange light flickering over our faces uncle ben set his plate down on the ground and spread his hands over the fire teki kahru teki kahra teki khari he chanted in a deep voice waving his hands over the flames the fire crackled a twig made a loud popping sound that made my heart skip a beat are those the secret words sari demanded uncle ben nodded solemnly those are the words of the hieroglyphs over the entrance to the tomb so maybe the mummy just sat up and stretched sari asked id be very surprised uncle ben replied climbing to his feet youre forgetting sari you have to chant the words five times oh sari stared thoughtfully into the fire i repeated the words in my mind teki kahru teki kahra teki khari i needed to memorize the words i had a plan to scare sari where are you going nila asked my uncle to the communications tent he replied i have to make a phone call he turned and made his way quickly over the sand toward the row of canvas tents nila let out a surprised laugh he didnt even say goodnight daddys always like that sari explained when he has something on his mind guess id better go too nila said climbing to her feet and brushing sand off her jeans im going to start writing my story for the paper she said good night and walked quickly away her sandals making a slapping sound against the sand sari and i sat staring into the crackling fire the halfmoon had floated high in the sky its pale light reflected off the top of the pyramid in the distance nila is right i told sari it really did look like a movie set in there sari didnt reply she stared into the fire without blinking thinking hard something in the fire popped again the sound seemed to snap her out of her thoughts do you think nila likes daddy she asked me her dark eyes locking on mine yeah i guess i replied shes always giving him this smile i imitated nilas smile and shes always kind of teasing him sari thought about my reply and do you think daddy likes her i grinned for sure i stood up i was eager to get back to the tent i wanted to scare sari we walked toward the tents in silence i guessed that sari was still thinking about her dad and nila the night air was cool but it was warm inside the tent moonlight filtered through the canvas sari pulled her trunk out from under her cot and got down on her knees to search through her clothes sari i whispered dare me to recite the ancient words five times huh she gazed up from the trunk im going to chant the words five times i told her you know see if anything happens i expected her to beg me not to i expected her to get scared and plead please gabe dont do it dont its too dangerous but instead sari turned back to her clothes trunk hey give it a try she told me you sure i asked her yeah why not she replied pulling out a pair of denim cutoffs i stared across the tent at her was that fear i saw in her eyes was she just pretending to be so casual about it yes i think sari was a little scared and trying hard not to show it i took a few steps closer and chanted the ancient words in the same low voice uncle ben had used teki kahru teki kahra teki khari sari dropped the jeans and turned to watch me i repeated the chant a second time teki kahru teki kahra teki khari a third time a fourth time i hesitated i felt a cold breeze tingle the back of my neck should i chant the words again should i go for number five i stared down at sari she had closed the trunk lid and was leaning on it tensely staring back at me i could see that she was frightened she chewed her bottom lip should i chant the words for a fifth time i felt another chill at the back of my neck its just superstition i told myself fourthousandyearold superstition theres no way that moldy old mummified prince is going to come back to life just because i recite six words i dont even know the meaning of no way i suddenly thought of all the old movies i had rented about mummies in ancient egypt in the movies the scientists always ignored ancient curses warning them not to disturb the mummies tombs then the mummies always came to life to get their revenge they staggered around grabbed the scientists by the throat and strangled them dumb movies but i loved them now staring down at sari i saw that she was really scared i took a deep breath i suddenly realized that i felt scared too but it was too late i had gone too far i couldnt chicken out now teki kahru teki kahra teki khari i shouted the fifth time i froze and waited i dont know what i expected a flash of lightning maybe sari climbed to her feet she tugged at a strand of dark hair admit it youre totally freaked i said unable to keep a grin from spreading across my face no way she insisted go ahead gabe chant the words again chant them a hundred times youre not going to scare me no way but we both gasped when we suddenly saw a dark shadow roll over the tent wall and my heart completely stopped when a hoarse voice whispered into the tent are you in there my legs trembled as i stumbled back closer to sari i could see her eyes go wide with surprise and fear the shadow moved quickly toward the tent opening we had no time to scream no time to call for help gaping into the darkness i saw the flap pull open and a smooth head poked into the tent ohhh i let out a terrified moan as the dark figure slumped toward us the mummy is alive the horrifying thought swept through my mind as i backed away the mummy is alive dr fielding sari cried huh i squinted to see better yes it was dr fielding i struggled to say hello but my heart was pounding so hard i couldnt speak i took a long deep breath and held it im looking for your father dr fielding told sari i must see him at once its extremely urgent he hes making a phone call sari replied in a shaky voice dr fielding spun around and ducked out of the tent the flap snapped shut behind him i turned to sari my heart still pounding he scared me to death i confessed i thought he was in cairo when he poked that skinny bald head into the tent sari laughed he really looks like a mummy doesnt he her smile faded i wonder why hes in such a hurry to see daddy lets follow him i urged the idea just popped into my head yes lets go i hadnt expected sari to agree so quickly but she was already pushing open the tent flap i followed her out of the tent the night had grown cooler a steady wind made all of the tents appear to shiver which way did he go i whispered sari pointed i think thats the communications tent at the end she started jogging across the sand as we ran the wind blew sand against our legs i heard music and voices from one of the tents the workers were celebrating the days discovery the moon cast a strip of light like a carpet along our path up ahead i could see dr fieldings lanky body leaning forward lurching awkwardly toward the last tent he disappeared around the side of it sari and i stopped a few tents away we ducked out of the moonlight into deep shadows where we wouldnt be seen i could hear dr fieldings booming voice from the communications tent he was talking rapidly excitedly what is he saying sari whispered i couldnt make out the words a few seconds later two figures emerged from the tent carrying bright flashlights they crossed the strip of yellow moonlight then moved quickly into shadow dr fielding appeared to be pulling uncle ben pulling him toward the pyramid whats going on sari whispered grabbing my sleeve is he forcing daddy to go with him the wind swirled the sand around us i shivered the two men were talking at the same time shouting and gesturing with their flashlights theyre arguing about something i realized dr fielding had a hand on uncle bens shoulder was he shoving uncle ben toward the pyramid or was uncle ben actually leading the way it was impossible to tell lets go i whispered to sari we stepped away from the tent and started to follow them we walked slowly keeping them in view but being careful not to get too close if they turn back theyll see us sari whispered huddling close to me as we crept over the sand she was right there were no trees or bushes to hide behind here in the open desert maybe they wont turn back i replied hopefully we crept closer the pyramid rose up darkly in front of us we saw dr fielding and uncle ben stop at the opening in the side i could hear their excited voices but the wind carried away their words they still seemed to be arguing uncle ben disappeared into the pyramid first dr fielding went in right behind him did he shove daddy in sari demanded in a shrill frightened voice it looked like he pushed him inside i i dont know i stammered we made our way closer to the entrance then we both stopped and stared into the darkness i knew we were both thinking the same thing i knew we both had the same question on our lips should we follow them in sari and i exchanged glances the pyramid seemed so much bigger at night so much darker the gusting wind howled around its walls as if warning us to stay back we crept behind a pile of stones left by the workers lets wait out here for daddy to come out sari suggested i didnt argue with her we had no flashlights no light of any kind i didnt think wed get very far wandering the dark tunnels by ourselves i pressed up against the smooth stones and stared at the pyramid opening sari gazed up at the halfmoon thin wisps of cloud floated over it the ground darkened in front of us you dont think daddy is in any kind of trouble do you sari asked i mean he told us he didnt trust dr fielding and then im sure uncle ben is okay i told her i mean dr fielding is a scientist hes not a criminal or anything but why did he force daddy into the pyramid in the middle of the night sari asked shrilly and what were they arguing about i shrugged in reply i didnt remember ever seeing sari so frightened normally i would have enjoyed it she always bragged about how brave and fearless she was especially compared to me but there was no way i could enjoy this mainly because i was just as scared as she was it did look as if the two scientists were fighting and it did look as if dr fielding pushed uncle ben down into the pyramid sari crossed her arms over her sweater again and narrowed her eyes at the opening the wind fluttered her hair blowing strands across her forehead but she made no attempt to brush them away what could be so important she demanded why did they have to go into the pyramid now do you think something was stolen arent those police officers from cairo down there guarding the place i saw the four policemen leave i told her they piled into their little car and drove away just before dinner i dont know why maybe they were called back to the city i im just so confused sari admitted and worried i didnt like the look on dr fieldings face i didnt like the way he was so rude just bursting into the tent like that scaring us to death not even saying hi calm down sari i said softly lets just wait everything will be okay she let out a sigh but didnt say anything in reply we waited in silence i dont know how much time went by it seemed like hours and hours the slivers of cloud drifted away from the moon the wind continued to howl eerily around the side of the pyramid where are they what are they doing in there sari demanded i started to reply but stopped when i saw a flicker of light at the pyramid opening i grabbed saris arm look i whispered the light grew brighter a figure emerged pulling himself out quickly dr fielding as he stepped into the moonlight i caught the strange expression on his face his tiny black eyes were wide and seemed to be rolling around crazily in his head his eyebrows twitched his mouth was twisted open he seemed to be breathing hard dr fielding brushed himself off with his hands and began walking away from the pyramid he was halfwalking halfstaggering taking long quick strides with his lanky legs but wheres daddy sari whispered leaning out from the rocks i could see the pyramid opening clearly no light flickered no sign of uncle ben he he isnt coming out sari stammered and before i could react sari leaped out from our hiding place behind the stones and stepped into dr fieldings path dr fielding she cried loudly where is my dad i pushed myself away from the stones and hurried after sari i could see dr fieldings eyes spinning wildly he didnt answer her question where is my dad sari repeated shrilly dr fielding acted as if he didnt see sari he stepped past her walking stiffly awkwardly his arms straight down dr fielding sari called after him he hurried through the darkness toward the row of tents sari turned back to me her features tight with fear hes done something to daddy she cried i know he has i turned back to the pyramid opening still dark and silent the only sound now was the howling of the wind around the stone pyramid wall dr fielding totally ignored me sari cried her face revealing her anger he stormed past me as if i werent here i i know i stammered weakly and did you see the look on his face she demanded so evil so totally evil sari i started maybe gabe we have to go find daddy sari interrupted she grabbed my arm and started pulling me to the pyramid opening hurry no sari wait i insisted tugging out of her grasp we cant go stumbling around the pyramid in the dark well just get lost well never find uncle ben well go back to the tent and get lights she replied quick gabe i raised a hand to stop her wait here sari i instructed watch for your dad chances are hell be climbing out in a few moments ill run and get some flashlights staring at the dark opening she started to argue but then she changed her mind and agreed to my plan my heart pounding i ran all the way back to the tent i stopped at the tent opening and gazed down the row of tents searching for dr fielding no sign of him in the tent i grabbed up two flashlights then i went hurtling back to the pyramid please i begged silently as i ran please be out of the pyramid uncle ben please be safe but as i frantically made my way over the sand i could see sari standing by herself even from a distance i could see her frightened expression as she paced tensely back and forth in front of the pyramid opening uncle ben where are you i wondered why havent you come out of the pyramid are you okay sari and i didnt say a word there was no need we clicked on the flashlights then made our way into the pyramid opening it seemed much steeper than i remembered i nearly lost my balance lowering myself to the tunnel floor our lights crisscrossed over the dirt floor i raised mine to the low ceiling keeping the light high i led the way through the curving tunnel creeping along slowly i trailed one hand against the wall to steady myself the wall felt soft and crumbly sari kept on my heels her bright beam of light playing over the floor in front of our feet she stopped suddenly as the tunnel curved into a small empty chamber how do we know were going in the right direction she asked her voice a quivering whisper i shrugged breathing hard i thought you knew your way i murmured ive only been down here with daddy she replied her eyes over my shoulders searching the empty chamber well keep going until we find him i told her forcing myself to sound braver than i felt she stepped in front of me shining the light over the chamber walls daddy she shouted daddy can you hear me her voice echoed down the tunnel even the echo sounded frightened we froze in place and listened for a reply silence come on i urged i had to lower my head to step into the next narrow tunnel where did it lead were we heading toward prince khorrus tomb is that where we would find uncle ben questions questions i tried to stop them from coming but they filled my mind pestering me repeating echoing in my head as we followed the tunnels curves daddy daddy where are you saris cries became more frantic as we moved deeper and deeper into the pyramid the tunnel curved up steeply then leveled off sari suddenly stopped startled i bumped into her hard nearly making her drop her flashlight sorry i whispered gabe look she cried pointing her beam of light just ahead of her sneakers footprints i lowered my eyes to the small circle of light i could see a set of bootprints in the dirt a heel and spikey bumps work boots i muttered she circled the floor with the light there were several different prints in the dirt heading in the same direction we were does this mean were going the right way she asked maybe i replied studying the prints its hard to tell whether these are new or old daddy sari shouted eagerly can you hear me no reply she frowned and motioned for me to follow seeing the many sets of prints gave us new hope and we moved faster trailing our hands along the wall to steady ourselves as we made our way we both cried out happily when we realized we had reached the outer chamber to the tomb our lights played over the ancient hieroglyphs that covered the wall and the doorway daddy daddy saris voice cut through the heavy silence we darted through the empty chamber then slipped through the opening that led to the tomb the princes burial chamber stretched out in front of us dark and silent daddy daddy sari tried again i shouted too uncle ben are you here silence i swept my light over the rooms clutter of treasures over the heavy chests the chairs the clay jars piled in the corner he isnt here sari choked out with a disappointed sob then where did dr fielding bring uncle ben i asked thinking out loud theres nowhere else in the pyramid that they might come saris light came to rest on the large stone mummy case her eyes narrowed as she studied it uncle ben i shouted frantically are you in here somewhere sari grabbed my arm gabe look she cried her light remained on the mummy case i couldnt figure out what she was trying to show me what about it i demanded the lid sari murmured i gazed at the lid the heavy stone slab covered the case tightly the lid is closed sari continued stepping away from me and toward the mummy case her light remained on the lid yeah so i still didnt understand when we all left this afternoon sari explained the lid was open in fact i remember daddy telling the workers to leave the lid open for tonight youre right i cried help me gabe sari pleaded setting her flashlight down at her feet we have to open the mummy case i hesitated for a second feeling a wave of cold fear run down my body then i took a deep breath and moved to help sari she was already pushing the stone lid with both hands i stepped up beside her and pushed too pushed with all my might the stone slab slid more easily than id guessed working together sari and i strained against the lid pushing pushing we moved it about a foot then we both lowered our heads to peer into the mummys case and gasped in horror daddy sari shrieked uncle ben lay on his back knees raised hands at his sides his eyes shut sari and i shoved the heavy stone lid open another foot is he is he sari stammered i pressed my hand on his chest his heart was thumping with a steady beat hes breathing i told her i leaned into the mummy case uncle ben can you hear me uncle ben he didnt move i lifted his hand and squeezed it it felt warm but limp uncle ben wake up i shouted his eyes didnt open i lowered the hand back to the bottom of the mummy case hes out cold i murmured sari stood behind me both hands pressed against her cheeks she stared down at uncle ben her eyes wide with fear i i dont believe this she cried in a tiny voice dr fielding left daddy here to smother if we hadnt come along her voice trailed off uncle ben let out a low groan sari and i stared down at him hopefully but he didnt open his eyes we have to call the police i told sari we have to tell them about dr fielding but we cant just leave daddy here sari replied i started to reply but a frightening thought burst into my mind i felt a shudder of fear roll down my body sari i started if uncle ben is lying in the mummy case then where is the mummy her mouth dropped open she stared back at me in stunned silence and then we both heard the footsteps slow scraping footsteps and saw the mummy stagger stiffly into the room i opened my mouth to scream but no sound came out the mummy lurched stiffly through the chamber doorway he stared straight ahead with his vacant tarry eyes under the ancient layers of tar the skull grinned at us scrape scrape his feet dragged over the dirt floor trailing shreds of decaying gauze slowly he raised his arms making a terrifying cracking sound scrape scrape my throat tightened in terror my entire body began to tremble i backed away from the mummy case sari stood frozen with her hands pressed against her cheeks i grabbed her arm and pulled her back with me sari get back get back i whispered she stared in terror at the approaching mummy i couldnt tell if she heard me or not i tugged her back further our backs hit the chamber wall the mummy scraped closer closer staring at us through its vacant blackened eye sockets he reached for us with his yellowed tarencrusted hands sari let out a shrill shriek run i screamed sari run but our backs were pressed against the wall the mummy blocked our path to the doorway moving stiffly awkwardly the ancient corpse dragged itself closer this is all my fault i declared in a trembling voice i said the words five times i brought him back to life whwhat can we do sari cried in a hushed whisper i didnt have an answer uncle ben i shrieked desperately uncle ben help us but the mummy case remained silent even my frantic screams could not awaken my uncle sari and i edged along the chamber wall our eyes locked on the approaching mummy its bandaged feet scraped over the floor sending up dark clouds of dust as it moved heavily toward us a sour smell rose over the room the smell of a fourthousandyearold corpse coming to life i pressed my back against the cold stone of the chamber wall my mind racing the mummy stopped at the mummy case turned stiffly and continued lurching toward us hey i cried out as an idea burst into my mind my little mummy hand the summoner why hadnt i thought of it before it had saved us last summer by raising a group of ancient mummies from the dead could it also summon them to stop could it make them die again if i raised the little mummy hand up to prince khorru would it stop him long enough for sari and me to escape he was only seconds away from grabbing us it was worth a try i reached into my back jeans pocket for the mummy hand it was gone no i uttered a surprised cry and frantically grabbed at my other pockets no mummy hand gabe whats wrong sari demanded the mummy hand its gone i told her my voice choked with panic scrape scrape the foul odor grew stronger as the ancient mummy dragged nearer i was desperate to find my mummy hand but i knew there was no time to think about it now weve got to make a run for it i told sari the mummy is slow and stiff if we can get past him but what about daddy she cried we cant just leave him here we have to i told her well get help well come back for him the mummy made a brittle cracking sound as it stepped forward the sound of an ancient bone breaking but it continued toward us moving stiffly but steadily its arms outstretched sari run now i screamed i gave her a hard shove to get her going the room blurred as i forced myself to move the mummy made another loud cracking sound it leaned its body forward and reached out as we dodged around it i tried to duck under the mummys outstretched hand but i felt the scrape of its ancient fingers against the back of my neck cold fingers hard as a statue i knew it was a touch i would never forget my neck tingled i lowered my head from his grasp and plunged forward sari let out low sobs as she ran my heart raced as i hurried to catch up to her i forced myself to run but my legs felt so heavy as if they were made of solid stone we were nearly to the doorway when we saw a flickering light sari and i both cried out and skidded to a stop as a beam of light swept into the room behind the light a figure stepped into the doorway shielding my eyes from the sudden brightness i squinted hard eager to see who it was nila i cried as she raised the flashlight beam to the ceiling nila help us i choked out hes come alive sari shouted to her nila hes come alive she pointed back toward the mummy help us i screamed nilas green eyes widened in surprise what can i do she asked and then her expression changed quickly to anger what can i do about you two kids you shouldnt be here youre going to ruin everything huh i cried out in surprise nila stepped into the room she raised her right hand in the dim light i struggled to make out what she was holding up my little mummy hand she raised it toward the mummy come to me my brother nila called how did you get my mummy hand what are you doing i demanded nila ignored my questions she held the flashlight in one hand she gripped the little hand in the other holding it up toward the approaching mummy come here my brother she called waving the hand summoning the mummy it is i princess nila its legs cracking its brittle bones breaking inside the gauze wrappings the mummy obediently dragged itself forward nila stop it what are you doing sari shrieked but nila continued to ignore us it is i your sister she called to the mummy a triumphant smile crossed her pretty face her green eyes sparkled like flashing emeralds in the darting light i have waited so long for this day nila told the mummy i have waited so many centuries my brother hoping that someday someone would uncover your tomb and we could be reunited nilas face glowed with excitement the little mummy hand trembled in her hand i have brought you back to life my brother she called to the mummy i have waited for centuries but it will all be worth it you and i will share all this treasure and with our powers we shall rule egypt together as we did four thousand years ago she lowered her eyes to me thank you gabe she cried thank you for the summoner as soon as i saw it i knew i had to have it i knew it could bring my brother back to me the ancient words werent enough i needed the summoner too give it back i demanded reaching out for it its mine nila give it back a cruel laugh escaped her throat you wont be needing it gabe she said softly she waved the hand at the mummy destroy them my brother she ordered destroy them now there can be no witnesses nooo sari shrieked she and i both dove to the doorway but nila moved quickly to block our path i shoved my shoulder against her trying to push her away like a football lineman but nila held her ground with surprising strength nila let us go sari demanded breathing hard nila smiled and shook her head no witnesses she murmured nila we just want to get daddy out of here you can do what you want sari insisted desperately nila ignored her and raised her eyes to the mummy destroy them both she called they cannot leave this tomb alive sari and i spun around to see the mummy lumbering toward us its blackened skull glowed in the dim light it trailed long strips of yellowed gauze across the dirt floor as it dragged itself closer closer i turned back to the door nila blocked the way my eyes darted frantically around the chamber no way to escape no escape the mummy lurched toward sari and me and reached out its cold cold hands to obey nilas cruel command sari and i darted toward the door but nila blocked our escape its vacant eyes gazing blindly at us its jaw frozen in a hideous skeletal grin the mummy hurtled toward us raised its arms stiffly stretched out its hands dove at us with a final desperate lurch and to my shock reached past sari and me and wrapped its tarred hands around nilas throat her mouth opened in a choked cry of protest the mummy tilted back its head as it gripped her its tarred lips moved and a dry cough cut through the air and then the whispered words dry as death escaped the mummys throat let me rest in peace nila uttered a choked cry the mummy tightened its fierce grip on her throat i spun around and grabbed its arm let her go i screamed a dry wheeze erupted from the blackened skull its hands tightened around nila bending her back bending her toward the floor nilas eyes shut in defeat her hands flew up helplessly the flashlight and the mummy hand fell to the floor i grabbed my little mummy hand and shoved it into my jeans pocket let go let go let go i shrieked i leaped on to the mummys back and tried to pull its hands from nilas throat it let out a defiant roar a harsh whisper of anger then it heaved itself up straight and struggled to toss me off its shoulders i gasped startled by the mummys surprising strength as i started to slide off the mummys bandaged back i reached out my hand grabbing desperately grabbing air trying not to fall my hand grabbed onto nilas amber pendant hey i cried out as the mummy gave a hard toss i tumbled off the pendant tore off its chain it fell from my hand crashed to the floor and shattered noooooooooo nilas horrified wail shook the walls the mummy froze nila spun out of the mummys grasp backed away her eyes wide with terror my life my life she shrieked she bent and struggled to pick up shards of amber from the floor but the pendant had shattered into a hundred tiny pieces my life nila wailed staring at the smooth pieces in her palm she raised her eyes to sari and me i lived inside the pendant she cried at night i crept inside it kept me alive for over four thousand years and now now ohhhhh as her voice trailed off nila began to shrink her head her arms her entire body grew tinier tinier until she disappeared into her clothes and a few seconds later as sari and i gaped down in horror and shock a black scarab crawled out from under the sweatshirt and jeans the scarab moved unsteadily at first then it quickly scuttled away over the dirt floor disappearing into the darkness that that beetle sari stammered is it nila i nodded i guess i said staring down at nilas crumpled clothes do you think she was really an ancient egyptian princess prince khorrus sister sari murmured its all so weird i replied i was thinking hard trying to piece it all together trying to make sense of what nila had said she must have returned to her scarab form every night i told sari thinking out loud she crawled into the amber and slept inside it it kept her alive until until you smashed the amber pendant sari whispered yes i nodded it was an accident i started but i choked on my words as i felt a cold hand close on my shoulder and knew that the mummy had grabbed me from behind the hand rested on my shoulder the cold seeped through my tshirt let go i screamed i spun around and my heart skipped a beat uncle ben i cried daddy sari leaped forward and threw her arms around him daddy youre okay he pulled his hand off my shoulder and rubbed the back of his head he blinked his eyes uncertainly and shook his head still a little dazed behind him i saw the mummy standing hunched over frozen lifeless once again whew im still groggy uncle ben said sweeping a hand back through his thick black hair what a close call its all my fault i admitted i repeated the words five times uncle ben i didnt mean to bring the mummy back to life but a smile crossed my uncles face he lowered his arm around my shoulders you didnt do it gabe he said softly nila got there first he sighed i didnt believe in the power of the chant he said softly but i do now nila stole your mummy hand and chanted the ancient words she used the summoner to bring the mummy to life dr fielding and i were both suspicious of her you were i cried surprised but i thought i became suspicious of nila at dinner uncle ben explained remember she asked me what were the six ancient words to bring the dead to life well i had never revealed that there were six so i wondered how nila knew there were six words uncle ben put an arm around saris shoulders too and led us to the wall then he leaned his back against the wall rubbing the back of his head thats why i hurried to the communications tent right after dinner uncle ben continued i phoned the cairo sun they had never heard of nila at the newspaper so i knew she was a fake but we saw dr fielding pull you from the tent sari broke in we saw him force you into the pyramid and uncle ben chuckled you two arent very good spies he scolded dr fielding didnt force me to do anything he had spotted nila sneaking into the pyramid so he found me at the communications tent and the two of us hurried to the pyramid to see what nila was up to we got there too late uncle ben continued she had already brought the mummy to life dr fielding and i tried to stop her she hit me over the head with her flashlight she dragged me to the mummy case i guess she stuffed me inside he rubbed his head thats all i remember until now until i awoke and saw nila turn into a scarab we saw dr fielding hurry out of the pyramid sari reported he walked right past me he had the weirdest look on his face and she stopped and her mouth dropped open we all heard the sounds at the same time the scraping of feet on the floor outside the burial chamber my heart jumped to my throat i grabbed uncle bens arm the footsteps dragged closer more mummies more mummies brought to life staggering toward the princes tomb i reached into my jeans pocket for my little mummy hand pressing my back against the wall i raised my eyes to the chamber doorway and waited waited for the mummies to appear but to my surprise dr fielding burst into the room followed by four darkuniformed police officers hands at their gun holsters ben are you okay dr fielding called to my uncle where is the young woman she escaped uncle ben told him how could he explain that she had turned into a bug the police explored the chamber warily their eyes came to rest on the mummy frozen in place near the doorway im so glad youre okay ben dr fielding said placing a hand warmly on uncle bens shoulder then he turned to sari im afraid i owe you an apology sari he said frowning when i ran out of here i must have been in shock i remember seeing you outside the pyramid but i dont remember saying anything to you thats okay sari replied quietly im really sorry if i frightened you dr fielding told her your dad had been knocked unconscious by that crazy young woman and all i could think about was calling the police as fast as possible well the excitement is over uncle ben said smiling lets all get out of here we started toward the doorway but a police officer interrupted could i just ask one question he asked staring at the upright mummy in the center of the floor did that mummy walk of course not uncle ben replied quickly a grin spreading over his face if it could walk what would it be doing in this dump well once again i turned out to be the hero of the day and of course later in the tent i wasted no time in bragging about my courage to sari sari had no choice she had to sit there and take it after all i was the one who had stopped the mummy and turned nila back into a beetle by smashing her pendant at least youre not too conceited sari shot back rolling her eyes lame really lame well that scarab crawled away and disappeared she said an evil smile crossed saris lips ill bet that bug is waiting for you gabe ill bet its waiting for you in your cot waiting to bite you i laughed sari youd say anything to try to scare me you just cant stand the idea that im the hero youre right she replied dryly i cant stand the idea good night gabe a few minutes later i was in my pajamas and ready for bed what a night what an amazing night as i slid into the cot and pulled up the covers i knew it was a night i would never forget ouch
