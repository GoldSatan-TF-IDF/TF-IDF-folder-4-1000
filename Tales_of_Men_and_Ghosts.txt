the author of diadems and faggots first edition of one hundred and fifty thousand already sold out order now a hundred and fifty thousand volumes and an average of three readers to each half a million of people would be reading him within a week and every one of them would write to him and their friends and relations would write too he laid down the paper with a shudder the two notes looked harmless enough and the calligraphy of one was vaguely familiar he opened the envelope and looked at the signature duncan vyse he had not seen the name in years what on earth could duncan vyse have to say he ran over the page and dropped it with a wondering exclamation which the watchful strett reentering met by a tentative yes sir nothing yes that is betton picked up the note theres a gentleman a mr vyse coming to see me at ten strett glanced at the clock yes sir youll remember that ten was the hour you appointed for the secretaries to call sir betton nodded ill see mr vyse first my clothes please as he got into them in the state of irritable hurry that had become almost chronic with him he continued to think about duncan vyse they had seen a lot of each other for the few years after both had left harvard the hard happy years when betton had been grinding at his business and vyse poor devil trying to write the novelist recalled his friends attempts with a smile then the memory of one small volume came back to him it was a novel the lifted lamp there was stuff in that certainly he remembered vyses tossing it down on his table with a gesture of despair when it came back from the last publisher betton taking it up indifferently had sat riveted till daylight when he ended the impression was so strong that he said to himself ill tell apthorn about it ill go and see him tomorrow his own secret literary yearnings gave him a passionate desire to champion vyse to see him triumph over the ignorance and timidity of the publishers apthorn was the youngest of the guild still capable of opinions and the courage of them a personal friend of bettons and as it happened the man afterward to become known as the privileged publisher of diadems and faggots unluckily the next day something unexpected turned up and betton forgot about vyse and his manuscript he continued to forget for a month and then came a note from vyse who was ill and wrote to ask what his friend had done betton did not like to say ive done nothing so he left the note unanswered and vowed again ill see apthorn the following day he was called to the west on business and was gone a month when he came back there was another note from vyse who was still ill and desperately hard up ill take anything for the book if theyll advance me two hundred dollars betton full of compunction would gladly have advanced the sum himself but he was hard up too and could only swear inwardly ill write to apthorn then he glanced again at the manuscript and reflected no there are things in it that need explaining id better see him once he went so far as to telephone apthorn but the publisher was out then he finally and completely forgot one sunday he went out of town and on his return rummaging among the papers on his desk he missed the lifted lamp which had been gathering dust there for half a year what the deuce could have become of it betton spent a feverish hour in vainly increasing the disorder of his documents and then bethought himself of calling the maidservant who first indignantly denied having touched anything i can see thats true from the dust betton scathingly interjected and then mentioned with hauteur that a young lady had called in his absence and asked to be allowed to get a book a lady did you let her come up she said somebodyd sent her vyse of course vyse had sent her for his manuscript he was always mixed up with some woman and it was just like him to send the girl of the moment to bettons lodgings with instructions to force the door in his absence vyse had never been remarkable for delicacy betton furious glanced over his table to see if any of his own effects were missing one couldnt tell with the company vyse kept and then dismissed the matter from his mind with a vague sense of magnanimity in doing so he felt himself exonerated by vyses conduct the sense of magnanimity was still uppermost when the valet opened the door to announce mr vyse and betton a moment later crossed the threshold of his pleasant library his first thought was that the man facing him from the hearthrug was the very duncan vyse of old small starved bleachedlooking with the same sidelong movements the same queer air of anaemic truculence only he had grown shabbier and bald betton held out a hospitable hand this is a good surprise glad you looked me up my dear fellow vyses palm was damp and bony he had always had a disagreeable hand you got my note you know what ive come for he said about the secretaryship sit down is that really serious betton lowered himself luxuriously into one of his vast maple armchairs he had grown stouter in the last year and the cushion behind him fitted comfortably into the crease of his nape as he leaned back he caught sight of his image in the mirror between the windows and reflected uneasily that vyse would not find him unchanged serious vyse rejoined why not arent you oh perfectly betton laughed apologetically only well the fact is you may not understand what rubbish a secretary of mine would have to deal with in advertising for one i never imagined i didnt aspire to any one above the ordinary hack im the ordinary hack said vyse drily bettons affable gesture protested my dear fellow you see its not business what im in now he continued with a laugh vyses thin lips seemed to form a noiseless isnt it which they instantly transposed into the audibly reply i inferred from your advertisement that you want some one to relieve you in your literary work dictation shorthand that kind of thing well no not that either i type my own things what im looking for is somebody who wont be above tackling my correspondence vyse looked slightly surprised i should be glad of the job he then said betton began to feel a vague embarrassment he had supposed that such a proposal would be instantly rejected it would be only for an hour or two a day if youre doing any writing of your own he threw out interrogatively no ive given all that up im in an office now business but it doesnt take all my time or pay enough to keep me alive in that case my dear fellow if you could come every morning but its mostly awful bosh you know betton again broke off with growing awkwardness vyse glanced at him humorously what you want me to write well that depends betton sketched the obligatory smile but i was thinking of the letters youll have to answer letters about my books you know ive another one appearing next week and i want to be beforehand now dam the flood before it swamps me have you any idea of the deluge of stuff that people write to a successful novelist as betton spoke he saw a tinge of red on vyses thin cheek and his own reflected it in a richer glow of shame i mean i mean he stammered helplessly no i havent said vyse but it will be awfully jolly finding out there was a pause groping and desperate on bettons part sardonically calm on his visitors you youve given up writing altogether betton continued yes weve changed places as it were vyse paused but about these letters you dictate the answers lord no thats the reason why i said i wanted somebody er well used to writing i dont want to have anything to do with them not a thing youll have to answer them as if they were written to you betton pulled himself up again and rising in confusion jerked open one of the drawers of his writingtable here this kind of rubbish he said tossing a packet of letters onto vyses knee oh you keep them do you said vyse simply i well some of them a few of the funniest only vyse slipped off the band and began to open the letters while he was glancing over them betton again caught his own reflection in the glass and asked himself what impression he had made on his visitor it occurred to him for the first time that his highcoloured wellfed person presented the image of commercial rather than of intellectual achievement he did not look like his own idea of the author of diadems and faggots and he wondered why vyse laid the letters aside i think i can do it if youll give me a notion of the tone im to take the tone yes that is if im to sign your name oh of course i expect you to sign for me as for the tone say just what youd well say all you can without encouraging them to answer vyse rose from his seat i could submit a few specimens he suggested oh as to that you always wrote better than i do said betton handsomely ive never had this kind of thing to write when do you wish me to begin vyse enquired ignoring the tribute the books out on monday the deluge will begin about three days after will you turn up on thursday at this hour betton held his hand out with real heartiness it was great luck for me your striking that advertisement dont be too harsh with my correspondents i owe them something for having brought us together ii the deluge began punctually on the thursday and vyse arriving as punctually had an impressive pile of letters to attack betton on his way to the park for a ride came into the library smoking the cigarette of indolence to look over his secretarys shoulder how many of em twenty good lord its going to be worse than diadems ive just had my first quiet breakfast in two years time to read the papers and loaf how i used to dread the sight of my letterbox now i shant know i have one he leaned over vyses chair and the secretary handed him a letter heres rather an exceptional one lady evidently i thought you might want to answer it yourself exceptional betton ran over the mauve pages and tossed them down why my dear man i get hundreds like that youll have to be pretty short with her or shell send her photograph he clapped vyse on the shoulder and turned away humming a tune stay to luncheon he called back gaily from the threshold after luncheon vyse insisted on showing a few of his answers to the first batch of letters if ive struck the note i wont bother you again he urged and betton groaningly consented my dear fellow theyre beautiful too beautiful ill be let in for a correspondence with every one of these people vyse at this meditated for a while above a blank sheet all right hows this he said after another interval of rapid writing betton glanced over the page by george by george wont she see it he exulted between fear and rapture its wonderful how little people see said vyse reassuringly the letters continued to pour in for several weeks after the appearance of abundance for five or six blissful days betton did not even have his mail brought to him trusting to vyse to single out his personal correspondence and to deal with the rest according to their agreement during those days he luxuriated in a sense of wild and lawless freedom then gradually he began to feel the need of fresh restraints to break and learned that the zest of liberty lies in the escape from specific obligations at first he was conscious only of a vague hunger but in time the craving resolved into a shamefaced desire to see his letters after all i hated them only because i had to answer them and he told vyse carelessly that he wished all his letters submitted to him before the secretary answered them at first he pushed aside those beginning i have just laid down abundance after a third reading or every day for the last month i have been telephoning my bookseller to know when your novel would be out but little by little the freshness of his interest revived and even this stereotyped homage began to arrest his eye at last a day came when he read all the letters from the first word to the last as he had done when diadems and faggots appeared it was really a pleasure to read them now that he was relieved of the burden of replying his new relation to his correspondents had the glow of a loveaffair unchilled by the contingency of marriage one day it struck him that the letters were coming in more slowly and in smaller numbers certainly there had been more of a rush when diadems and faggots came out betton began to wonder if vyse were exercising an unauthorized discrimination and keeping back the communications he deemed least important this sudden conjecture carried the novelist straight to his library where he found vyse bending over the writingtable with his usual inscrutable pale smile but once there betton hardly knew how to frame his question and blundered into an enquiry for a missing invitation theres a note a personal note i ought to have had this morning sure you havent kept it back by mistake among the others vyse laid down his pen the others but i never keep back any betton had foreseen the answer not even the worst twaddle about my book he suggested lightly pushing the papers about nothing i understood you wanted to go over them all first well perhaps its safer betton conceded as if the idea were new to him with an embarrassed hand he continued to turn over the letters at vyses elbow those are yesterdays said the secretary here are todays he added pointing to a meagre trio hm only these betton took them and looked them over lingeringly i dont see what the deuce that chap means about the first part of abundance certainly justifying the title do you vyse was silent and the novelist continued irritably damned cheek his writing if he doesnt like the book who cares what he thinks about it anyhow and his morning ride was embittered by the discovery that it was unexpectedly disagreeable to have vyse read any letters which did not express unqualified praise of his books he began to fancy there was a latent rancour a kind of baffled sneer under vyses manner and he decided to return to the practice of having his mail brought straight to his room in that way he could edit the letters before his secretary saw them vyse made no comment on the change and betton was reduced to wondering whether his imperturbable composure were the mask of complete indifference or of a watchful jealousy the latter view being more agreeable to his employers selfesteem the next step was to conclude that vyse had not forgotten the episode of the lifted lamp and would naturally take a vindictive joy in any unfavourable judgments passed on his rivals work this did not simplify the situation for there was no denying that unfavourable criticisms preponderated in bettons correspondence abundance was neither meeting with the unrestricted welcome of diadems and faggots nor enjoying the alternative of an animated controversy it was simply found dull and its readers said so in language not too tactfully tempered by regretful comparisons with its predecessor to withhold unfavourable comments from vyse was therefore to make it appear that correspondence about the book had died out and its author mindful of his unguarded predictions found this even more embarrassing the simplest solution would be to get rid of vyse and to this end betton began to address his energies one evening finding himself unexpectedly disengaged he asked vyse to dine it had occurred to him that in the course of an afterdinner chat he might delicately hint his feeling that the work he had offered his friend was unworthy so accomplished a hand vyse surprised him by a momentary hesitation i may not have time to dress betton stared whats the odds well dine here and as late as you like vyse thanked him and appeared punctually at eight in all the shabbiness of his daily wear he looked paler and more shyly truculent than usual and betton from the height of his florid stature said to himself with the sudden professional instinct for type he might be an agent of something a chap who carries deadly secrets vyse it was to appear did carry a deadly secret but one less perilous to society than to himself he was simply poor inexcusably irremediably poor everything failed him had always failed him whatever he put his hand to went to bits this was the confession that reluctantly yet with a kind of whitelipped bravado he flung at betton in answer to the latters tentative suggestion that really the letteranswering job wasnt worth bothering him with a thing that any typewriter could do if you mean youre paying me more than its worth ill take less vyse rushed out after a pause oh my dear fellow betton protested flushing what do you mean then dont i answer the letters as you want them answered betton anxiously stroked his silken ankle you do it beautifully too beautifully i mean what i say the works not worthy of you im ashamed to ask you oh hang shame vyse interrupted do you know why i said i shouldnt have time to dress tonight because i havent any evening clothes as a matter of fact i havent much but the clothes i stand in one thing after anothers gone against me all the infernal ingenuities of chance its been a slow chinese torture the kind where they keep you alive to have more fun killing you he straightened himself with a sudden blush oh im all right now getting on capitally but im still walking rather a narrow plank and if i do your work well enough if i take your idea betton stared into the fire without answering he knew next to nothing of vyses history of the mischance or mismanagement that had brought him with his brains and his training to so unlikely a pass but a pang of compunction shot through him as he remembered the manuscript of the lifted lamp gathering dust on his table for half a year not that it would have made any earthly difference since hes evidently never been able to get the thing published but this reflection did not wholly console betton and he found it impossible at the moment to tell vyse that his services were not needed iii during the ensuing weeks the letters grew fewer and fewer and betton foresaw the approach of the fatal day when his secretary in common decency would have to say i cant draw my pay for doing nothing what a triumph for vyse the thought was intolerable and betton cursed his weakness in not having dismissed the fellow before such a possibility arose if i tell him ive no use for him now hell see straight through it of course and then hang it he looks so poor this consideration came after the other but betton in rearranging them put it first because he thought it looked better there and also because he immediately perceived its value in justifying a plan of action that was beginning to take shape in his mind poor devil im damned if i dont do it for him said betton sitting down at his desk three or four days later he sent word to vyse that he didnt care to go over the letters any longer and that they would once more be carried directly to the library the next time he lounged in on his way to his morning ride he found his secretarys pen in active motion a lot today vyse told him cheerfully his tone irritated betton it had the inane optimism of the physician reassuring a discouraged patient oh lord i thought it was almost over groaned the novelist no theyve just got their second wind heres one from a chicago publisher never heard the name offering you thirty per cent on your next novel with an advance royalty of twenty thousand and heres a chap who wants to syndicate it for a bunch of sunday papers big offer too thats from ann arbor and this oh this ones funny he held up a small scented sheet to betton who made no movement to receive it funny whys it funny he growled well its from a girl a lady and she thinks shes the only person who understands abundance has the clue to it says shes never seen a book so misrepresented by the critics ha ha that is good betton agreed with too loud a laugh this ones from a lady too married woman says shes misunderstood and would like to correspond oh lord said betton what are you looking at he added sharply as vyse continued to bend his blinking gaze on the letters i was only thinking id never seen such short letters from women neither one fills the first page well what of that queried betton vyse reflected id like to meet a woman like that he said wearily and betton laughed again the letters continued to pour in and there could be no farther question of dispensing with vyses services but one morning about three weeks later the latter asked for a word with his employer and betton on entering the library found his secretary with half a dozen documents spread out before him whats up queried betton with a touch of impatience vyse was attentively scanning the outspread letters i dont know cant make out his voice had a faint note of embarrassment do you remember a note signed hester macklin that came three or four weeks ago married misunderstood western army post wanted to correspond betton seemed to grope among his memories then he assented vaguely a short note vyse went on the whole story in half a page the shortness struck me so much and the directness that i wrote her wrote in my own name i mean in your own name betton stood amazed then he broke into a groan good lord vyse youre incorrigible the secretary pulled his thin moustache with a nervous laugh if you mean im an ass youre right look here he held out an envelope stamped with the words dead letter office my effusion has come back to me marked unknown theres no such person at the address she gave you betton seemed for an instant to share his secretarys embarrassment then he burst into an uproarious laugh hoax was it thats rough on you old fellow vyse shrugged his shoulders yes but the interesting question is why on earth didnt your answer come back too my answer the official one the one i wrote in your name if shes unknown whats become of that betton stared at him with eyes wrinkled by amusement perhaps she hadnt disappeared then vyse disregarded the conjecture look here i believe all these letters are a hoax he broke out betton stared at him with a face that turned slowly red and angry what are you talking about all what letters these ive spread out here ive been comparing them and i believe theyre all written by one man burtons redness turned to a purple that made his ruddy moustache seem pale what the devil are you driving at he asked well just look at it vyse persisted still bent above the letters ive been studying them carefully those that have come within the last two or three weeks and theres a queer likeness in the writing of some of them the gs are all like corkscrews and the same phrases keep recurring the ann arbor newsagent uses the same expressions as the president of the girls college at euphorbia maine betton laughed arent the critics always groaning over the shrinkage of the national vocabulary of course we all use the same expressions yes said vyse obstinately but how about using the same gs betton laughed again but vyse continued without heeding him look here betton could strett have written them strett betton roared strett he threw himself into his armchair to shake out his mirth at greater ease ill tell you why strett always posts all my answers he comes in for them every day before i leave he posted the letter to the misunderstood party the letter from you that the dead letter office didnt return i posted my own letter to her and that came back a measurable silence followed the emission of this ingenious conjecture then betton observed with gentle irony extremely neat and of course its no business of yours to supply any valid motive for this remarkable attention on my valets part vyse cast on him a slanting glance if youve found that human conducts generally based on valid motives well outside of madhouses its supposed to be not quite incalculable vyse had an odd smile under his thin moustache every house is a madhouse at some time or another betton rose with a careless shake of the shoulders this one will be if i talk to you much longer he said moving away with a laugh iv betton did not for a moment believe that vyse suspected the valet of having written the letters why the devil dont he say out what he thinks he was always a tortuous chap he grumbled inwardly the sense of being held under the lens of vyses mute scrutiny became more and more exasperating betton by this time had squared his shoulders to the fact that abundance was a failure with the public a confessed and glaring failure the press told him so openly and his friends emphasized the fact by their circumlocutions and evasions betton minded it a good deal more than he had expected but not nearly as much as he minded vyses knowing it that remained the central twinge in his diffused discomfort and the problem of getting rid of his secretary once more engaged him he had set aside all sentimental pretexts for retaining vyse but a practical argument replaced them if i ship him now hell think its because im ashamed to have him see that im not getting any more letters for the letters had ceased again almost abruptly since vyse had hazarded the conjecture that they were the product of stretts devoted pen betton had reverted only once to the subject to ask ironically a day or two later is strett writing to me as much as ever and on vyses replying with a neutral headshake had added with a laugh if you suspect him you might as well think i write the letters myself there are very few today said vyse with his irritating evasiveness and betton rejoined squarely oh theyll stop soon the books a failure a few mornings later he felt a rush of shame at his own tergiversations and stalked into the library with vyses sentence on his tongue vyse started back with one of his anaemic blushes i was hoping youd be in i wanted to speak to you thereve been no letters the last day or two he explained betton drew a quick breath of relief the man had some sense of decency then he meant to dismiss himself i told you so my dear fellow the books a flat failure he said almost gaily vyse made a deprecating gesture i dont know that i should regard the absence of letters as the ultimate test but i wanted to ask you if there isnt something else i can do on the days when theres no writing he turned his glance toward the booklined walls dont you want your library catalogued he asked insidiously had it done last year thanks betton glanced away from vyses face it was piteous how he needed the job i see of course this is just a temporary lull in the letters theyll begin again as they did before the people who read carefully read slowly you havent heard yet what they think betton felt a rush of puerile joy at the suggestion actually he hadnt thought of that there was a big second crop after diadems and faggots he mused aloud of course wait and see said vyse confidently the letters in fact began again more gradually and in smaller numbers but their quality was different as vyse had predicted and in two cases bettons correspondents not content to compress into one rapid communication the thoughts inspired by his work developed their views in a succession of really remarkable letters one of the writers was a professor in a western college the other was a girl in florida in their language their point of view their reasons for appreciating abundance they differed almost diametrically but this only made the unanimity of their approval the more striking the rush of correspondence evoked by bettons earlier novel had produced nothing so personal so exceptional as these communications he had gulped the praise of diadems and faggots as undiscriminatingly as it was offered now he knew for the first time the subtler pleasures of the palate he tried to feign indifference even to himself and to vyse he made no sign but gradually he felt a desire to know what his secretary thought of the letters and above all what he was saying in reply to them and he resented acutely the possibility of vyses starting one of his clandestine correspondences with the girl in florida vyses notorious lack of delicacy had never been more vividly present to bettons imagination and he made up his mind to answer the letters himself he would keep vyse on of course there were other communications that the secretary could attend to and if necessary betton would invent an occupation he cursed his stupidity in having betrayed the fact that his books were already catalogued vyse showed no surprise when betton announced his intention of dealing personally with the two correspondents who showed so flattering a reluctance to take their leave but betton immediately read a criticism in his lack of comment and put forth on a note of challenge after all one must be decent vyse looked at him with an evanescent smile youll have to explain that you didnt write the first answers betton halted well i i more or less dictated them didnt i oh virtually theyre yours of course you think i can put it that way why not the secretary absently drew an arabesque on the blottingpad of course theyll keep it up longer if you write yourself he suggested betton blushed but faced the issue hang it all i shant be sorry they interest me theyre remarkable letters and vyse without observation returned to his writings the spring that year was delicious to betton his college professor continued to address him tersely but cogently at fixed intervals and twice a week eight serried pages came from florida there were other letters too he had the solace of feeling that at last abundance was making its way was reaching the people who as vyse said read slowly because they read intelligently but welcome as were all these proofs of his restored authority they were but the background of his happiness his life revolved for the moment about the personality of his two chief correspondents the professors letters satisfied his craving for intellectual recognition and the satisfaction he felt in them proved how completely he had lost faith in himself he blushed to think that his opinion of his work had been swayed by the shallow judgments of a public whose taste he despised was it possible that he had allowed himself to think less well of abundance because it was not to the taste of the average novelreader such false humility was less excusable than the crudest appetite for praise it was ridiculous to try to do conscientious work if ones selfesteem were at the mercy of popular judgments all this the professors letters delicately and indirectly conveyed to betton with the result that the author of abundance began to recognize in it the ripest flower of his genius but if the professor understood his book the girl in florida understood him and betton was fully alive to the superior qualities of discernment which this process implied for his lovely correspondent his novel was but the startingpoint the pretext of her discourse he himself was her real object and he had the delicious sense as their exchange of thoughts proceeded that she was interested in abundance because of its author rather than in the author because of his book of course she laid stress on the fact that his ideas were the object of her contemplation but bettons agreeable person had permitted him some insight into the incorrigible subjectiveness of female judgments and he was pleasantly aware from the ladys tone that she guessed him to be neither old nor ridiculous and suddenly he wrote to ask if he might see her the answer was long in coming betton fumed at the delay watched wondered fretted then he received the one word impossible he wrote back more urgently and awaited the reply with increasing eagerness a certain shyness had kept him from once more modifying the instructions regarding his mail and strett still carried the letters directly to vyse the hour when he knew they were passing under the latters eyes was now becoming intolerable to betton and it was a profound relief when the secretary suddenly advised of his fathers illness asked permission to absent himself for a fortnight vyse departed just after betton had despatched to florida his second missive of entreaty and for ten days he tasted the furtive joy of a first perusal of his letters the answer from florida was not among them but betton said to himself shes thinking it over and delay in that light seemed favourable so charming in fact was this phase of sentimental suspense that he felt a start of resentment when a telegram apprised him one morning that vyse would return to his post that day betton had slept later than usual and springing out of bed with the telegram in his hand he learned from the clock that his secretary was due in half an hour he reflected that the mornings mail must long since be in and too impatient to wait for its appearance with his breakfasttray he threw on a dressinggown and went to the library there lay the letters half a dozen of them but his eye flew to one envelope and as he tore it open a warm wave rocked his heart the letter was dated a few days after its writer must have received his own it had all the qualities of grace and insight to which his unknown friend had accustomed him but it contained no allusion however indirect to the special purport of his appeal even a vanity less ingenious than bettons might have read in the ladys silence one of the most familiar motions of consent but the smile provoked by this inference faded as he turned to his other letters for the uppermost bore the superscription dead letter office and the document that fell from it was his own last letter from florida betton studied the ironic unknown for an appreciable space of time then he broke into a laugh he had suddenly recalled vyses similar experience with hester macklin and the light he was able to throw on that obscure episode was searching enough to penetrate all the dark corners of his own adventure he felt a rush of heat to the ears catching sight of himself in the glass he saw a red ridiculous congested countenance and dropped into a chair to hide it between flushed fists he was roused by the opening of the door and vyse appeared on the threshold oh i beg pardon youre ill said the secretary bettons only answer was an inarticulate murmur of derision then he pushed forward the letter with the imprint of the dead letter office look at that he jeered vyse peered at the envelope and turned it over slowly in his hands bettons eyes fixed on him saw his face decompose like a substance touched by some powerful acid he clung to the envelope as if to gain time its from the young lady youve been writing to at swazee springs he asked at length its from the young lady ive been writing to at swazee springs well i suppose shes gone away continued vyse rebuilding his countenance rapidly yes and in a community numbering perhaps a hundred and seventyfive souls including the dogs and chickens the local postoffice is so ignorant of her movements that my letter has to be sent to the dead letter office vyse meditated on this then he laughed in turn after all the same thing happened to me with hester macklin i mean he recalled sheepishly just so said betton bringing down his clenched fist on the table just so he repeated in italics he caught his secretarys glance and held it with his own for a moment then he dropped it as in pity one releases something scared and squirming the very day my letter was returned from swazee springs she wrote me this from there he said holding up the last florida missive ha thats funny said vyse with a damp forehead yes its funny its funny said betton he leaned back his hands in his pockets staring up at the ceiling and noticing a crack in the cornice vyse at the corner of the writingtable waited shall i get to work he began after a silence measurable by minutes bettons gaze descended from the cornice ive got your seat havent i he said rising and moving away from the table vyse with a quick gleam of relief slipped into the vacant chair and began to stir about vaguely among the papers hows your father betton asked from the hearth oh better better thank you hell pull out of it but you had a sharp scare for a day or two yes it was touch and go when i got there another pause while vyse began to classify the letters and i suppose betton continued in a steady tone your anxiety made you forget your usual precautions whatever they were about this florida correspondence and before youd had time to prevent it the swazee postoffice blundered vyse lifted his head with a quick movement what do you mean he asked pushing his chair back i mean that you saw i couldnt live without flattery and that youve been ladling it out to me to earn your keep vyse sat motionless and shrunken digging the blottingpad with his pen what on earth are you driving at he repeated though why the deuce betton continued in the same steady tone you should need to do this kind of work when youve got such faculties at your service those letters were magnificent my dear fellow why in the world dont you write novels instead of writing to other people about them vyse straightened himself with an effort what are you talking about betton why the devil do you think i wrote those letters betton held back his answer with a brooding face because i wrote hester macklins to myself vyse sat stockstill without the least outcry of wonder well he finally said in a low tone and because you found me out you see you cant even feign surprise because you saw through it at a glance knew at once that the letters were faked and when youd foolishly put me on my guard by pointing out to me that they were a clumsy forgery and had then suddenly guessed that i was the forger you drew the natural inference that i had to have popular approval or at least had to make you think i had it you saw that to me the worst thing about the failure of the book was having you know it was a failure and so you applied your superior your immeasurably superior abilities to carrying on the humbug and deceiving me as id tried to deceive you and you did it so successfully that i dont see why the devil you havent made your fortune writing novels vyse remained silent his head slightly bent under the mounting tide of bettons denunciation the way you differentiated your people characterised them avoided my stupid mistake of making the womens letters too short and logical of letting my different correspondents use the same expressions the amount of ingenuity and art you wasted on it i swear vyse im sorry that damned postoffice went back on you betton went on piling up the waves of his irony but at this height they suddenly paused drew back on themselves and began to recede before the spectacle of vyses pale distress something warm and emotional in bettons nature a lurking kindliness perhaps for any one who tried to soothe and smooth his writhing ego softened his eye as it rested on the drooping figure of his secretary look here vyse im not sorry not altogether sorry this has happened he moved slowly across the room and laid a friendly palm on vyses shoulder in a queer illogical way it evens up things as it were i did you a shabby turn once years ago oh out of sheer carelessness of course about that novel of yours i promised to give to apthorn if i had given it it might not have made any difference im not sure it wasnt too good for success but anyhow i dare say you thought my personal influence might have helped you might at least have got you a quicker hearing perhaps you thought it was because the thing was so good that i kept it back that i felt some nasty jealousy of your superiority i swear to you it wasnt that i clean forgot it and one day when i came home it was gone youd sent and taken it and ive always thought since you might have owed me a grudge and not unjustly so this this business of the letters the sympathy youve shown for i suppose it is sympathy vyse startled and checked him by a queer crackling laugh its not sympathy broke in betton the moisture drying out of his voice he withdrew his hand from vyses shoulder what is it then the joy of uncovering my nakedness an eye for an eye is it that vyse rose from his seat and with a mechanical gesture swept into a heap all the letters he had sorted im stone broke and wanted to keep my job thats what it is he said wearily the legend i arthur bernald could never afterward recall just when the first conjecture flashed on him oddly enough there was no record of it in the agitated jottings of his diary but as it seemed to him in retrospect he had always felt that the queer man at the wades must be john pellerin if only for the negative reason that he couldnt imaginably be any one else it was impossible in the confused pattern of the centurys intellectual life to fit the stranger in anywhere save in the big gap which some five and twenty years earlier had been left by pellerins unaccountable disappearance and conversely such a man as the wades visitor couldnt have lived for sixty years without filling somewhere in space a nearly equivalent void at all events it was certainly not to doctor wade or to his mother that bernald owed the hint the good unconscious wades one of whose chief charms in the young mans eyes was that they remained so robustly untainted by pellerinism in spite of the fact that doctor wades younger brother howland was among its most impudently flourishing highpriests the incident had begun by bernalds running across doctor robert wade one hot summer night at the university club and by wades saying in the tone of unprofessional laxity which the shadowy stillness of the place invited i got hold of a queer fish at st martins the other day case of heatprostration picked up in central park when wed patched him up i found he had nowhere to go and not a dollar in his pocket and i sent him down to our place at portchester to rebuild the opening roused his hearers attention bob wade had an odd unformulated sense of values that bernald had learned to trust what sort of chap young or old oh every age full of years and yet with a lot left he called himself sixty on the books sixtys a good age for some kinds of living and age is of course purely subjective how has he used his sixty years well part of them in educating himself apparently hes a scholar humanities languages and so forth oh decayed gentleman bernald murmured disappointed decayed not much cried the doctor with his accustomed literalness i only mentioned that side of winterman his names winterman because it was the side my mother noticed first i suppose women generally do but its only a part a small part the mans the big thing really big well there again when i took him down to the country looking rather like a tramp from a shelter with an untrimmed beard and a suit of reachmedowns hed slept round the park in for a week i felt sure my motherd carry the silver up to her room and send for the gardeners dog to sleep in the hall the first night but she didnt i see women and children love him oh wade bernald groaned not a bit of it youre out again we dont love him either of us but we feel him the airs charged with him youll see and bernald agreed that he would see the following sunday wades inarticulate attempts to characterize the stranger had struck his friend the human revelation had for bernald a poignant and everrenewed interest which his trade as the dramatic critic of a daily paper had hitherto failed to discourage and he knew that bob wade simple and undefiled by literature bernalds specific affliction had a free and personal way of judging men and the diviners knack of reaching their hidden springs during the days that followed the young doctor gave bernald farther details about john winterman details not of fact for in that respect his visitors reticence was baffling but of impression it appeared that winterman while lying insensible in the park had been robbed of the few dollars he possessed and on leaving the hospital still weak and halfblind he had quite simply and unprotestingly accepted the wades offer to give him shelter till such time as he should be strong enough to go to work but whats his work bernald interjected hasnt he at least told you that well writing some kind of writing doctor bob always became vague and clumsy when he approached the confines of literature he means to take it up again as soon as his eyes get right bernald groaned oh lord that finishes him and me hes looking for a publisher of course he wants a favourable notice i wont come he hasnt written a line for twenty years a line of what what kind of literature can one keep corked up for twenty years wade surprised him the real kind i should say but i dont know wintermans line the doctor added he speaks of the things he used to write merely as stuff that wouldnt sell he has a wonderfully confidential way of not telling one things but he says hell have to do something for his living as soon as his eyes are patched up and that writing is the only trade he knows the queer thing is that he seems pretty sure of selling now he even talked of buying the bungalow of us with an acre or two about it the bungalow whats that the studio down by the shore that we built for howland when he thought he meant to paint howland wade as bernald knew had experienced various calls since hes taken to writing nobodys been near it i offered it to winterman and he camps there cooks his meals does his own housekeeping and never comes up to the house except in the evenings when he joins us on the verandah in the dark and smokes while my mother knits a discreet visitor eh more than he need be my mother actually wanted him to stay on in the house in her pink chintz room think of it but he says houses smother him i take it hes lived for years in the open in the open where i cant make out except that it was somewhere in the east east of everything beyond the dayspring in places not on the map thats the way he put it and when i said youve been an explorer then he smiled in his beard and answered yes thats it an explorer yet he doesnt strike me as a man of action hasnt the hands or the eyes what sort of hands and eyes has he wade reflected his range of observation was not large but within its limits it was exact and could give an account of itself hes worked a lot with his hands but thats not what they were made for i should say they were extraordinarily delicate conductors of sensation and his eye his eye too he hasnt used it to dominate people he didnt care to he simply looks through em all like windows makes me feel like the fellows who think theyre made of glass the mitigating circumstance is that he seems to see such a glorious landscape through me wade grinned at the thought of serving such a purpose i see ill come on sunday and be looked through bernald cried ii bernald came on two successive sundays and the second time he lingered till the tuesday here he comes wade had said the first evening as the two young men with wades mother sat in the sultry dusk with the virginian creeper drawing between the verandah arches its black arabesques against a moonlined sky in the darkness bernald heard a step on the gravel and saw the red flit of a cigar through the shrubs then a looselymoving figure obscured the patch of sky between the creepers and the red spark became the centre of a dim bearded face in which bernald discerned only a broad white gleam of forehead it was the young mans subsequent impression that winterman had not spoken much that first evening at any rate bernald himself remembered chiefly what the wades had said and this was the more curious because he had come for the purpose of studying their visitor and because there was nothing to divert him from that purpose in wades halting communications or his mothers artless comments he reflected afterward that there must have been a mysteriously fertilizing quality in the strangers silence it had brooded over their talk like a large moist cloud above a dry country mrs wade apparently apprehensive lest her son should have given bernald an exaggerated notion of their visitors importance had hastened to qualify it before the latter appeared hes not what you or howland would call intellectual bernald writhed at the coupling of the names not in the least literary though he told bob he used to write i dont think though it could have been what howland would call writing mrs wade always mentioned her younger son with a reverential drop of the voice she viewed literature much as she did providence as an inscrutably mystery and she spoke of howland as a dedicated being set apart to perform secret rites within the veil of the sanctuary i shouldnt say he had a quick mind she continued reverting apologetically to winterman sometimes he hardly seems to follow what were saying but hes got such sound ideas when he does speak hes never silly and clever people sometimes are dont you think so bernald groaned an unqualified assent and hes so capable the other day something went wrong with the kitchen range just as i was expecting some friends of bobs for dinner and do you know when mr winterman heard we were in trouble he came and took a look and knew at once what to do i told him it was a dreadful pity he wasnt married close on midnight when the session on the verandah ended and the two young men were strolling down to the bungalow at wintermans side bernalds mind reverted to the image of the fertilizing cloud there was something brooding pregnant in the silent presence beside him he had in place of any circumscribing impression of the individual a large hovering sense of manifold latent meanings and he felt a distinct thrill of relief when halfway down the lawn doctor bob was checked by a voice that called him back to the telephone now ill be with him alone thought bernald with a throb like a lovers in the lowceilinged bungalow winterman had to grope for the lamp on his desk and as its light struck up into his face bernalds sense of the rareness of his opportunity increased he couldnt have said why for the face with its ridged brows its shabby greyish beard and blunt socratic nose made no direct appeal to the eye it seemed rather like a stage on which remarkable things might be enacted like some shaggy moorland landscape dependent for form and expression on the clouds rolling over it and the bursts of light between and one of these flashed out in the smile with which winterman as if in answer to his companions thought said simply as he turned to fill his pipe now well talk so hed known all along that they hadnt yet and had guessed that with bernald one might the young mans glow of pleasure was so intense that it left him for a moment unable to meet the challenge and in that moment he felt the brush of something winged and summoning his spirit rose to it with a rush but just as he felt himself poised between the ascending pinions the door opened and bob wade plunged in too bad im so sorry it was from howland to say he cant come tomorrow after all the doctor panted out his news with honest grief i tried my best to pull it off for you and my brother wants to come hes keen to talk to you and see what he can do but you see hes so tremendously in demand hell try for another sunday later on winterman nodded with a whimsical gesture oh hell find me here i shall work my time out slowly he pointed to the scattered sheets on the kitchen table which formed his writing desk not slowly enough to suit us wade answered hospitably only if howland could have come he might have given you a tip or two put you on the right track shown you how to get in touch with the public winterman his hands in his sagging pockets lounged against the bare pine walls twisting his pipe under his beard does your brother enjoy the privilege of that contact he questioned gravely wade stared a little oh of course howlands not what youd call a popular writer he despises that kind of thing but whatever he says goes with well with the chaps that count and every one tells me hes written the book on pellerin you must read it when you get back your eyes he paused as if to let the name sink in but winterman drew at his pipe with a blank face you must have heard of pellerin i suppose the doctor continued ive never read a word of him myself hes too big a proposition for me but one cant escape the talk about him i have him crammed down my throat even in hospital the internes read him at the clinics he tumbles out of the nurses pockets the patients keep him under their pillows oh with most of them of course its just a craze like the last new game or puzzle they dont understand him in the least howland says that even now twentyfive years after his death and with his books in everybodys hands there are not twenty people who really understand pellerin and howland ought to know if anybody does hes whats their great word interpreted him you must get howland to put you through a course of pellerin and as the young men having taken leave of winterman retraced their way across the lawn wade continued to develop the theme of his brothers accomplishments i wish i could get howland to take an interest in winterman this is the third sunday hes chucked us of course he does get bored with people consulting him about their writings but i believe if he could only talk to winterman hed see something in him as we do and it would be such a godsend to the poor man to have some one to advise him about his work im going to make a desperate effort to get howland here next sunday it was then that bernald vowed to himself that he would return the next sunday at all costs he hardly knew whether he was prompted by the impulse to shield winterman from howland wades ineptitude or by the desire to see the latter abandon himself to the full shamelessness of its display but of one fact he was blissfully assured and that was of the existence in winterman of some quality which would provoke howland to the amplest exercise of his fatuity how hell draw him how hell draw him bernald chuckled with a security the more unaccountable that his one glimpse of winterman had shown the latter only as a passive subject for experimentation and he felt himself avenged in advance for the injury of howland wades existence iii that this hope was to be frustrated bernald learned from howland wades own lips the day before the two young men were to meet at portchester i cant really my dear fellow the interpreter lisped passing a polished hand over the faded smoothness of his face oh an authentic engagement i assure you otherwise to oblige old bob id submit cheerfully to looking over his foundlings literature but im pledged this week to the pellerin society of kenosha i had a hand in founding it and for two years now theyve been patiently waiting for a word from me the fiat lux so to speak you see its a ministry bernald i assure you i look upon my calling quite religiously as bernald listened his disappointment gradually changed to relief howland on trial always turned out to be too insufferable and the pleasure of watching his antics was invariably lost in the impulse to put a sanguinary end to them if hed only keep his beastly pink hands off pellerin bernald groaned thinking of the thick manuscript condemned to perpetual incarceration in his own desk by the publication of howlands definitive work on the great man one couldnt after howland wade expose ones self to the derision of writing about pellerin the eagerness with which wades book had been devoured proved not that the public had enough appetite for another but simply that for a stomach so undiscriminating anything better than wade had given it would be too good and bernald in the confidence that his own work was open to this objection had stoically locked it up yet if he had resigned his exasperated intelligence to the fact that wades book existed and was already passing into the immortality of perpetual republication he could not after repeated trials adjust himself to the authors talk about pellerin when wade wrote of the great dead he was egregious but in conversation he was familiar and fond it might have been supposed that one of the beauties of pellerins hidden life and mysterious taking off would have been to guard him from the fingering of anecdote but biographers like howland wade were born to rise above such obstacles he might be vague or inaccurate in dealing with the few recorded events of his subjects life but when he left fact for conjecture no one had a firmer footing whole chapters in his volume were constructed in the conditional mood and packed with hypothetical detail and in talk by the very law of the process hypothesis became affirmation and he was ready to tell you confidentially the exact circumstances of pellerins death and of the distressing incident leading up to it bernald himself not only questioned the form under which this incident was shaping itself before posterity but the mere radical fact of its occurrence he had never been able to discover any break in the dense cloud enveloping pellerins later life and its mysterious termination he had gone away that was all that any of them knew he who had so little at any time been with them or of them and his going had so slightly stirred the public consciousness that even the subsequent news of his death laconically imparted from afar had dropped unheeded into the universal scrapbasket to be long afterward fished out with all its details missing when some enquiring spirit first became aware by chance encounter with a twopenny volume in a london bookstall not only that such a man as john pellerin had died but that he had ever lived or written it need hardly be noted that howland wade had not been the pioneer in question his had been the wiser part of swelling the chorus when it rose and gradually drowning the other voices by his own insistent note he had pitched the note so screamingly and held it so long that he was now the accepted authority on pellerin not only in the land which had given birth to his genius but in the europe which had first acclaimed it and it was the central point of pain in bernalds sense of the situation that a man who had so yearned for silence as pellerin should have his grave piped over by such a voice as wades bernalds talk with the interpreter had revived this ache to the momentary exclusion of other sensations and he was still sore with it when the next afternoon he arrived at portchester for his second sunday with the wades at the station he had the surprise of seeing wintermans face on the platform and of hearing from him that doctor bob had been called away to assist at an operation in a distant town mrs wade wanted to put you off but i believe the message came too late so she sent me down to break the news to you said winterman holding out his hand perhaps because they were the first conventional words that bernald had heard him speak the young man was struck by the relief his intonation gave them she wanted to send a carriage winterman added but i told her wed walk back through the woods he looked at bernald with a sudden kindness that flushed the young man with pleasure are you strong enough its not too far oh no im pulling myself together getting back to work is the slowest part of the business not on account of my eyes i can use them now though not for reading but some of the links between things are missing its a kind of broken spectrum here that boy will look after your bag the walk through the woods remained in bernalds memory as an enchanted hour he used the word literally as descriptive of the way in which wintermans contact changed the face of things or perhaps restored them to their primitive meanings and the scene they traversed one of those little untended woods that still in america fringe the tawdry skirts of civilization acquired as a background to winterman the hush of a spot aware of transcendent visitings did he talk or did he make bernald talk the young man never knew he recalled only a sense of lightness and liberation as if the hard walls of individuality had melted and he were merged in the poets deeper interfusion yet without losing the least sharp edge of self this general impression resolved itself afterward into the sense of wintermans wide elemental range his thought encircled things like the horizon at sea he didnt as it happened touch on lofty themes bernald was gleefully aware that to howland wade their talk would hardly have been talk at all but wintermans mind applied to lowly topics was like a powerful lens that brought out microscopic delicacies and differences the lack of sunday trains kept doctor bob for two days on the scene of his surgical duties and during those two days bernald seized every moment of communion with his friends guest winterman as wade had said was reticent as to his personal affairs or rather as to the practical and material conditions to which the term is generally applied but it was evident that in wintermans case the usual classification must be reversed and that the discussion of ideas carried one much farther into his intimacy than any specific acquaintance with the incidents of his life thats exactly what howland wade and his tribe have never understood about pellerin that its much less important to know how or even why he disapp bernald pulled himself up with a jerk and turned to look full at his companion it was late on the monday evening and the two men after an hours chat on the verandah to the tune of mrs wades knittingneedles had bidden their hostess goodnight and strolled back to the bungalow together come and have a pipe before you turn in winterman had said and they had sat on together till midnight with the door of the bungalow open on a heaving moonlit bay and summer insects bumping against the chimney of the lamp winterman had just bent down to refill his pipe from the jar on the table and bernald jerking about to catch him in the yellow circle of lamplight sat speechless staring at a fact that seemed suddenly to have substituted itself for wintermans face or rather to have taken on its features no they never saw that pellerins ideas were pellerin he continued to stare at winterman just as this mans ideas are why are pellerin the thought uttered itself in a kind of inner shout and bernald started upright with the violent impact of his conclusion again and again in the last fortyeight hours he had exclaimed to himself this is as good as pellerin why hadnt he said till now this is pellerin surprising as the answer was he had no choice but to take it he hadnt said so simply because winterman was better than pellerin that there was so much more of him so to speak yes but it came to bernald in a flash wouldnt there by this time have been any amount more of pellerin the young man felt actually dizzy with the thought that was it there was the solution of the haunting problem this man was pellerin and more than pellerin it was so fantastic and yet so unanswerable that he burst into a sudden startled laugh winterman at the same moment brought his palm down with a sudden crash on the pile of manuscript covering the desk whats the matter bernald gasped my match wasnt out in another minute the destruction of the library of alexandria would have been a trifle compared to what youd have seen winterman with his large deep laugh shook out the smouldering sheets and i should have been a pensioner on doctor bob the lord knows how much longer bernald pulled himself together youve really got going again the things actually getting into shape this particular thing is in shape i drove at it hard all last week thinking our friends brother would be down on sunday and might look it over bernald had to repress the tendency to another wild laugh howland you meant to show howland what youve done winterman looming against the moonlight slowly turned a dusky shaggy head toward him isnt it a good thing to do bernald wavered torn between loyalty to his friends and the grotesqueness of answering in the affirmative after all it was none of his business to furnish winterman with an estimate of howland wade well you see youve never told me what your line is he answered temporizing no because nobodys ever told me its exactly what i want to find out said the other genially and you expect wade why i gathered from our good doctor that its his trade doesnt he explain interpret in his own domain which is pellerinism winterman gazed out musingly upon the moontouched dusk of waters and what is pellerinism he asked bernald sprang to his feet with a cry ah i dont know but youre pellerin they stood for a minute facing each other among the uncertain swaying shadows of the room with the sea breathing through it as something immense and inarticulate breathed through young bernalds thoughts then winterman threw up his arms with a humorous gesture dont shoot he said iv dawn found them there and the risen sun laid its beams on the rough floor of the bungalow before either of the men was conscious of the passage of time bernald vaguely trying to define his own state in retrospect could only phrase it i floated floated the gist of fact at the core of the extraordinary experience was simply that john pellerin twentyfive years earlier had voluntarily disappeared causing the rumour of his death to be reported to an inattentive world and that now he had come back to see what that world had made of him youll hardly believe it of me i hardly believe it of myself but i went away in a rage of disappointment of wounded pride no vanity i dont know which cut deepest the sneers or the silence but between them there wasnt an inch of me that wasnt raw i had just the one thing in me the message the cry the revelation but nobody saw and nobody listened nobody wanted what i had to give i was like a poor devil of a tramp looking for shelter on a bitter night in a town with every door bolted and all the windows dark and suddenly i felt that the easiest thing would be to lie down and go to sleep in the snow perhaps id a vague notion that if they found me there at daylight frozen stiff the pathetic spectacle might produce a reaction a feeling of remorse so i took care to be found well a good many thousand people die every day on the face of the globe and i soon discovered that i was simply one of the thousands and when i made that discovery i really died and stayed dead a year or two when i came to life again i was off on the under side of the world in regions unaware of what we know as the public have you any notion how it shifts the point of view to wake under new constellations i advise any whos been in love with a woman under cassiopeia to go and think about her under the southern cross its the only way to tell the pivotal truths from the others i didnt believe in my theory any less there was my triumph and my vindication it held out resisted measured itself with the stars but i didnt care a snap of my finger whether anybody else believed in it or even knew it had been formulated it escaped out of my books my poor stillborn books like psyche from the chrysalis and soared away into the blue and lived there i knew then how it frees an idea to be ignored how apprehension circumscribes and deforms it once id learned that it was easy enough to turn to and shift for myself i was sure now that my idea would live the good ones are selfsupporting i had to learn to be so and i tried my hand at a number of things adventurous menial commercial its not a bad thing for a man to have to live his life and we nearly all manage to dodge it our first round with the sphinx may strike something out of us a book or a picture or a symphony and were amazed at our feat and go on letting that first work breed others as some animal forms reproduce each other without renewed fertilization so there we are committed to our first guess at the riddle and our works look as like as successive impressions of the same plate each with the lines a little fainter whereas they ought to be if we touch earth between times as different from each other as those other creatures jellyfish arent they of a kind where successive generations produce new forms and it takes a zoologist to see the hidden likeness well i proved my first guess off there in the wilds and it lived and grew and took care of itself and i said some day it will make itself heard but by that time my atoms will have waltzed into a new pattern then in cashmere one day i met a fellow in a caravan with a dogeared book in his pocket he said he never stirred without it wanted to know where id been never to have heard of it it was my guess in its twentieth edition the globe spun round at that and all of a sudden i was under the old stars thats the way it happens when the ballast of vanity shifts id lived a third of a life out there unconscious of human opinion because i supposed it was unconscious of me but now now oh it was different i wanted to know what they said not exactly that either i wanted to know what id made them say theres a difference and here i am said john pellerin with a pull at his pipe so much bernald retained of his companions actual narrative the rest was swept away under the tide of wonder that rose and submerged him as pellerin at some indefinitely later stage of their talk picked up his manuscript and began to read bernald sat opposite his elbows propped on the table his eyes fixed on the swaying waters outside from which the moon gradually faded leaving them to make a denser blackness in the night as pellerin read this density of blackness which never for a moment seemed inert or unalive was attenuated by imperceptible degrees till a greyish pallour replaced it then the pallour breathed and brightened and suddenly dawn was on the sea something of the same nature went on in the young mans mind while he watched and listened he was conscious of a gradually withdrawing light of an interval of obscurity full of the stir of invisible forces and then of the victorious flush of day and as the light rose he saw how far he had travelled and what wonders the night had prepared pellerin had been right in saying that his first idea had survived had borne the test of time but he had given his hearer no hint of the extent to which it had been enlarged and modified of the fresh implications it now unfolded in a brief flash of retrospection bernald saw the earlier books dwindle and fall into their place as mere precursors of this fuller revelation then with a leap of helpless rage he pictured howland wades pink hands on the new treasure and his prophetic feet upon the lecture platform v it wont do oh he let him down as gently as possible but it appears it simply wont do doctor bob imparted the ineluctable fact to bernald while the two men accidentally meeting at their club a few nights later sat together over the dinner they had immediately agreed to consume in company bernald had left portchester the morning after his strange discovery and he and bob wade had not seen each other since and now bernald moved by an irresistible instinct of postponement had waited for his companion to bring up wintermans name and had even executed several conversational diversions in the hope of delaying its mention for how could one talk of winterman with the thought of pellerin swelling ones breast yes the very day howland got back from kenosha i brought the manuscript to town and got him to read it and yesterday evening i nailed him and dragged an answer out of him then howland hasnt seen winterman yet no he said before you let him loose on me ill go over the stuff and see if its at all worth while bernald drew a freer breath and he found it wasnt between ourselves he found it was of no account at all queer isnt it when the man but of course literatures another proposition howland says its one of the cases where an idea might seem original and striking if one didnt happen to be able to trace its descent and this is straight out of bosh by pellerin yes pellerin it seems that everything in the article that isnt pure nonsense is just pellerinism howland thinks poor winterman must have been tremendously struck by pellerins writings and have lived too much out of the world to know that theyve become the textbooks of modern thought otherwise of course hed have taken more trouble to disguise his plagiarisms i see bernald mused yet you say there is an original element yes but unluckily its no good its not conceivably in any sense a development of pellerins idea a logical step farther logical howland says its twaddle at white heat bernald sat silent divided between the fierce satisfaction of seeing the interpreter rush upon his fate and the despair of knowing that the state of mind he represented was indestructible then both emotions were swept away on a wave of pure joy as he reflected that now at last howland wade had given him back john pellerin the possession was one he did not mean to part with lightly and the dread of its being torn from him constrained him to extraordinary precautions youve told winterman i suppose how did he take it why unexpectedly as he does most things you can never tell which way hell jump i thought hed take a high tone or else laugh it off but he did neither he seemed awfully cast down i wished myself well out of the job when i saw how cut up he was bernald thrilled at the words pellerin had shared his pang then the old woe of the world at the perpetuity of human dulness but what did he say to the charge of plagiarism if you made it oh i told him straight out what howland said i thought it fairer and his answer to that was the rummest part of all what was it bernald questioned with a tremor he said thats queer for ive never read pellerin bernald drew a deep breath of ecstasy well and i suppose you believed him i believed him because i know him but the public wont the critics wont and if its a pure coincidence its just as bad for him as if it were a straight steal isnt it bernald sighed his acquiescence it bothers me awfully wade continued knitting his kindly brows because i could see what a blow it was to him hes got to earn his living and i dont suppose he knows how to do anything else at his age its hard to start fresh i put that to howland asked him if there wasnt a chance he might do better if he only had a little encouragement i cant help feeling hes got the essential thing in him but of course im no judge when it comes to books and howland says it would be cruel to give him any hope wade paused turned his wineglass about under a meditative stare and then leaned across the table toward bernald look here do you know what ive proposed to winterman that he should come to town with me tomorrow and go in the evening to hear howland lecture to the uplift club theyre to meet at mrs beecher bains and howland is to repeat the lecture that he gave the other day before the pellerin society at kenosha it will give winterman a chance to get some notion of what pellerin was hell get it much straighter from howland than if he tried to plough through pellerins books and then afterward as if accidentally i thought i might bring him and howland together if howland could only see him and hear him talk theres no knowing what might come of it he couldnt help feeling the mans force as we do and he might give him a pointer tell him what line to take anyhow it would please winterman and take the edge off his disappointment i saw that as soon as i proposed it some one whos never heard of pellerin mrs beecher bain large smiling diffuse reached out parenthetically from the incoming throng on her threshold to waylay bernald with the question as he was about to move past her in the wake of his companion oh keep straight on mr winterman she interrupted herself to call after the latter into the back drawingroom please and remember youre to sit next to me in the corner on the left close under the platform she renewed her interrogative clutch on bernalds sleeve most curious doctor wade has been telling me all about him how remarkable you all think him and its actually true that hes never heard of pellerin of course as soon as doctor wade told me that i said bring him it will be so extraordinarily interesting to watch the first impression yes do follow him dear mr bernald and be sure that you and he secure the seats next to me of course alice fosdick insists on being with us she was wild with excitement when i told her she was to meet some one whod never heard of pellerin on the indulgent lips of mrs beecher bain conjecture speedily passed into affirmation and as bernalds companion broad and shaggy in his visibly new evening clothes moved down the length of the crowded rooms he was already to the ladies drawing aside their skirts to let him pass the interesting huron of the fable how far he was aware of the character ascribed to him it was impossible for bernald to discover he was as unconscious as a tree or a cloud and his observer had never known any one so alive to human contacts and yet so secure from them but the scene was playing such a lively tune on bernalds own sensibilities that for the moment he could not adjust himself to the probable effect it produced on his companion the young man of late had made but rare appearances in the group of which mrs beecher bain was one of the most indefatigable hostesses and the uplift club the chief medium of expression to a critic obliged by his trade to cultivate convictions it was the essence of luxury to leave them at home in his hours of ease and bernald gave his preference to circles in which less finality of judgment prevailed and it was consequently less embarrassing to be caught without an opinion but in his fresher days he had known the spell of the uplift club and the thrill of moving among the emancipated and he felt an odd sense of rejuvenation as he looked at the rows of faces packed about the embowered platform from which howland wade was presently to hand down the eternal verities many of these countenances belonged to the old days when the gospel of pellerin was unknown and it required considerable intellectual courage to avow ones acceptance of the very doctrines he had since demolished the latter moral revolution seemed to have been accepted as submissively as a change in hairdressing and it even struck bernald that in the case of many of the assembled ladies their convictions were rather newer than their clothes one of the most interesting examples of this facility of adaptation was actually in the person of miss alice fosdick brushing his elbow with exotic amulets and enveloping him in arabian odours as she leaned forward to murmur her sympathetic sense of the situation miss fosdick who was one of the most advanced exponents of pellerinism had large eyes and a plaintive mouth and bernald had always fancied that she might have been pretty if she had not been perpetually explaining things yes i know isabella bain told me all about him he cant hear us can he and i wonder if you realize how remarkably interesting it is that we should have such an opportunity now i mean the opportunity to see the impression of pellerinism on a perfectly fresh mind you must introduce him as soon as the lectures over i explained that to isabella as soon as she showed me doctor wades note of course you see why dont you bernald made a faint motion of acquiescence which she instantly swept aside at least i think i can make you see why if youre sure he cant hear why its just this pellerinism is in danger of becoming a truism oh its an awful thing to say but then im not afraid of saying awful things i rather believe its my mission what i mean is that were getting into the way of taking pellerin for granted as we do the air we breathe we dont sufficiently lead our conscious life in him were gradually letting him become subliminal she swayed closer to the young man and he saw that she was making a graceful attempt to throw her explanatory net over his companion who evading mrs bains hospitable signal had cautiously wedged himself into a seat between bernald and the wall did you hear what i was saying mr winterman yes i know who you are of course oh well i dont really mind if you did i was talking about you about you and pellerin i was explaining to mr bernald that what we need at this very minute is a pellerin revival and we need some one like you to whom his message comes as a wonderful new interpretation of life to lead the revival and rouse us out of our apathy you see she went on winningly its not only the big public that needs it of course their pellerin isnt ours its we his disciples his interpreters who discovered him and gave him to the world we the chosen people the custodians of the sacred books as howland wade calls us its we who are in perpetual danger of sinking back into the old stagnant ideals and practising the seven deadly virtues its we who need to count our mercies and realize anew what hes done for us and what we ought to do for him and its for that reason that i urged mr wade to speak here in the very inner sanctuary of pellerinism exactly as he would speak to the uninitiated to repeat simply his kenosha lecture what pellerinism means and we ought all i think to listen to him with the hearts of little children just as you will mr winterman as if he were telling us new things and we alice dear mrs bain murmured with a deprecating gesture and howland wade emerging between the palms took the centre of the platform a pang of commiseration shot through bernald as he saw him there so innocent and so exposed his plump pulpy body which made his evening dress fall into intimate and wrapperlike folds was like a wide surface spread to the shafts of irony and the mild ripples of his voice seemed to enlarge the vulnerable area as he leaned forward poised on confidential fingertips to say persuasively let me try to tell you what pellerinism means bernald moved restlessly in his seat he had the obscure sense of being a party to something not wholly honourable he ought not to have come he ought not to have let his companion come yet how could he have done otherwise john pellerins secret was his own as long as he chose to remain john winterman it was no ones business to gainsay him and bernalds scruples were really justifiable only in respect of his own presence on the scene but even in this connection he ceased to feel them as soon as howland wade began to speak vi it had been arranged that pellerin after the meeting of the uplift club should join bernald at his rooms and spend the night there instead of returning to portchester the plan had been eagerly elaborated by the young man but he had been unprepared for the alacrity with which his wonderful friend accepted it he was beginning to see that it was a part of pellerins wonderfulness to fall in quite simply and naturally with any arrangements made for his convenience or tending to promote the convenience of others bernald felt that his extreme docility in such matters was proportioned to the force of resistance which for nearly half a lifetime had kept him with his back to the wall fighting alone against the powers of darkness in such a scale of values how little the small daily alternatives must weigh at the close of howland wades discourse bernald charged with his prodigious secret had felt the need to escape for an instant from the liberated rush of talk the interest of watching pellerin was so perilously great that the watcher felt it might at any moment betray him he lingered in the crowded drawingroom long enough to see his friend enclosed in a mounting tide above which mrs beecher bain and miss fosdick actively waved their conversational tridents then he took refuge at the back of the house in a small dim library where in his younger days he had discussed personal immortality and the problem of consciousness with beautiful girls whose names he could not remember in this retreat he surprised mr beecher bain a quiet man with a mild brow who was smoking a surreptitious cigar over the last number of the strand mr bain at bernalds approach dissembled the strand under a copy of the hibbert journal but tendered his cigarcase with the remark that stocks were heavy again and bernald blissfully abandoned himself to this unexpected contact with reality on his return to the drawingroom he found that the tide had set toward the suppertable and when it finally carried him thither it was to land him in the welcoming arms of bob wade hullo old man where have you been all this time winterman oh hes talking to howland yes i managed it finally i believe mrs bain has steered them into the library so that they shant be disturbed i gave her an idea of the situation and she was awfully kind wed better leave them alone dont you think im trying to get a croquette for miss fosdick bernalds secret leapt in his bosom and he devoted himself to the task of distributing sandwiches and champagne while his pulses danced to the tune of the cosmic laughter the vision of pellerin and his interpreter face to face at last had a cyclopean grandeur that dwarfed all other comedy and i shall hear of it presently in an hour or two hell be telling me about it and that hour will be all mine mine and his the dizziness of the thought made it difficult for bernald to preserve the balance of the supperplates he was distributing life had for him at that moment the completeness which seems to defy disintegration the throng in the diningroom was thickening and bernalds efforts as purveyor were interrupted by frequent appeals from ladies who had reached repleteness that he should sit down a moment and tell them all about his interesting friend wintermans fame trumpeted abroad by miss fosdick had reached the four corners of the uplift club and bernald found himself fabricating de toutes pieces a winterman legend which should in some degree respond to the clubs demand for the human document when at length he had acquitted himself of this obligation and was free to work his way back through the lessening groups into the drawingroom he was at last rewarded by a glimpse of his friend who still densely encompassed towered in the centre of the room in all his sovran ugliness their eyes met across the crowd but bernald gathered only perplexity from the encounter what were pellerins eyes saying to him what orders what confidences what indefinable apprehension did their long look impart the young man was still trying to decipher their complex message when he felt a tap on the arm and turned to encounter the rueful gaze of bob wade whose meaning lay clearly enough on the surface of his good blue stare well it wont work it wont work the doctor groaned what wont i mean with howland winterman wont howland doesnt take to him says hes crude frightfully crude and you know how howland hates crudeness oh i know bernald exulted it was the word he had waited for he saw it now once more he was lost in wonder at howlands miraculous faculty for always as the naturalists said being true to type so im afraid its all up with his chance of writing at least i can do no more said wade discouraged bernald pressed him for farther details does winterman seem to mind much did you hear his version his version i mean what he said to howland why no what the deuce was there for him to say what indeed i think ill take him home said bernald gaily he turned away to join the circle from which a few minutes before pellerins eyes had vainly and enigmatically signalled to him but the circle had dispersed and pellerin himself was not in sight bernald looking about him saw that during his brief aside with wade the party had passed into the final phase of dissolution people still delayed in diminishing groups but the current had set toward the doors and every moment or two it bore away a few more lingerers bernald from his post commanded the clearing perspective of the two drawingrooms and a rapid survey of their length sufficed to assure him that pellerin was not in either taking leave of wade the young man made his way back to the drawingroom where only a few hardened feasters remained and then passed on to the library which had been the scene of the late momentous colloquy but the library too was empty and drifting back uncertainly to the inner drawingroom bernald found mrs beecher bain domestically putting out the wax candles on the mantelpiece dear mr bernald do sit down and have a little chat what a wonderful privilege it has been i dont know when ive had such an intense impression she made way for him hospitably in a corner of the sofa to which she had sunk and he echoed her vaguely you were impressed then i cant express to you how it affected me as alice said it was a resurrection it was as if john pellerin were actually here in the room with us bernald turned on her with a halfaudible gasp you felt that dear mrs bain we all felt it every one of us i dont wonder the greeks it was the greeks regarded eloquence as a supernatural power as alice says when one looked at howland wade one understood what they meant by the afflatus bernald rose and held out his hand oh i see it was howland who made you feel as if pellerin were in the room and he made miss fosdick feel so too why of course but why are you rushing off because i must hunt up my friend whos not used to such late hours your friend mrs bain had to collect her thoughts oh mr winterman you mean but hes gone already gone bernald exclaimed with an odd twinge of foreboding remembering pellerins signal across the crowd he reproached himself for not having answered it more promptly yet it was certainly strange that his friend should have left the house without him are you quite sure he asked with a startled glance at the clock oh perfectly he went half an hour ago but you neednt hurry home on his account for alice fosdick carried him off with her i saw them leave together carried him off she took him home with her you mean yes you know what strange hours she keeps she told me she was going to give him a welsh rabbit and explain pellerinism to him oh if shes going to explain bernald murmured but his amazement at the news struggled with a confused impatience to reach his rooms in time to be there for his friends arrival there could be no stranger spectacle beneath the stars than that of john pellerin carried off by miss fosdick and listening in the small hours to her elucidation of his doctrines but bernald knew enough of his sex to be aware that such an experiment may present a less humorous side to its subject than to an impartial observer even the uplift club and its connotations might benefit by the attraction of the unknown and it was conceivable that to a traveller from mesopotamia miss fosdick might present elements of interest which she had lost for the frequenters of fifth avenue there was at any rate no denying that the affair had become unexpectedly complex and that its farther development promised to be rich in comedy in the charmed contemplation of these possibilities bernald sat over his fire listening for pellerins ring he had arranged his modest quarters with the reverent care of a celebrant awaiting the descent of his deity he guessed pellerin to be unconscious of visual detail but sensitive to the happy blending of sensuous impressions to the intimate spell of lamplight on books and of a deep chair placed where one could watch the fire the chair was there and bernald facing it across the hearth already saw it filled by pellerins lounging figure the autumn dawn came late and even now they had before them the promise of some untroubled hours bernald sitting there alone in the warm stillness of his room and in the profounder hush of his expectancy was conscious of gathering up all his sensibilities and perceptions into one exquisitelyadjusted instrument of notation until now he had tasted pellerins society only in unpremeditated snatches and had always left him with a sense on his own part of waste and shortcoming now in the lull of this dedicated hour he felt that he should miss nothing and forget nothing of the initiation that awaited him and catching sight of pellerins pipe he rose and laid it carefully on a table by the armchair no ive never had any news of him bernald heard himself repeating he spoke in a low tone and with the automatic utterance that alone made it possible to say the words they were addressed to miss fosdick into whose neighbourhood chance had thrown him at a dinner a year or so later than their encounter at the uplift club hitherto he had successfully and intentionally avoided miss fosdick not from any animosity toward that unconscious instrument of fate but from an intense reluctance to pronounce the words which he knew he should have to speak if they met now as it turned out his chief surprise was that she should wait so long to make him speak them all through the dinner she had swept him along on a rapid current of talk which showed no tendency to linger or turn back upon the past at first he ascribed her reserve to a sense of delicacy with which he reproached himself for not having previously credited her then he saw that she had been carried so far beyond the point at which they had last faced each other that it was by the merest hazard of associated ideas that she was now finally borne back to it for it appeared that the very next evening at mrs beecher bains a hindu mahatma was to lecture to the uplift club on the limits of the subliminal and it was owing to no less a person than howland wade that this exceptional privilege had been obtained of course howlands known all over the world as the interpreter of pellerinism and the aga gautch who had absolutely declined to speak anywhere in public wrote to isabella that he could not refuse anything that mr wade asked did you know that howlands lecture what pellerinism means has been translated into twentytwo languages and gone into a fifth edition in icelandic why that reminds me miss fosdick broke off ive never heard what became of your queer friend what was his name whom you and bob wade accused me of spiriting away after that very lecture and ive never seen you since you rushed into the house the next morning and dragged me out of bed to know what id done with him with a sharp effort bernald gathered himself together to have it out well what did you do with him he retorted she laughed her appreciation of his humour just what i told you of course i said goodbye to him on isabellas doorstep bernald looked at her its really true then that he didnt go home with you she bantered back have you suspected me all this time of hiding his remains in the cellar and with a droop of her fine lids she added i wish he had come home with me for he was rather interesting and there were things i think i could have explained to him bernald helped himself to a nectarine and miss fosdick continued on a note of amused curiosity so youve really never had any news of him since that night no ive never had any news of him not the least little message not the least little message or a rumour or report of any kind or a rumour or report of any kind miss fosdicks interest seemed to be revived by the strangeness of the case its rather creepy isnt it what could have happened you dont suppose he could have been waylaid and murdered she asked with brightening eyes bernald shook his head serenely no im sure hes safe quite safe but if youre sure you must know something no i know nothing he repeated she scanned him incredulously but whats your theory for you must have a theory what in the world can have become of him bernald returned her look and hesitated do you happen to remember the last thing he said to you the very last on the doorstep when he left you the last thing she poised her fork above the peach on her plate i dont think he said anything oh yes when i reminded him that hed solemnly promised to come back with me and have a little talk he said he couldnt because he was going home well then i suppose said bernald he went home she glanced at him as if suspecting a trap dear me how flat i always inclined to a mysterious murder but of course you know more of him than you say she began to cut her peach but paused above a lifted bit to ask with a renewal of animation in her expressive eyes by the way had you heard that howland wade has been gradually getting farther and farther away from pellerinism it seems hes begun to feel that theres a positivist element in it which is narrowing to any one who has gone at all deeply into the wisdom of the east he was intensely interesting about it the other day and of course i do see what he feels oh its too long to tell you now but if you could manage to come in to tea some afternoon soon any day but wednesday i should so like to explain the eyes i we had been put in the mood for ghosts that evening after an excellent dinner at our old friend culwins by a tale of fred murchards the narrative of a strange personal visitation seen through the haze of our cigars and by the drowsy gleam of a coal fire culwins library with its oak walls and dark old bindings made a good setting for such evocations and ghostly experiences at first hand being after murchards brilliant opening the only kind acceptable to us we proceeded to take stock of our group and tax each member for a contribution there were eight of us and seven contrived in a manner more or less adequate to fulfil the condition imposed it surprised us all to find that we could muster such a show of supernatural impressions for none of us excepting murchard himself and young phil frenham whose story was the slightest of the lot had the habit of sending our souls into the invisible so that on the whole we had every reason to be proud of our seven exhibits and none of us would have dreamed of expecting an eighth from our host our old friend mr andrew culwin who had sat back in his armchair listening and blinking through the smoke circles with the cheerful tolerance of a wise old idol was not the kind of man likely to be favoured with such contacts though he had imagination enough to enjoy without envying the superior privileges of his guests by age and by education he belonged to the stout positivist tradition and his habit of thought had been formed in the days of the epic struggle between physics and metaphysics but he had been then and always essentially a spectator a humorous detached observer of the immense muddled variety show of life slipping out of his seat now and then for a brief dip into the convivialities at the back of the house but never as far as one knew showing the least desire to jump on the stage and do a turn among his contemporaries there lingered a vague tradition of his having at a remote period and in a romantic clime been wounded in a duel but this legend no more tallied with what we younger men knew of his character than my mothers assertion that he had once been a charming little man with nice eyes corresponded to any possible reconstitution of his dry thwarted physiognomy he never can have looked like anything but a bundle of sticks murchard had once said of him or a phosphorescent log rather some one else amended and we recognized the happiness of this description of his small squat trunk with the red blink of the eyes in a face like mottled bark he had always been possessed of a leisure which he had nursed and protected instead of squandering it in vain activities his carefully guarded hours had been devoted to the cultivation of a fine intelligence and a few judiciously chosen habits and none of the disturbances common to human experience seemed to have crossed his sky nevertheless his dispassionate survey of the universe had not raised his opinion of that costly experiment and his study of the human race seemed to have resulted in the conclusion that all men were superfluous and women necessary only because some one had to do the cooking on the importance of this point his convictions were absolute and gastronomy was the only science which he revered as dogma it must be owned that his little dinners were a strong argument in favour of this view besides being a reason though not the main one for the fidelity of his friends mentally he exercised a hospitality less seductive but no less stimulating his mind was like a forum or some open meetingplace for the exchange of ideas somewhat cold and draughty but light spacious and orderly a kind of academic grove from which all the leaves had fallen in this privileged area a dozen of us were wont to stretch our muscles and expand our lungs and as if to prolong as much as possible the tradition of what we felt to be a vanishing institution one or two neophytes were now and then added to our band young phil frenham was the last and the most interesting of these recruits and a good example of murchards somewhat morbid assertion that our old friend liked em juicy it was indeed a fact that culwin for all his mental dryness specially tasted the lyric qualities in youth as he was far too good an epicurean to nip the flowers of soul which he gathered for his garden his friendship was not a disintegrating influence on the contrary it forced the young idea to robuster bloom and in phil frenham he had a fine subject for experimentation the boy was really intelligent and the soundness of his nature was like the pure paste under a delicate glaze culwin had fished him out of a thick fog of family dulness and pulled him up to a peak in darien and the adventure hadnt hurt him a bit indeed the skill with which culwin had contrived to stimulate his curiosities without robbing them of their young bloom of awe seemed to me a sufficient answer to murchards ogreish metaphor there was nothing hectic in frenhams efflorescence and his old friend had not laid even a fingertip on the sacred stupidities one wanted no better proof of that than the fact that frenham still reverenced them in culwin theres a side of him you fellows dont see i believe that story about the duel he declared and it was of the very essence of this belief that it should impel him just as our little party was dispersing to turn back to our host with the absurd demand and now youve got to tell us about your ghost the outer door had closed on murchard and the others only frenham and i remained and the vigilant servant who presided over culwins destinies having brought a fresh supply of sodawater had been laconically ordered to bed culwins sociability was a nightblooming flower and we knew that he expected the nucleus of his group to tighten around him after midnight but frenhams appeal seemed to disconcert him comically and he rose from the chair in which he had just reseated himself after his farewells in the hall my ghost do you suppose im fool enough to go to the expense of keeping one of my own when there are so many charming ones in my friends closets take another cigar he said revolving toward me with a laugh frenham laughed too pulling up his slender height before the chimneypiece as he turned to face his short bristling friend oh he said youd never be content to share if you met one you really liked culwin had dropped back into his armchair his shock head embedded in its habitual hollow his little eyes glimmering over a fresh cigar liked liked good lord he growled ah you have then frenham pounced on him in the same instant with a sidewise glance of victory at me but culwin cowered gnomelike among his cushions dissembling himself in a protective cloud of smoke whats the use of denying it youve seen everything so of course youve seen a ghost his young friend persisted talking intrepidly into the cloud or if you havent seen one its only because youve seen two the form of the challenge seemed to strike our host he shot his head out of the mist with a queer tortoiselike motion he sometimes had and blinked approvingly at frenham yes he suddenly flung at us on a shrill jerk of laughter its only because ive seen two the words were so unexpected that they dropped down and down into a fathomless silence while we continued to stare at each other over culwins head and culwin stared at his ghosts at length frenham without speaking threw himself into the chair on the other side of the hearth and leaned forward with his listening smile ii oh of course theyre not show ghosts a collector wouldnt think anything of them dont let me raise your hopes their one merit is their numerical strength the exceptional fact of their being two but as against this im bound to admit that at any moment i could probably have exorcised them both by asking my doctor for a prescription or my oculist for a pair of spectacles only as i never could make up my mind whether to go to the doctor or the oculist whether i was afflicted by an optical or a digestive delusion i left them to pursue their interesting double life though at times they made mine exceedingly comfortable yes uncomfortable and you know how i hate to be uncomfortable but it was part of my stupid pride when the thing began not to admit that i could be disturbed by the trifling matter of seeing two and then id no reason really to suppose i was ill as far as i knew i was simply bored horribly bored but it was part of my boredom i remember that i was feeling so uncommonly well and didnt know how on earth to work off my surplus energy i had come back from a long journey down in south america and mexico and had settled down for the winter near new york with an old aunt who had known washington irving and corresponded with n p willis she lived not far from irvington in a damp gothic villa overhung by norway spruces and looking exactly like a memorial emblem done in hair her personal appearance was in keeping with this image and her own hair of which there was little left might have been sacrificed to the manufacture of the emblem i had just reached the end of an agitated year with considerable arrears to make up in money and emotion and theoretically it seemed as though my aunts mild hospitality would be as beneficial to my nerves as to my purse but the deuce of it was that as soon as i felt myself safe and sheltered my energy began to revive and how was i to work it off inside of a memorial emblem i had at that time the agreeable illusion that sustained intellectual effort could engage a mans whole activity and i decided to write a great book i forget about what my aunt impressed by my plan gave up to me her gothic library filled with classics in black cloth and daguerrotypes of faded celebrities and i sat down at my desk to make myself a place among their number and to facilitate my task she lent me a cousin to copy my manuscript the cousin was a nice girl and i had an idea that a nice girl was just what i needed to restore my faith in human nature and principally in myself she was neither beautiful nor intelligent poor alice nowell but it interested me to see any woman content to be so uninteresting and i wanted to find out the secret of her content in doing this i handled it rather rashly and put it out of joint oh just for a moment theres no fatuity in telling you this for the poor girl had never seen any one but cousins well i was sorry for what id done of course and confoundedly bothered as to how i should put it straight she was staying in the house and one evening after my aunt had gone to bed she came down to the library to fetch a book shed mislaid like any artless heroine on the shelves behind us she was pinknosed and flustered and it suddenly occurred to me that her hair though it was fairly thick and pretty would look exactly like my aunts when she grew older i was glad i had noticed this for it made it easier for me to do what was right and when i had found the book she hadnt lost i told her i was leaving for europe that week europe was terribly far off in those days and alice knew at once what i meant she didnt take it in the least as id expected it would have been easier if she had she held her book very tight and turned away a moment to wind up the lamp on my desk it had a ground glass shade with vine leaves and glass drops around the edge i remember then she came back held out her hand and said goodbye and as she said it she looked straight at me and kissed me i had never felt anything as fresh and shy and brave as her kiss it was worse than any reproach and it made me ashamed to deserve a reproach from her i said to myself ill marry her and when my aunt dies shell leave us this house and ill sit here at the desk and go on with my book and alice will sit over there with her embroidery and look at me as shes looking now and life will go on like that for any number of years the prospect frightened me a little but at the time it didnt frighten me as much as doing anything to hurt her and ten minutes later she had my seal ring on my finger and my promise that when i went abroad she should go with me youll wonder why im enlarging on this familiar incident its because the evening on which it took place was the very evening on which i first saw the queer sight ive spoken of being at that time an ardent believer in a necessary sequence between cause and effect i naturally tried to trace some kind of link between what had just happened to me in my aunts library and what was to happen a few hours later on the same night and so the coincidence between the two events always remained in my mind i went up to bed with rather a heavy heart for i was bowed under the weight of the first good action i had ever consciously committed and young as i was i saw the gravity of my situation dont imagine from this that i had hitherto been an instrument of destruction i had been merely a harmless young man who had followed his bent and declined all collaboration with providence now i had suddenly undertaken to promote the moral order of the world and i felt a good deal like the trustful spectator who has given his gold watch to the conjurer and doesnt know in what shape hell get it back when the trick is over still a glow of selfrighteousness tempered my fears and i said to myself as i undressed that when id got used to being good it probably wouldnt make me as nervous as it did at the start and by the time i was in bed and had blown out my candle i felt that i really was getting used to it and that as far as id got it was not unlike sinking down into one of my aunts very softest wool mattresses i closed my eyes on this image and when i opened them it must have been a good deal later for my room had grown cold and the night was intensely still i was waked suddenly by the feeling we all know the feeling that there was something near me that hadnt been there when i fell asleep i sat up and strained my eyes into the darkness the room was pitch black and at first i saw nothing but gradually a vague glimmer at the foot of the bed turned into two eyes staring back at me i couldnt see the face attached to them on account of the darkness i imagined but as i looked the eyes grew more and more distinct they gave out a light of their own the sensation of being thus gazed at was far from pleasant and you might suppose that my first impulse would have been to jump out of bed and hurl myself on the invisible figure attached to the eyes but it wasnt my impulse was simply to lie still i cant say whether this was due to an immediate sense of the uncanny nature of the apparition to the certainty that if i did jump out of bed i should hurl myself on nothing or merely to the benumbing effect of the eyes themselves they were the very worst eyes ive ever seen a mans eyes but what a man my first thought was that he must be frightfully old the orbits were sunk and the thick redlined lids hung over the eyeballs like blinds of which the cords are broken one lid drooped a little lower than the other with the effect of a crooked leer and between these pulpy folds of flesh with their scant bristle of lashes the eyes themselves small glassy disks with an agatelike rim about the pupils looked like seapebbles in the grip of a starfish but the age of the eyes was not the most unpleasant thing about them what turned me sick was their expression of vicious security i dont know how else to describe the fact that they seemed to belong to a man who had done a lot of harm in his life but had always kept just inside the danger lines they were not the eyes of a coward but of some one much too clever to take risks and my gorge rose at their look of base astuteness yet even that wasnt the worst for as we continued to scan each other i saw in them a tinge of faint derision and felt myself to be its object at that i was seized by an impulse of rage that jerked me out of bed and pitched me straight on the unseen figure at its foot but of course there wasnt any figure there and my fists struck at emptiness ashamed and cold i groped about for a match and lit the candles the room looked just as usual as i had known it would and i crawled back to bed and blew out the lights as soon as the room was dark again the eyes reappeared and i now applied myself to explaining them on scientific principles at first i thought the illusion might have been caused by the glow of the last embers in the chimney but the fireplace was on the other side of my bed and so placed that the fire could not possibly be reflected in my toilet glass which was the only mirror in the room then it occurred to me that i might have been tricked by the reflection of the embers in some polished bit of wood or metal and though i couldnt discover any object of the sort in my line of vision i got up again groped my way to the hearth and covered what was left of the fire but as soon as i was back in bed the eyes were back at its foot they were an hallucination then that was plain but the fact that they were not due to any external dupery didnt make them a bit pleasanter to see for if they were a projection of my inner consciousness what the deuce was the matter with that organ i had gone deeply enough into the mystery of morbid pathological states to picture the conditions under which an exploring mind might lay itself open to such a midnight admonition but i couldnt fit it to my present case i had never felt more normal mentally and physically and the only unusual fact in my situation that of having assured the happiness of an amiable girl did not seem of a kind to summon unclean spirits about my pillow but there were the eyes still looking at me i shut mine and tried to evoke a vision of alice nowells they were not remarkable eyes but they were as wholesome as fresh water and if she had had more imagination or longer lashes their expression might have been interesting as it was they did not prove very efficacious and in a few moments i perceived that they had mysteriously changed into the eyes at the foot of the bed it exasperated me more to feel these glaring at me through my shut lids than to see them and i opened my eyes again and looked straight into their hateful stare and so it went on all night i cant tell you what that night was nor how long it lasted have you ever lain in bed hopelessly wide awake and tried to keep your eyes shut knowing that if you opened em youd see something you dreaded and loathed it sounds easy but its devilish hard those eyes hung there and drew me i had the vertige de labime and their red lids were the edge of my abyss i had known nervous hours before hours when id felt the wind of danger in my neck but never this kind of strain it wasnt that the eyes were so awful they hadnt the majesty of the powers of darkness but they had how shall i say a physical effect that was the equivalent of a bad smell their look left a smear like a snails and i didnt see what business they had with me anyhow and i stared and stared trying to find out i dont know what effect they were trying to produce but the effect they did produce was that of making me pack my portmanteau and bolt to town early the next morning i left a note for my aunt explaining that i was ill and had gone to see my doctor and as a matter of fact i did feel uncommonly ill the night seemed to have pumped all the blood out of me but when i reached town i didnt go to the doctors i went to a friends rooms and threw myself on a bed and slept for ten heavenly hours when i woke it was the middle of the night and i turned cold at the thought of what might be waiting for me i sat up shaking and stared into the darkness but there wasnt a break in its blessed surface and when i saw that the eyes were not there i dropped back into another long sleep i had left no word for alice when i fled because i meant to go back the next morning but the next morning i was too exhausted to stir as the day went on the exhaustion increased instead of wearing off like the lassitude left by an ordinary night of insomnia the effect of the eyes seemed to be cumulative and the thought of seeing them again grew intolerable for two days i struggled with my dread but on the third evening i pulled myself together and decided to go back the next morning i felt a good deal happier as soon as id decided for i knew that my abrupt disappearance and the strangeness of my not writing must have been very painful for poor alice that night i went to bed with an easy mind and fell asleep at once but in the middle of the night i woke and there were the eyes well i simply couldnt face them and instead of going back to my aunts i bundled a few things into a trunk and jumped onto the first steamer for england i was so dead tired when i got on board that i crawled straight into my berth and slept most of the way over and i cant tell you the bliss it was to wake from those long stretches of dreamless sleep and look fearlessly into the darkness knowing that i shouldnt see the eyes i stayed abroad for a year and then i stayed for another and during that time i never had a glimpse of them that was enough reason for prolonging my stay if id been on a desert island another was of course that i had perfectly come to see on the voyage over the folly complete impossibility of my marrying alice nowell the fact that i had been so slow in making this discovery annoyed me and made me want to avoid explanations the bliss of escaping at one stroke from the eyes and from this other embarrassment gave my freedom an extraordinary zest and the longer i savoured it the better i liked its taste the eyes had burned such a hole in my consciousness that for a long time i went on puzzling over the nature of the apparition and wondering nervously if it would ever come back but as time passed i lost this dread and retained only the precision of the image then that faded in its turn the second year found me settled in rome where i was planning i believe to write another great book a definitive work on etruscan influences in italian art at any rate id found some pretext of the kind for taking a sunny apartment in the piazza di spagna and dabbling about indefinitely in the forum and there one morning a charming youth came to me as he stood there in the warm light slender and smooth and hyacinthine he might have stepped from a ruined altar one to antinous say but hed come instead from new york with a letter of all people from alice nowell the letter the first id had from her since our break was simply a line introducing her young cousin gilbert noyes and appealing to me to befriend him it appeared poor lad that he had talent and wanted to write and an obdurate family having insisted that his calligraphy should take the form of double entry alice had intervened to win him six months respite during which he was to travel on a meagre pittance and somehow prove his ultimate ability to increase it by his pen the quaint conditions of the test struck me first it seemed about as conclusive as a mediaeval ordeal then i was touched by her having sent him to me i had always wanted to do her some service to justify myself in my own eyes rather than hers and here was a beautiful embodiment of my chance well i imagine its safe to lay down the general principle that predestined geniuses dont as a rule appear before one in the spring sunshine of the forum looking like one of its banished gods at any rate poor noyes wasnt a predestined genius but he was beautiful to see and charming as a comrade too it was only when he began to talk literature that my heart failed me i knew all the symptoms so well the things he had in him and the things outside him that impinged theres the real test after all it was always punctually inevitably with the inexorableness of a mechanical law it was always the wrong thing that struck him i grew to find a certain grim fascination in deciding in advance exactly which wrong thing hed select and i acquired an astonishing skill at the game the worst of it was that his betise wasnt of the too obvious sort ladies who met him at picnics thought him intellectual and even at dinners he passed for clever i who had him under the microscope fancied now and then that he might develop some kind of a slim talent something that he could make do and be happy on and wasnt that after all what i was concerned with he was so charming he continued to be so charming that he called forth all my charity in support of this argument and for the first few months i really believed there was a chance for him those months were delightful noyes was constantly with me and the more i saw of him the better i liked him his stupidity was a natural grace it was as beautiful really as his eyelashes and he was so gay so affectionate and so happy with me that telling him the truth would have been about as pleasant as slitting the throat of some artless animal at first i used to wonder what had put into that radiant head the detestable delusion that it held a brain then i began to see that it was simply protective mimicry an instinctive ruse to get away from family life and an office desk not that gilbert didnt dear lad believe in himself there wasnt a trace of hypocrisy in his composition he was sure that his call was irresistible while to me it was the saving grace of his situation that it wasnt and that a little money a little leisure a little pleasure would have turned him into an inoffensive idler unluckily however there was no hope of money and with the grim alternative of the office desk before him he couldnt postpone his attempt at literature the stuff he turned out was deplorable and i see now that i knew it from the first still the absurdity of deciding a mans whole future on a first trial seemed to justify me in withholding my verdict and perhaps even in encouraging him a little on the ground that the human plant generally needs warmth to flower at any rate i proceeded on that principle and carried it to the point of getting his term of probation extended when i left rome he went with me and we idled away a delicious summer between capri and venice i said to myself if he has anything in him it will come out now and it did he was never more enchanting and enchanted there were moments of our pilgrimage when beauty born of murmuring sound seemed actually to pass into his face but only to issue forth in a shallow flood of the palest ink well the time came to turn off the tap and i knew there was no hand but mine to do it we were back in rome and i had taken him to stay with me not wanting him to be alone in his dismal pension when he had to face the necessity of renouncing his ambition i hadnt of course relied solely on my own judgment in deciding to advise him to drop literature i had sent his stuff to various people editors and critics and they had always sent it back with the same chilling lack of comment really there was nothing on earth to say about it i confess i never felt more shabbily than i did on the day when i decided to have it out with gilbert it was well enough to tell myself that it was my duty to knock the poor boys hopes into splinters but id like to know what act of gratuitous cruelty hasnt been justified on that plea ive always shrunk from usurping the functions of providence and when i have to exercise them i decidedly prefer that it shouldnt be on an errand of destruction besides in the last issue who was i to decide even after a years trial if poor gilbert had it in him or not the more i looked at the part id resolved to play the less i liked it and i liked it still less when gilbert sat opposite me with his head thrown back in the lamplight just as phils is now id been going over his last manuscript and he knew it and he knew that his future hung on my verdict wed tacitly agreed to that the manuscript lay between us on my table a novel his first novel if you please and he reached over and laid his hand on it and looked up at me with all his life in the look i stood up and cleared my throat trying to keep my eyes away from his face and on the manuscript the fact is my dear gilbert i began i saw him turn pale but he was up and facing me in an instant oh look here dont take on so my dear fellow im not so awfully cut up as all that his hands were on my shoulders and he was laughing down on me from his full height with a kind of mortallystricken gaiety that drove the knife into my side he was too beautifully brave for me to keep up any humbug about my duty and it came over me suddenly how i should hurt others in hurting him myself first since sending him home meant losing him but more particularly poor alice nowell to whom i had so uneasily longed to prove my good faith and my immense desire to serve her it really seemed like failing her twice to fail gilbert but my intuition was like one of those lightning flashes that encircle the whole horizon and in the same instant i saw what i might be letting myself in for if i didnt tell the truth i said to myself i shall have him for life and id never yet seen any one man or woman whom i was quite sure of wanting on those terms well this impulse of egotism decided me i was ashamed of it and to get away from it i took a leap that landed me straight in gilberts arms the things all right and youre all wrong i shouted up at him and as he hugged me and i laughed and shook in his incredulous clutch i had for a minute the sense of selfcomplacency that is supposed to attend the footsteps of the just hang it all making people happy has its charms gilbert of course was for celebrating his emancipation in some spectacular manner but i sent him away alone to explode his emotions and went to bed to sleep off mine as i undressed i began to wonder what their aftertaste would be so many of the finest dont keep still i wasnt sorry and i meant to empty the bottle even if it did turn a trifle flat after i got into bed i lay for a long time smiling at the memory of his eyes his blissful eyes then i fell asleep and when i woke the room was deathly cold and i sat up with a jerk and there were the other eyes it was three years since id seen them but id thought of them so often that i fancied they could never take me unawares again now with their red sneer on me i knew that i had never really believed they would come back and that i was as defenceless as ever against them as before it was the insane irrelevance of their coming that made it so horrible what the deuce were they after to leap out at me at such a time i had lived more or less carelessly in the years since id seen them though my worst indiscretions were not dark enough to invite the searchings of their infernal glare but at this particular moment i was really in what might have been called a state of grace and i cant tell you how the fact added to their horror but its not enough to say they were as bad as before they were worse worse by just so much as id learned of life in the interval by all the damnable implications my wider experience read into them i saw now what i hadnt seen before that they were eyes which had grown hideous gradually which had built up their baseness coralwise bit by bit out of a series of small turpitudes slowly accumulated through the industrious years yes it came to me that what made them so bad was that theyd grown bad so slowly there they hung in the darkness their swollen lids dropped across the little watery bulbs rolling loose in the orbits and the puff of fat flesh making a muddy shadow underneath and as their filmy stare moved with my movements there came over me a sense of their tacit complicity of a deep hidden understanding between us that was worse than the first shock of their strangeness not that i understood them but that they made it so clear that some day i should yes that was the worst part of it decidedly and it was the feeling that became stronger each time they came back to me for they got into the damnable habit of coming back they reminded me of vampires with a taste for young flesh they seemed so to gloat over the taste of a good conscience every night for a month they came to claim their morsel of mine since id made gilbert happy they simply wouldnt loosen their fangs the coincidence almost made me hate him poor lad fortuitous as i felt it to be i puzzled over it a good deal but couldnt find any hint of an explanation except in the chance of his association with alice nowell but then the eyes had let up on me the moment i had abandoned her so they could hardly be the emissaries of a woman scorned even if one could have pictured poor alice charging such spirits to avenge her that set me thinking and i began to wonder if they would let up on me if i abandoned gilbert the temptation was insidious and i had to stiffen myself against it but really dear boy he was too charming to be sacrificed to such demons and so after all i never found out what they wanted iii the fire crumbled sending up a flash which threw into relief the narrators gnarled red face under its greyblack stubble pressed into the hollow of the dark leather armchair it stood out an instant like an intaglio of yellowish redveined stone with spots of enamel for the eyes then the fire sank and in the shaded lamplight it became once more a dim rembrandtish blur phil frenham sitting in a low chair on the opposite side of the hearth one long arm propped on the table behind him one hand supporting his thrownback head and his eyes steadily fixed on his old friends face had not moved since the tale began he continued to maintain his silent immobility after culwin had ceased to speak and it was i who with a vague sense of disappointment at the sudden drop of the story finally asked but how long did you keep on seeing them culwin so sunk into his chair that he seemed like a heap of his own empty clothes stirred a little as if in surprise at my question he appeared to have halfforgotten what he had been telling us how long oh off and on all that winter it was infernal i never got used to them i grew really ill frenham shifted his attitude silently and as he did so his elbow struck against a small mirror in a bronze frame standing on the table behind him he turned and changed its angle slightly then he resumed his former attitude his dark head thrown back on his lifted palm his eyes intent on culwins face something in his stare embarrassed me and as if to divert attention from it i pressed on with another question and you never tried sacrificing noyes oh no the fact is i didnt have to he did it for me poor infatuated boy did it for you how do you mean he wore me out wore everybody out he kept on pouring out his lamentable twaddle and hawking it up and down the place till he became a thing of terror i tried to wean him from writing oh ever so gently you understand by throwing him with agreeable people giving him a chance to make himself felt to come to a sense of what he really had to give id foreseen this solution from the beginning felt sure that once the first ardour of authorship was quenched hed drop into his place as a charming parasitic thing the kind of chronic cherubino for whom in old societies theres always a seat at table and a shelter behind the ladies skirts i saw him take his place as the poet the poet who doesnt write one knows the type in every drawingroom living in that way doesnt cost much id worked it all out in my mind and felt sure that with a little help he could manage it for the next few years and meanwhile hed be sure to marry i saw him married to a widow rather older with a good cook and a wellrun house and i actually had my eye on the widow meanwhile i did everything to facilitate the transition lent him money to ease his conscience introduced him to pretty women to make him forget his vows but nothing would do him he had but one idea in his beautiful obstinate head he wanted the laurel and not the rose and he kept on repeating gautiers axiom and battering and filing at his limp prose till hed spread it out over lord knows how many thousand sloppy pages now and then he would send a pailful to a publisher and of course it would always come back at first it didnt matter he thought he was misunderstood he took the attitudes of genius and whenever an opus came home he wrote another to keep it company then he had a reaction of despair and accused me of deceiving him and lord knows what i got angry at that and told him it was he who had deceived himself hed come to me determined to write and id done my best to help him that was the extent of my offence and id done it for his cousins sake not his that seemed to strike home and he didnt answer for a minute then he said my times up and my moneys up what do you think id better do i think youd better not be an ass i said he turned red and asked what do you mean by being an ass i took a letter from my desk and held it out to him i mean refusing this offer of mrs ellingers to be her secretary at a salary of five thousand dollars there may be a lot more in it than that he flung out his hand with a violence that struck the letter from mine oh i know well enough whats in it he said scarlet to the roots of his hair and whats your answer if you know i asked he made none at the minute but turned away slowly to the door there with his hand on the threshold he stopped to ask almost under his breath then you really think my stuffs no good i was tired and exasperated and i laughed i dont defend my laugh it was in wretched taste but i must plead in extenuation that the boy was a fool and that id done my best for him i really had he went out of the room shutting the door quietly after him that afternoon i left for frascati where id promised to spend the sunday with some friends i was glad to escape from gilbert and by the same token as i learned that night i had also escaped from the eyes i dropped into the same lethargic sleep that had come to me before when their visitations ceased and when i woke the next morning in my peaceful painted room above the ilexes i felt the utter weariness and deep relief that always followed on that repairing slumber i put in two blessed nights at frascati and when i got back to my rooms in rome i found that gilbert had gone oh nothing tragic had happened the episode never rose to that hed simply packed his manuscripts and left for america for his family and the wall street desk he left a decent little note to tell me of his decision and behaved altogether in the circumstances as little like a fool as its possible for a fool to behave iv culwin paused again and again frenham sat motionless the dusky contour of his young head reflected in the mirror at his back and what became of noyes afterward i finally asked still disquieted by a sense of incompleteness by the need of some connecting thread between the parallel lines of the tale culwin twitched his shoulders oh nothing became of him because he became nothing there could be no question of becoming about it he vegetated in an office i believe and finally got a clerkship in a consulate and married drearily in china i saw him once in hong kong years afterward he was fat and hadnt shaved i was told he drank he didnt recognize me and the eyes i asked after another pause which frenhams continued silence made oppressive culwin stroking his chin blinked at me meditatively through the shadows i never saw them after my last talk with gilbert put two and two together if you can for my part i havent found the link he rose stiffly his hands in his pockets and walked over to the table on which reviving drinks had been set out you must be parched after this dry tale here help yourself my dear fellow here phil he turned back to the hearth frenham still sat in his low chair making no response to his hosts hospitable summons but as culwin advanced toward him their eyes met in a long look after which to my intense surprise the young man turning suddenly in his seat flung his arms across the table and dropped his face upon them culwin at the unexpected gesture stopped short a flush on his face phil what the deuce why have the eyes scared you my dear boy my dear fellow i never had such a tribute to my literary ability never he broke into a chuckle at the thought and halted on the hearthrug his hands still in his pockets gazing down in honest perplexity at the youths bowed head then as frenham still made no answer he moved a step or two nearer cheer up my dear phil its years since ive seen them apparently ive done nothing lately bad enough to call them out of chaos unless my present evocation of them has made you see them which would be their worst stroke yet his bantering appeal quivered off into an uneasy laugh and he moved still nearer bending over frenham and laying his gouty hands on the lads shoulders phil my dear boy really whats the matter why dont you answer have you seen the eyes frenhams face was still pressed against his arms and from where i stood behind culwin i saw the latter as if under the rebuff of this unaccountable attitude draw back slowly from his friend as he did so the light of the lamp on the table fell full on his perplexed congested face and i caught its sudden reflection in the mirror behind frenhams head culwin saw the reflection also he paused his face level with the mirror as if scarcely recognizing the countenance in it as his own but as he looked his expression gradually changed and for an appreciable space of time he and the image in the glass confronted each other with a glare of slowly gathering hate then culwin let go of frenhams shoulders and drew back a step covering his eyes with his hands frenham his face still hidden did not stir the blond beast i it had been almost too easy that was young millners first feeling as he stood again on the spence doorstep the great moment of his interview behind him and fifth avenue rolling its grimy pactolus at his feet halting there in the winter light with the clang of the ponderous vestibule doors in his ears and his eyes carried down the perspective of the packed interminable thoroughfare he even dared to remember rastignacs apostrophe to paris and to hazard recklessly under his small fair moustache who knows he hugh millner at any rate knew a good deal already a good deal more than he had imagined it possible to learn in half an hours talk with a man like orlando g spence and the loudrumouring city spread out there before him seemed to grin like an accomplice who knew the rest a gust of wind whirling down from the dizzy height of the building on the next corner drove sharply through his overcoat and compelled him to clutch at his hat it was a bitter january day a day of fierce light and air when the sunshine cut like icicles and the wind sucked one into black gulfs at the street corners but millners complacency was like a warm lining to his shabby coat and heaving steadied his hat he continued to stand on the spence threshold lost in the vision revealed to him from the pisgah of its marble steps yes it was wonderful what the vision showed him in his absorption he might have frozen fast to the doorstep if the rhadamanthine portals behind him had not suddenly opened to let out a slim furcoated figure the figure as he perceived of the youth whom he had caught in the act of withdrawal as he entered mr spences study and whom the latter with a wave of his affable hand had detained to introduce as my son draper it was characteristic of the odd friendliness of the whole scene that the great man should have thought it worth while to call back and name his heir to a mere humble applicant like millner and that the heir should shed on him from a pale highbrowed face a smile of such deprecating kindness it was characteristic equally of millner that he should at once mark the narrowness of the shoulders sustaining this ingenuous head a narrowness as he now observed imperfectly concealed by the wide fur collar of young spences expensive and badly cut coat but the face took on as the youth smiled his surprise at their second meeting a look of almost plaintive goodwill the kind of look that millner scorned and yet could never quite resist mr millner are you er waiting the lad asked with an intention of serviceableness that was like a finer echo of his fathers resounding cordiality for my motor no millner jested in his frank free voice the fact is i was just standing here lost in the contemplation of my luck and as his companions pale blue eyes seemed to shape a question my extraordinary luck he explained in having been engaged as your fathers secretary oh the other rejoined with a faint colour in his sallow cheek im so glad he murmured but i was sure he stopped and the two looked kindly at each other millner averted his gaze first almost fearful of its betraying the added sense of his own strength and dexterity which he drew from the contrast of the others frailness sure how could any one be sure i dont believe in it yet he laughed out in the irony of his triumph the boys words did not sound like a mere civility millner felt in them an homage to his power oh yes i was sure young draper repeated sure as soon as i saw you i mean millner tingled again with this tribute to his physical straightness and bloom yes he looked his part hang it he looked it but his companion still lingered a shy sociability in his eye if youre walking then can i go along a little way and he nodded southward down the shabby gaudy avenue that again was part of the high comedy of the hour that millner should descend the spence steps at young spences side and stroll down fifth avenue with him at the proudest moment of the afternoon o g spences secretary walking abroad with o g spences heir he had the scientific detachment to pull out his watch and furtively note the hour yes it was exactly forty minutes since he had rung the spence doorbell and handed his card to a gelid footman who openly sceptical of his claim to be received had left him unceremoniously planted on the cold tessellations of the vestibule some day miller grinned to himself i think ill take that footman as furnaceman or to do the boots and he pictured his marble palace rising from the earth to form the mausoleum of a footmans pride only forty minutes ago and now he had his opportunity fast and he never meant to let it go it was incredible what had happened in the interval he had gone up the spence steps an unknown young man out of a job and with no substantial hope of getting into one a needy young man with a mother and two limp sisters to be helped and a lengthening figure of debt that stood by his bed through the anxious nights and he went down the steps with his present assured and his future lit by the hues of the rainbow above the pot of gold certainly a fellow who made his way at that rate had it in him and could afford to trust his star descending from this joyous flight he stooped his ear to the discourse of young spence my fatherll work you rather hard you know but you look as if you wouldnt mind that millner pulled up his inches with the selfconsciousness of the man who had none to waste oh no i shant mind that i dont mind any amount of work if it leads to something just so draper spence assented eagerly thats what i feel and youll find that whatever my father undertakes leads to such awfully fine things millner tightened his lips on a grin he was thinking only of where the work would lead him not in the least of where it might land the eminent orlando g spence but he looked at his companion sympathetically youre a philanthropist like your father i see oh i dont know they had paused at a crossing and young draper with a dubious air stood striking his agateheaded stick against the curbstone i believe in a purpose dont you he asked lifting his blue eyes suddenly to millners face a purpose i should rather say so i believe in nothing else cried millner feeling as if his were something he could grip in his hand and swing like a club young spence seemed relieved yes i tie up to that there is a purpose and so after all even if i dont agree with my father on minor points he coloured quickly and looked again at millner i should like to talk to you about this some day millner smothered another smile well have lots of talks i hope oh if you can spare the time said draper almost humbly why i shall be there on tap for father not me draper hesitated with another selfconfessing smile father thinks i talk too much that i keep going in and out of things he doesnt believe in analyzing he thinks its destructive but it hasnt destroyed my ideals he looked wistfully up and down the clanging street and thats the main thing isnt it i mean that one should have an ideal he turned back almost gaily to millner i suspect youre a revolutionist too revolutionist rather i belong to the red syndicate and the black hand millner joyfully assented young draper chuckled at the enormity of the joke first rate well have incendiary meetings he pulled an elaborately armorial watch from his enfolding furs im so sorry but i must say goodbye this is my street he explained millner with a faint twinge of envy glanced across at the colonnaded marble edifice in the farther corner going to the club he said carelessly his companion looked surprised oh no i never go there its too boring and he brought out after one of the pauses in which he seemed rather breathlessly to measure the chances of his listeners indulgence im just going over to a little bible class i have in tenth avenue millner for a moment or two stood watching the slim figure wind its way through the mass of vehicles to the opposite corner then he pursued his own course down fifth avenue measuring his steps to the rhythmic refrain its too easy its too easy its too easy his own destination being the small shabby flat off university place where three tender females awaited the result of his mission he had time on the way home after abandoning himself to a general sense of triumph to dwell specifically on the various aspects of his achievement viewed materially and practically it was a thing to be proud of yet it was chiefly on aesthetic grounds because he had done so exactly what he had set out to do that he glowed with pride at the afternoons work for after all any young man with the proper pull might have applied to orlando g spence for the post of secretary and even have penetrated as far as the great mans study but that he hugh millner should not only have forced his way to this fastness but have established within a short half hour his right to remain there permanently well this if it proved anything proved that the first rule of success was to know how to live up to ones principles one must have a plan one must have a plan the young man murmured looking with pity at the vague faces which the crowd bore past him and feeling almost impelled to detain them and expound his doctrine but the planlessness of average human nature was of course the measure of his opportunity and he smiled to think that every purposeless face he met was a guarantee of his own advancement a rung in the ladder he meant to climb yes the whole secret of success was to know what one wanted to do and not to be afraid to do it his own history was proving that already he had not been afraid to give up his small but safe position in a realestate office for the precarious adventure of a private secretaryship and his first glimpse of his new employer had convinced him that he had not mistaken his calling when one has a way with one as in all modesty millner knew he had not to utilize it is a stupid waste of force and when he had learned that orlando g spence was in search of a private secretary who should be able to give him intelligent assistance in the execution of his philanthropic schemes the young man felt that his hour had come it was no part of his plan to associate himself with one of the masters of finance he had a notion that minnows who go to a whale to learn how to grow bigger are likely to be swallowed in the process the opportunity of a clever young man with a cool head and no prejudices this again was drawn from life lay rather in making himself indispensable to one of the beneficent rich and in using the timidities and conformities of his patron as the means of his scruples about formulating these principles to himself it was not for nothing that in his college days he had hunted the hypothetical moral sense to its lair and dragged from their concealment the various selfadvancing sentiments dissembled under its edifying guise his strength lay in his precocious insight into the springs of action and in his refusal to classify them according to the accepted moral and social sanctions he had to the full the courage of his lack of convictions to a young man so untrammelled by prejudice it was selfevident that helpless philanthropists like orlando g spence were just as much the natural diet of the strong as the lamb is of the wolf it was pleasanter to eat than to be eaten in a world where as yet there seemed to be no third alternative and any scruples one might feel as to the temporary discomfort of ones victim were speedily dispelled by that larger scientific view which took into account the social destructiveness of the benevolent millner was persuaded that every individual woe mitigated by the philanthropy of orlando g spence added just so much to the sumtotal of human inefficiency and it was one of his favourite subjects of speculation to picture the innumerable social evils that may follow upon the rescue of one infant from mount taygetus were all born to prey on each other and pity for suffering is one of the most elementary stages of egotism until one has passed beyond and acquired a taste for the more complex forms of the instinct he stopped suddenly checked in his advance by a sallow wisp of a dog which had plunged through the press of vehicles to hurl itself between his legs millner did not dislike animals though he preferred that they should be healthy and handsome the dog under his feet was neither its cringing contour showed an injudicious mingling of races and its meagre coat betrayed the deplorable habit of sleeping in coalholes and subsisting on an innutritious diet in addition to these physical disadvantages its shrinking and inconsequent movements revealed a congenital weakness of character which even under more favourable conditions would hardly have qualified it to become a useful member of society and millner was not sorry to notice that it moved with a limp of the hind leg that probably doomed it to speedy extinction the absurdity of such an animals attempting to cross fifth avenue at the most crowded hour of the afternoon struck him as only less great than the irony of its having been permitted to achieve the feat and he stood a moment looking at it and wondering what had moved it to the attempt it was really a perfect type of the human derelict which orlando g spence and his kind were devoting their millions to perpetuate and he reflected how much better nature knew her business in dealing with the superfluous quadruped an elderly lady advancing in the opposite direction evidently took a less dispassionate view of the case for she paused to remark emotionally oh you poor thing while she stooped to caress the object of her sympathy the dog with characteristic lack of discrimination viewed her gesture with suspicion and met it with a snarl the lady turned pale and shrank away a chivalrous male repelled the animal with his umbrella and two idle boys backed his action by a vigorous hi the object of these hostile demonstrations apparently attributing them not to its own unsocial conduct but merely to the chronic animosity of the universe dashed wildly around the corner into a side street and as it did so millner noticed that the lame leg left a little trail of blood irresistibly he turned the corner to see what would happen next it was deplorably clear that the animal itself had no plan but after several inconsequent and contradictory movements it plunged down an area where it backed up against the iron gate forlornly and foolishly at bay millner still following looked down at it and wondered then he whistled just to see if it would come but this only caused it to start up on its quivering legs with desperate turns of the head that measured the chances of escape oh hang it you poor devil stay there if you like the young man murmured walking away a few yards off he looked back and saw that the dog had made a rush out of the area and was limping furtively down the street the idle boys were in the offing and he disliked the thought of leaving them in control of the situation softly with infinite precautions he began to follow the dog he did not know why he was doing it but the impulse was overmastering for a moment he seemed to be gaining upon his quarry but with a cunning sense of his approach it suddenly turned and hobbled across the frozen grassplot adjoining a shuttered house against the wall at the back of the plot it cowered down in a dirty snowdrift as if disheartened by the struggle millner stood outside the railings and looked at it he reflected that under the shelter of the winter dusk it might have the luck to remain there unmolested and that in the morning it would probably be dead of cold this was so obviously the best solution that he began to move away again but as he did so the idle boys confronted him ketch yer dog for yer boss they grinned millner consigned them to the devil and stood sternly watching them till the first stage of the journey had carried them around the nearest corner then after pausing to look once more up and down the empty street laid his hand on the railing and vaulted over it into the grassplot as he did so he reflected that since pity for suffering was one of the most elementary forms of egotism he ought to have remembered that it was necessarily one of the most tenacious ii my chief aim in life orlando g spence repeated he threw himself back in his chair straightened the tortoiseshell pincenez on his short blunt nose and beamed down the luncheon table at the two young men who shared his repast his glance rested on his son draper seated opposite him behind a barrier of georgian silver and orchids but his words were addressed to his secretary who stylograph in hand had turned from the seductions of a mushroom souffle in order to jot down for the sunday investigator an outline of his employers views and intentions respecting the newly endowed orlando g spence college for missionaries it was mr spences practice to receive in person the journalists privileged to impart his opinions to a waiting world but during the last few months and especially since the vast project of the missionary college had been in process of development the pressure of business and beneficence had necessitated millners frequent intervention and compelled the secretary to snatch the sense of his patrons elucubrations between the courses of their hasty meals young millner had a healthy appetite and it was not one of his least sacrifices to be so often obliged to curb it in the interest of his advancement but whenever he waved aside one of the triumphs of mr spences chef he was conscious of rising a step in his employers favour mr spence did not despise the pleasures of the table though he appeared to regard them as the reward of success rather than as the alleviation of effort and it increased his sense of his secretarys merit to note how keenly the young man enjoyed the fare which he was so frequently obliged to deny himself draper having subsisted since infancy on a diet of truffles and terrapin consumed such delicacies with the insensibility of a traveller swallowing a railway sandwich but millner never made the mistake of concealing from mr spence his sense of what he was losing when duty constrained him to exchange the fork for the pen my chief aim in life mr spence repeated removing his eyeglass and swinging it thoughtfully on his finger im sorry you should miss this souffle millner its worth while why i suppose i might say that my chief aim in life is to leave the world better than i found it yes i dont know that i could put it better than that to leave the world better than i found it it wouldnt be a bad idea to use that as a headline wants to leave the world better than he found it its exactly the point i should like to make in this talk about the college mr spence paused and his glance once more reverted to his son who having pushed aside his plate sat watching millner with a dreamy intensity and its the point i want to make with you too draper his father continued genially while he turned over with a critical fork the plump and perfectly matched asparagus which a footman was presenting to his notice i want to make you feel that nothing else counts in comparison with that no amount of literary success or intellectual celebrity oh i do feel that draper murmured with one of his quick blushes and a glance that wavered between his father and millner the secretary kept his eyes on his notes and young spence continued after a pause only the thing is isnt it to try and find out just what does make the world better to try to find out his father echoed compassionately its not necessary to try very hard goodness is what makes the world better yes yes of course his son nervously interposed but the question is what is good mr spence with a darkening brow brought his fist down emphatically on the damask ill thank you not to blaspheme my son drapers head reared itself a trifle higher on his thin neck i was not going to blaspheme only there may be different ways theres where youre mistaken draper theres only one way theres my way said mr spence in a tone of unshaken conviction i know father i see what you mean but dont you see that even your way wouldnt be the right way for you if you ceased to believe that it was his father looked at him with mingled bewilderment and reprobation do you mean to say that the fact of goodness depends on my conception of it and not on god almightys i do yes in a specific sense young draper falteringly maintained and mr spence turned with a discouraged gesture toward his secretarys suspended pen i dont understand your scientific jargon draper and i dont want to whats the next point millner no no savarin bring the fruit and the coffee with it millner keenly aware that an aromatic savarin au rhum was describing an arc behind his head previous to being rushed back to the pantry under young drapers indifferent eye stiffened himself against this last assault of the enemy and read out firmly what relation do you consider that a mans business conduct should bear to his religious and domestic life mr spence mused a moment why thats a stupid question it goes over the same ground as the other one a man ought to do good with his money thats all go on at this point the butlers murmur in his ear caused him to push back his chair and to arrest millners interrogatory by a rapid gesture yes im coming hold the wire mr spence rose and plunged into the adjoining office where a telephone and a remington divided the attention of a young lady in spectacles who was preparing for zenana work in the east as the door closed the butler having placed the coffee and liqueurs on the table withdrew in the rear of his battalion and the two young men were left alone beneath the rembrandts and hobbemas on the diningroom walls there was a moments silence between them then young spence leaning across the table said in the lowered tone of intimacy why do you suppose he dodged that last question millner who had rapidly taken an opulent purple fig from the fruitdish nearest him paused in surprise in the act of hurrying it to his lips i mean draper hastened on the question as to the relation between business and private morality its such an interesting one and hes just the person who ought to tackle it millner despatching the fig glanced down at his notes i dont think your father meant to dodge the question young draper continued to look at him intently you think he imagined that his answer really covers the ground as much as it needs to be covered the son of the house glanced away with a sigh you know things about him that i dont he said wistfully but without a tinge of resentment in his tone oh as to that may i give myself some coffee millner in his walk around the table to fill his cup paused a moment to lay an affectionate hand on drapers shoulder perhaps i know him better in a sense outsiders often get a more accurate focus draper considered this and your idea is that he acts on principles he has never thought of testing or defining millner looked up quickly and for an instant their glances crossed how do you mean i mean that hes an inconscient instrument of goodness as it were a a sort of blindly beneficent force the other smiled thats not a bad definition i know one thing about him at any rate hes awfully upset at your having chucked your bible class a shadow fell on young spences candid brow i know but what can i do about it thats what i was thinking of when i tried to show him that goodness in a certain sense is purely subjective that one cant do good against ones principles again his glance appealed to millner you understand me dont you millner stirred his coffee in a silence not unclouded by perplexity theoretically perhaps its a pretty question certainly but i also understand your fathers feeling that it hasnt much to do with real life especially now that hes got to make a speech in connection with the founding of this missionary college he may think that any hint of internecine strife will weaken his prestige mightnt you have waited a little longer how could i when i might have been expected to take a part in this performance to talk and say things i didnt mean that was exactly what made me decide not to wait the door opened and mr spence reentered the room as he did so his son rose abruptly as if to leave it where are you off to draper the banker asked im in rather a hurry sir mr spence looked at his watch you cant be in more of a hurry than i am and ive got seven minutes and a half he seated himself behind the coffee tray lit a cigar laid his watch on the table and signed to draper to resume his place no millner dont you go i want you both he turned to the secretary you know that drapers given up his bible class i understand its not from the pressure of engagements mr spences narrow lips took an ironic curve under the straightclipped stubble of his moustache its on principle he tells me hes principled against doing good draper lifted a protesting hand its not exactly that father i know youll tell me its some scientific quibble that i dont understand ive never had time to go in for intellectual hairsplitting ive found too many people down in the mire who needed a hand to pull them out a busy man has to take his choice between helping his fellowmen and theorizing about them ive preferred to help you might take that down for the investigator millner and i thank god ive never stopped to ask what made me want to do good ive just yielded to the impulse thats all mr spence turned back to his son better men than either of us have been satisfied with that creed my son draper was silent and mr spence once more addressed himself to his secretary millner youre a reader ive caught you at it and i know this boy talks to you what have you got to say do you suppose a bible class ever hurt anybody millner paused a moment feeling all through his nervous system the fateful tremor of the balance thats what i was just trying to tell him sir ah you were thats good then ill only say one thing more your doing what youve done at this particular moment hurts me more draper than your teaching the gospel of jesus could possibly have hurt those young men over in tenth avenue mr spence arose and restored his watch to his pocket i shall want you in twenty minutes millner the door closed on him and for a while the two young men sat silent behind their cigar fumes then draper spence broke out with a catch in his throat thats what i cant bear millner what i simply cant bear to hurt him to hurt his faith in me its an awful responsibility isnt it to tamper with anybodys faith in anything iii the twenty minutes prolonged themselves to forty the forty to fifty and the fifty to an hour and still millner waited for mr spences summons during the two years of his secretaryship the young man had learned the significance of such postponements mr spences days were organized like a railway timetable and a delay of an hour implied a casualty as farreaching as the breaking down of an express of the cause of the present derangement hugh millner was ignorant and the experience of the last months allowed him to fluctuate between conflicting conjectures all were based on the indisputable fact that mr spence was bothered had for some time past been bothered and it was one of millners discoveries that an extremely parsimonious use of the emotions underlay mr spences expansive manner and fraternal phraseology and that he did not throw away his feelings any more than for all his philanthropy he threw away his money if he was bothered then it could be only because a careful survey of his situation had forced on him some unpleasant fact with which he was not immediately prepared to deal and any unpreparedness on mr spences part was also a significant symptom obviously millners original conception of his employers character had suffered extensive modification but no final outline had replaced the first conjectural image the two years spent in mr spences service had produced too many contradictory impressions to be fitted into any definite pattern and the chief lesson millner had learned from them was that life was less of an exact science and character a more incalculable element than he had been taught in the schools in the light of this revised impression his own footing seemed less secure than he had imagined and the rungs of the ladder he was climbing more slippery than they had looked from below he was not without the reassuring sense of having made himself in certain small ways necessary to mr spence and this conviction was confirmed by drapers reiterated assurance of his fathers appreciation but millner had begun to suspect that one might be necessary to mr spence one day and a superfluity if not an obstacle the next and that it would take superhuman astuteness to foresee how and when the change would occur every fluctuation of the great mans mood was therefore anxiously noted by the young meteorologist in his service and this observers vigilance was now strained to the utmost by the little cloud no bigger than a mans hand adumbrated by the bankers unpunctuality when mr spence finally appeared his aspect did not tend to dissipate the cloud he wore what millner had learned to call his backdoor face a blank barred countenance in which only an occasional twitch of the lids behind his glasses suggested that some one was on the watch in this mood mr spence usually seemed unconscious of his secretarys presence or aware of it only as an arm terminating in a pen millner accustomed on such occasions to exist merely as a function sat waiting for the click of the spring that should set him in action but the pressure not being applied he finally hazarded are we to go on with the investigator sir mr spence who had been pacing up and down between the desk and the fireplace threw himself into his usual seat at millners elbow i dont understand this new notion of drapers he said abruptly wheres he got it from no one ever learned irreligion in my household he turned his eyes on millner who had the sense of being scrutinized through a groundglass window which left him visible while it concealed his observer the young man let his pen describe two or three vague patterns on the blank sheet before him draper has ideas he risked at last mr spence looked hard at him thats all right he said i want my son to have everything but whats the point of mixing up ideas and principles ive seen fellows who did that and they were generally trying to borrow five dollars to get away from the sheriff whats all this talk about goodness goodness isnt an idea its a fact its as solid as a business proposition and its drapers duty as the son of a wealthy man and the prospective steward of a great fortune to elevate the standards of other young men of young men who havent had his opportunities the rich ought to preach contentment and to set the example themselves we have our cares but we ought to conceal them we ought to be cheerful and accept things as they are not go about sowing dissent and restlessness what has draper got to give these boys in his bible class thats so much better than what he wants to take from them thats the question id like to have answered mr spence carried away by his own eloquence had removed his pincenez and was twirling it about his extended forefinger with the gesture habitual to him when he spoke in public after a pause he went on with a drop to the level of private intercourse i tell you this because i know you have a good deal of influence with draper he has a high opinion of your brains but youre a practical fellow and you must see what i mean try to make draper see it make him understand how it looks to have him drop his bible class just at this particular time it was his own choice to take up religious teaching among young men he began with our officeboys and then the work spread and was blessed i was almost alarmed at one time at the way it took hold of him when the papers began to talk about him as a formative influence i was afraid hed lose his head and go into the church luckily he tried university settlement first but just as i thought he was settling down to that he took to worrying about the higher criticism and saying he couldnt go on teaching fairytales as history i cant see that any good ever came of criticizing what our parents believed and its a queer time for draper to criticize my belief just as im backing it to the extent of five millions millner remained silent and as though his silence were an argument mr spence continued combatively drapers always talking about some distinction between religion and morality i dont understand what he means i got my morals out of the bible and i guess theres enough left in it for draper if religion wont make a man moral i dont see why irreligion should and he talks about using his mind well cant he use that in wall street a man can get a good deal farther in life watching the market than picking holes in genesis and he can do more good too theres a time for everything and draper seems to me to have mixed up weekdays with sunday mr spence replaced his eyeglasses and stretching his hand to the silver box at his elbow extracted from it one of the long cigars sheathed in goldleaf which were reserved for his private consumption the secretary hastened to tender him a match and for a moment he puffed in silence when he spoke again it was in a different note ive got about all the bother i can handle just now without this nonsense of drapers that was one of the trustees of the college with me it seems the flashlight has been trying to stir up a fuss mr spence paused and turned his pincenez on his secretary you havent heard from them he asked from the flashlight no millners surprise was genuine he detected a gleam of relief behind mr spences glasses it may be just malicious talk thats the worst of good works they bring out all the meanness in human nature and then there are always women mixed up in them and there never was a woman yet who understood the difference between philanthropy and business he drew again at his cigar and then with an unwonted movement leaned forward and mechanically pushed the box toward millner help yourself he said millner as mechanically took one of the virginally cinctured cigars and began to undo its wrappings it was the first time he had ever been privileged to detach that golden girdle and nothing could have given him a better measure of the importance of the situation and of the degree to which he was apparently involved in it you remember that san pablo rubber business thats what theyve been raking up said mr spence abruptly millner paused in the act of striking a match then with an appreciable effort of the will he completed the gesture applied the flame to his cigar and took a long inhalation the cigar was certainly delicious mr spence drawing a little closer leaned forward and touched him on the arm the touch caused millner to turn his head and for an instant the glance of the two men crossed at short range millner was conscious first of a nearer view than he had ever had of his employers face and of its vaguely suggesting a seamed sandstone head the kind of thing that lies in a corner in the court of a museum and in which only the round enamelled eyes have resisted the wear of time his next feeling was that he had now reached the moment to which the offer of the cigar had been a prelude he had always known that sooner or later such a moment would come all his life in a sense had been a preparation for it but in entering mr spences service he had not foreseen that it would present itself in this form he had seen himself consciously guiding that gentleman up to the moment rather than being thrust into it by a stronger hand and his first act of reflection was the resolve that in the end his hand should prove the stronger of the two this was followed almost immediately by the idea that to be stronger than mr spences it would have to be very strong indeed it was odd that he should feel this since as far as verbal communication went it was mr spence who was asking for his support in a theoretical statement of the case the banker would have figured as being at millners mercy but one of the queerest things about experience was the way it made light of theory millner felt now as though he were being crushed by some inexorable engine of which he had been playing with the lever he had always been intensely interested in observing his own reactions and had regarded this faculty of selfdetachment as of immense advantage in such a career as he had planned he felt this still even in the act of noting his own bewilderment felt it the more in contrast to the odd unconsciousness of mr spences attitude of the incredible candour of his selfabasement and selfabandonment it was clear that mr spence was not troubled by the repercussion of his actions in the consciousness of others and this looked like a weakness unless it were instead a great strength through the hum of these swarming thoughts mr spences voice was going on thats the only rag of proof theyve got and they got it by one of those nasty accidents that nobody can guard against i dont care how conscientiously a man attends to business he cant always protect himself against meddlesome people i dont pretend to know how the letter came into their hands but theyve got it and they mean to use it and they mean to say that you wrote it for me and that you knew what it was about when you wrote it theyll probably be after you tomorrow mr spence restoring his cigar to his lips puffed at it slowly in the pause that followed there was an instant during which the universe seemed to hugh millner like a soundingboard bent above his single consciousness if he spoke what thunders would be sent back to him from that intently listening vastness you see said mr spence the universal ear bent closer as if to catch the least articulation of millners narrowed lips but when he opened them it was merely to reinsert his cigar and for a short space nothing passed between the two men but an exchange of smokerings what do you mean to do theres the point mr spence at length sent through the rings oh yes the point was there as distinctly before millner as the tip of his expensive cigar he had seen it coming quite as soon as mr spence he knew that fate was handing him an ultimatum but the sense of the formidable echo which his least answer would rouse kept him doggedly and almost helplessly silent to let mr spence talk on as long as possible was no doubt the best way of gaining time but millner knew that his silence was really due to his dread of the echo suddenly however in a reaction of impatience at his own indecision he began to speak the sound of his voice cleared his mind and strengthened his resolve it was odd how the word seemed to shape the act though one knew how ancillary it really was as he talked it was as if the globe had swung around and he himself were upright on its axis with mr spence underneath on his head through the ensuing interchange of concise and rapid speech there sounded in millners ears the refrain to which he had walked down fifth avenue after his first talk with mr spence its too easy its too easy its too easy yes it was even easier than he had expected his sensation was that of the skilful carver who feels his good blade sink into a tender joint as he went on talking this surprised sense of mastery was like wine in his veins mr spence was at his mercy after all that was what it came to but this new view of the case did not lessen millners sense of mr spences strength it merely revealed to him his own superiority mr spence was even stronger than he had suspected there could be no better proof of that than his faith in millners power to grasp the situation and his tacit recognition of the young mans right to make the most of it millner felt that mr spence would have despised him even more for not using his advantage than for not seeing it and this homage to his capacity nerved him to greater alertness and made the concluding moments of their talk as physically exhilarating as some hotly contested game when the conclusion was reached and millner stood at the goal the golden trophy in his grasp his first conscious thought was one of regret that the struggle was over he would have liked to prolong their talk for the purely aesthetic pleasure of making mr spence lose time and better still of making him forget that he was losing it the sense of advantage that the situation conferred was so great that when mr spence rose it was as if millner were dismissing him and when he reached his hand toward the cigarbox it seemed to be one of millners cigars that he was taking iv there had been only one condition attached to the transaction millner was to speak to draper about the bible class the condition was easy to fulfil millner was confident of his power to deflect his young friends purpose and he knew the opportunity would be given him before the day was over his professional duties despatched he had only to go up to his room to wait draper nearly always looked in on him for a moment before dinner it was the hour most propitious to their elliptic interchange of words and silences meanwhile the waiting was an occupation in itself millner looked about his room with new eyes since the first thrill of initiation into its complicated comforts the showerbath the telephone the manyjointed readinglamp and the vast mirrored presses through which he was always hunting his scant outfit millners room had interested him no more than a railwaycarriage in which he might have been travelling but now it had acquired a sort of historic significance as the witness of the astounding change in his fate it was corsica it was brienne it was the kind of spot that posterity might yet mark with a tablet then he reflected that he should soon be leaving it and the lustre of its monumental mahogany was veiled in pathos why indeed should he linger on in bondage he perceived with a certain surprise that the only thing he should regret would be leaving draper it was odd it was inconsequent it was almost exasperating that such a regret should obscure his triumph why in the world should he suddenly take to regretting draper if there were any logic in human likings it should be to mr spence that he inclined draper dear lad had the illusion of an intellectual sympathy between them but that millner knew was an affair of reading and not of character drapers temerities would always be of that kind whereas his own well his own put to the proof had now definitely classed him with mr spence rather than with mr spences son it was a consequence of this new condition of his having thus distinctly and irrevocably classed himself that when draper at length brought upon the scene his shy shamble and his wistful smile millner for the first time had to steel himself against them instead of yielding to their charm in the new order upon which he had entered one principle of the old survived the point of honour between allies and millner had promised mr spence to speak to draper about his bible class draper thrown back in his chair and swinging a loose leg across a meagre knee listened with his habitual gravity his downcast eyes seemed to pursue the vision which millners words evoked and the words to their speaker took on a new sound as that candid consciousness refracted them you know dear boy i perfectly see your fathers point its naturally distressing to him at this particular time to have any hint of civil war leak out draper sat upright laying his lank legs knee to knee thats it then i thought that was it millner raised a surprised glance whats it that it should be at this particular time why naturally as i say just as hes making as it were his public profession of faith you know to men like your father convictions are irreducible elements they cant be split up and differently combined and your exegetical scruples seem to him to strike at the very root of his convictions draper pulled himself to his feet and shuffled across the room then he turned about and stood before his friend is it that or is it this he said and with the word he drew a letter from his pocket and proffered it silently to millner the latter as he unfolded it was first aware of an intense surprise at the young mans abruptness of tone and gesture usually draper fluttered long about his point before making it and his sudden movement seemed as mechanical as the impulsion conveyed by some strong spring the spring of course was in the letter and to it millner turned his startled glance feeling the while that by some curious cleavage of perception he was continuing to watch draper while he read oh the beasts he cried he and draper were face to face across the sheet which had dropped between them the youths features were tightened by a smile that was like the ligature of a wound he looked white and withered ah you knew then millner sat still and after a moment draper turned from him walked to the hearth and leaned against the chimney propping his chin on his hands millner his head thrown back stared up at the ceiling which had suddenly become to him the image of the universal soundingboard hanging over his consciousness you knew then draper repeated millner remained silent he had perceived with the surprise of a mathematician working out a new problem that the lie which mr spence had just bought of him was exactly the one gift he could give of his own free will to mr spences son this discovery gave the world a strange new topsyturvyness and set millners theories spinning about his brain like the cabin furniture of a tossing ship you knew said draper in a tone of quiet affirmation millner righted himself and grasped the arms of his chair as if that too were reeling about this blackguardly charge draper was studying him intently what does it matter if its blackguardly matter millner stammered its that of course in any case but the point is whether its true or not draper bent down and picking up the crumpled letter smoothed it out between his fingers the point is whether my father when he was publicly denouncing the peonage abuses on the san pablo plantations over a year ago had actually sold out his stock as he announced at the time or whether as they say here how do they put it he had simply transferred it to a dummy till the scandal should blow over and has meanwhile gone on drawing his forty per cent interest on five thousand shares theres the point millner had never before heard his young friend put a case with such unadorned precision his language was like that of mr spence making a statement to a committee meeting and the resemblance to his father flashed out with ironic incongruity you see why ive brought this letter to you i couldnt go to him with it drapers voice faltered and the resemblance vanished as suddenly as it had appeared no you couldnt go to him with it said millner slowly and since they say here that you know that theyve got your letter proving it the muscles of drapers face quivered as if a blinding light had been swept over it for gods sake millner its all right its all right said millner rising to his feet draper caught him by the wrist youre sure youre absolutely sure sure they know theyve got nothing to go on draper fell back a step and looked almost sternly at his friend you know thats not what i mean i dont care a straw what they think theyve got to go on i want to know if my fathers all right if he is they can say what they please millner again felt himself under the concentrated scrutiny of the ceiling of course of course i understand you understand then why dont you answer millner looked compassionately at the boys struggling face decidedly the battle was to the strong and he was not sorry to be on the side of the legions but drapers pain was as awkward as a material obstacle as something that one stumbled over in a race you know what im driving at millner again mr spences committeemeeting tone sounded oddly through his sons strained voice if my fathers so awfully upset about my giving up my bible class and letting it be known that i do so on conscientious grounds is it because hes afraid it may be considered a criticism on something he has done which which wont bear the test of the doctrines he believes in draper with the last question squared himself in front of millner as if suspecting that the latter meant to evade it by flight but millner had never felt more disposed to stand his ground than at that moment no by jove no its not that his relief almost escaped him in a cry as he lifted his head to give back drapers look on your honour the other passionately pressed him oh on anybodys you like on yours millner could hardly restrain a laugh of relief it was vertiginous to find himself spared after all the need of an altruistic lie he perceived that they were the kind he least liked draper took a deep breath you dont millner a lot depends on this you dont really think my father has any ulterior motive i think he has none but his horror of seeing you go straight to perdition they looked at each other again and drapers tension was suddenly relieved by a free boyish laugh its his convictions its just his funny old convictions its that and nothing else on earth draper turned back to the armchair he had left and let his narrow figure sink down into it as into a bath then he looked over at millner with a smile i can see that ive been worrying him horribly so he really thinks im on the road to perdition of course you can fancy what a sick minute i had when i thought it might be this other reason the damnable insinuation in this letter draper crumpled the paper in his hand and leaned forward to toss it into the coals of the grate i ought to have known better of course i ought to have remembered that as you say my father cant conceive how conduct may be independent of creed thats where i was stupid and rather base but that letter made me dizzy i couldnt think even now i cant very clearly im not sure what my convictions require of me they seem to me so much less to be considered than his when ive done half the good to people that he has it will be time enough to begin attacking their beliefs meanwhile meanwhile i cant touch his draper leaned forward stretching his lank arms along his knees his face was as clear as a spring sky i wont touch them millner go and tell him so v in the study a half hour later mr spence watch in hand was doling out his minutes again the peril conjured he had recovered his dominion over time he turned his commanding eyeglasses on millner its all settled then tell draper im sorry not to see him again tonight but im to speak at the dinner of the legal relief association and im due there in five minutes you and he dine alone here i suppose tell him i appreciate what hes done some day hell see that to leave the world better than we find it is the best we can hope to do youve finished the notes for the investigator be sure you dont forget that phrase well good evening thats all i think smooth and compact in his glossy evening clothes mr spence advanced toward the study door but as he reached it his secretary stood there before him its not quite all mr spence mr spence turned on him a look in which impatience was faintly tinged with apprehension what else is there its two and a half minutes to eight millner stood his ground it wont take longer than that i want to tell you that if you can conveniently replace me id like there are reasons why i shall have to leave you millner was conscious of reddening as he spoke his redness deepened under mr spences dispassionate scrutiny he saw at once that the banker was not surprised at his announcement well i suppose thats natural enough youll want to make a start for yourself now only of course for the sake of appearances oh certainly millner hastily agreed well then is that all mr spence repeated nearly millner paused as if in search of an appropriate formula but after a moment he gave up the search and pulled from his pocket an envelope which he held out to his employer i merely want to give this back the hand which mr spence had extended dropped to his side and his sandcoloured face grew chalky give it back his voice was as thick as millners whats happened is the bargain off oh no ive given you my word your word mr spence lowered at him id like to know what thats worth millner continued to hold out the envelope you do know now its worth that its worth my place mr spence standing motionless before him hesitated for an appreciable space of time his lips parted once or twice under their squareclipped stubble and at last emitted how much more do you want millner broke into a laugh oh ive got all i want all and more what from the others are you crazy no you are said millner with a sudden recovery of composure but youre safe youre as safe as youll ever be only i dont care to take this for making you so mr spence slowly moistened his lips with his tongue and removing his pincenez took a long hard look at millner i dont understand what other guarantee have i got that i mean what i say millner glanced past the bankers figure at his rich densely coloured background of spanish leather and mahogany he remembered that it was from this very threshold that he had first seen mr spences son what guarantee youve got draper he said afterward i oh there is one of course but youll never know it the assertion laughingly flung out six months earlier in a bright june garden came back to mary boyne with a sharp perception of its latent significance as she stood in the december dusk waiting for the lamps to be brought into the library the words had been spoken by their friend alida stair as they sat at tea on her lawn at pangbourne in reference to the very house of which the library in question was the central the pivotal feature mary boyne and her husband in quest of a country place in one of the southern or southwestern counties had on their arrival in england carried their problem straight to alida stair who had successfully solved it in her own case but it was not until they had rejected almost capriciously several practical and judicious suggestions that she threw it out well theres lyng in dorsetshire it belongs to hugos cousins and you can get it for a song the reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms its remoteness from a station its lack of electric light hotwater pipes and other vulgar necessities were exactly those pleading in its favor with two romantic americans perversely in search of the economic drawbacks which were associated in their tradition with unusual architectural felicities i should never believe i was living in an old house unless i was thoroughly uncomfortable ned boyne the more extravagant of the two had jocosely insisted the least hint of convenience would make me think it had been bought out of an exhibition with the pieces numbered and set up again and they had proceeded to enumerate with humorous precision their various suspicions and exactions refusing to believe that the house their cousin recommended was really tudor till they learned it had no heating system or that the village church was literally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable uncertainty of the watersupply its too uncomfortable to be true edward boyne had continued to exult as the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her but he had cut short his rhapsody to ask with a sudden relapse to distrust and the ghost youve been concealing from us the fact that there is no ghost mary at the moment had laughed with him yet almost with her laugh being possessed of several sets of independent perceptions had noted a sudden flatness of tone in alidas answering hilarity oh dorsetshires full of ghosts you know yes yes but that wont do i dont want to have to drive ten miles to see somebody elses ghost i want one of my own on the premises is there a ghost at lyng his rejoinder had made alida laugh again and it was then that she had flung back tantalizingly oh there is one of course but youll never know it never know it boyne pulled her up but what in the world constitutes a ghost except the fact of its being known for one i cant say but thats the story that theres a ghost but that nobody knows its a ghost well not till afterward at any rate till afterward not till long long afterward but if its once been identified as an unearthly visitant why hasnt its signalement been handed down in the family how has it managed to preserve its incognito alida could only shake her head dont ask me but it has and then suddenly mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of divination suddenly long afterward one says to ones self that was it she was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question fell on the banter of the other two and she saw the shadow of the same surprise flit across alidas clear pupils i suppose so one just has to wait oh hang waiting ned broke in lifes too short for a ghost who can only be enjoyed in retrospect cant we do better than that mary but it turned out that in the event they were not destined to for within three months of their conversation with mrs stair they were established at lyng and the life they had yearned for to the point of planning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for them it was to sit in the thick december dusk by just such a widehooded fireplace under just such black oak rafters with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude it was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that mary boyne had endured for nearly fourteen years the souldeadening ugliness of the middle west and that boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering till with a suddenness that still made her blink the prodigious windfall of the blue star mine had put them at a stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it they had never for a moment meant their new state to be one of idleness but they meant to give themselves only to harmonious activities she had her vision of painting and gardening against a background of gray walls he dreamed of the production of his longplanned book on the economic basis of culture and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered they could not get far enough from the world or plunge deep enough into the past dorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of remoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position but to the boynes it was one of the everrecurring wonders of the whole incredibly compressed island a nest of counties as they put it that for the production of its effects so little of a given quality went so far that so few miles made a distance and so short a distance a difference its that ned had once enthusiastically explained that gives such depth to their effects such relief to their least contrasts theyve been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful the butter had certainly been laid on thick at lyng the old gray house hidden under a shoulder of the downs had almost all the finer marks of commerce with a protracted past the mere fact that it was neither large nor exceptional made it to the boynes abound the more richly in its special sense the sense of having been for centuries a deep dim reservoir of life the life had probably not been of the most vivid order for long periods no doubt it had fallen as noiselessly into the past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell hour after hour into the green fishpond between the yews but these backwaters of existence sometimes breed in their sluggish depths strange acuities of emotion and mary boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an intenser memory the feeling had never been stronger than on the december afternoon when waiting in the library for the belated lamps she rose from her seat and stood among the shadows of the hearth her husband had gone off after luncheon for one of his long tramps on the downs she had noticed of late that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions and in the tried security of their personal relations had been driven to conclude that his book was bothering him and that he needed the afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the mornings work certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined it would and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been there in his engineering days then he had often looked fagged to the verge of illness but the native demon of worry had never branded his brow yet the few pages he had so far read to her the introduction and a synopsis of the opening chapter gave evidences of a firm possession of his subject and a deepening confidence in his powers the fact threw her into deeper perplexity since now that he had done with business and its disturbing contingencies the one other possible element of anxiety was eliminated unless it were his health then but physically he had gained since they had come to dorsetshire grown robuster ruddier and freshereyed it was only within a week that she had felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his absence and as tonguetied in his presence as though it were she who had a secret to keep from him the thought that there was a secret somewhere between them struck her with a sudden smart rap of wonder and she looked about her down the dim long room can it be the house she mused the room itself might have been full of secrets they seemed to be piling themselves up as evening fell like the layers and layers of velvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling the dusky walls of books the smokeblurred sculpture of the hooded hearth why of course the house is haunted she reflected the ghost alidas imperceptible ghost after figuring largely in the banter of their first month or two at lyng had been gradually discarded as too ineffectual for imaginative use mary had indeed as became the tenant of a haunted house made the customary inquiries among her few rural neighbors but beyond a vague they du say so maam the villagers had nothing to impart the elusive specter had apparently never had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it and after a time the boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their profitandloss account agreeing that lyng was one of the few houses good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancements and i suppose poor ineffectual demon thats why it beats its beautiful wings in vain in the void mary had laughingly concluded or rather ned answered in the same strain why amid so much thats ghostly it can never affirm its separate existence as the ghost and thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their references which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the loss now as she stood on the hearth the subject of their earlier curiosity revived in her with a new sense of its meaning a sense gradually acquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking mystery it was the house itself of course that possessed the ghostseeing faculty that communed visually but secretly with its own past and if one could only get into close enough communion with the house one might surprise its secret and acquire the ghostsight on ones own account perhaps in his long solitary hours in this very room where she never trespassed till the afternoon her husband had acquired it already and was silently carrying the dread weight of whatever it had revealed to him mary was too wellversed in the code of the spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts one saw to do so was almost as great a breach of goodbreeding as to name a lady in a club but this explanation did not really satisfy her what after all except for the fun of the frisson she reflected would he really care for any of their old ghosts and thence she was thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma the fact that ones greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular bearing on the case since when one did see a ghost at lyng one did not know it not till long afterward alida stair had said well supposing ned had seen one when they first came and had known only within the last week what had happened to him more and more under the spell of the hour she threw back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy but at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking settling arranging of books and calling to each other from remote corners of the house as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to them it was in this particular connection that she presently recalled a certain soft afternoon of the previous october when passing from the first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the old house she had pressed like a novel heroine a panel that opened at her touch on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat ledge of the roof the roof which from below seemed to slope away on all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale the view from this hidden coign was enchanting and she had flown down to snatch ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery she remembered still how standing on the narrow ledge he had passed his arm about her while their gaze flew to the long tossed horizonline of the downs and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque of yew hedges about the fishpond and the shadow of the cedar on the lawn and now the other way he had said gently turning her about within his arm and closely pressed to him she had absorbed like some long satisfying draft the picture of the graywalled court the squat lions on the gates and the limeavenue reaching up to the highroad under the downs it was just then while they gazed and held each other that she had felt his arm relax and heard a sharp hullo that made her turn to glance at him distinctly yes she now recalled she had seen as she glanced a shadow of anxiety of perplexity rather fall across his face and following his eyes had beheld the figure of a man a man in loose grayish clothes as it appeared to her who was sauntering down the limeavenue to the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way her shortsighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness and grayness with something foreign or at least unlocal in the cut of the figure or its garb but her husband had apparently seen more seen enough to make him push past her with a sharp wait and dash down the twisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descent a slight tendency to dizziness obliged her after a provisional clutch at the chimney against which they had been leaning to follow him down more cautiously and when she had reached the attic landing she paused again for a less definite reason leaning over the oak banister to strain her eyes through the silence of the brown sunflecked depths below she lingered there till somewhere in those depths she heard the closing of a door then mechanically impelled she went down the shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hall the front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court and hall and court were empty the library door was open too and after listening in vain for any sound of voices within she quickly crossed the threshold and found her husband alone vaguely fingering the papers on his desk he looked up as if surprised at her precipitate entrance but the shadow of anxiety had passed from his face leaving it even as she fancied a little brighter and clearer than usual what was it who was it she asked who he repeated with the surprise still all on his side the man we saw coming toward the house boyne shrugged his shoulders so i thought but he must have got up steam in the interval what do you say to our trying a scramble up meldon steep before sunset that was all at the time the occurrence had been less than nothing had indeed been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first vision from meldon steep a height which they had dreamed of climbing ever since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the low roof of lyng doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incidents having occurred on the very day of their ascent to meldon that had kept it stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now emerged for in itself it had no mark of the portentous at the moment there could have been nothing more natural than that ned should dash himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen it was the period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the specialists employed about the place always lying in wait for them and dashing out at them with questions reproaches or reminders and certainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like peters yet now as she reviewed the rapid scene she felt her husbands explanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his face why had the familiar appearance of peters made him anxious why above all if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that authority on the subject of the stabledrains had the failure to find him produced such a look of relief mary could not say that any one of these considerations had occurred to her at the time yet from the promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons she had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there waiting their hour ii weary with her thoughts she moved toward the window the library was now completely dark and she was surprised to see how much faint light the outer world still held as she peered out into it across the court a figure shaped itself in the tapering perspective of bare lines it looked a mere blot of deeper gray in the grayness and for an instant as it moved toward her her heart thumped to the thought its the ghost she had time in that long instant to feel suddenly that the man of whom two months earlier she had a brief distant vision from the roof was now at his predestined hour about to reveal himself as not having been peters and her spirit sank under the impending fear of the disclosure but almost with the next tick of the clock the ambiguous figure gaining substance and character showed itself even to her weak sight as her husbands and she turned away to meet him as he entered with the confession of her folly its really too absurd she laughed out from the threshold but i never can remember remember what boyne questioned as they drew together that when one sees the lyng ghost one never knows it her hand was on his sleeve and he kept it there but with no response in his gesture or in the lines of his fagged preoccupied face did you think youd seen it he asked after an appreciable interval why i actually took you for it my dear in my mad determination to spot it me just now his arm dropped away and he turned from her with a faint echo of her laugh really dearest youd better give it up if thats the best you can do yes i give it up i give it up have you she asked turning round on him abruptly the parlormaid had entered with letters and a lamp and the light struck up into boynes face as he bent above the tray she presented have you mary perversely insisted when the servant had disappeared on her errand of illumination have i what he rejoined absently the light bringing out the sharp stamp of worry between his brows as he turned over the letters i never tried he said tearing open the wrapper of a newspaper well of course mary persisted the exasperating thing is that theres no use trying since one cant be sure till so long afterward he was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her but after a pause during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands he lifted his head to say abruptly have you any idea how long mary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace from her seat she looked up startled at her husbands profile which was darkly projected against the circle of lamplight no none have you she retorted repeating her former phrase with an added keenness of intention boyne crumpled the paper into a bunch and then inconsequently turned back with it toward the lamp lord no i only meant he explained with a faint tinge of impatience is there any legend any tradition as to that not that i know of she answered but the impulse to add what makes you ask was checked by the reappearance of the parlormaid with tea and a second lamp with the dispersal of shadows and the repetition of the daily domestic office mary boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of something mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon for a few moments she gave herself silently to the details of her task and when she looked up from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment by the change in her husbands face he had seated himself near the farther lamp and was absorbed in the perusal of his letters but was it something he had found in them or merely the shifting of her own point of view that had restored his features to their normal aspect the longer she looked the more definitely the change affirmed itself the lines of painful tension had vanished and such traces of fatigue as lingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental effort he glanced up as if drawn by her gaze and met her eyes with a smile im dying for my tea you know and heres a letter for you he said she took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffered him and returning to her seat broke the seal with the languid gesture of the reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one cherished presence her next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet the letter falling to them as she rose while she held out to her husband a long newspaper clipping ned whats this what does it mean he had risen at the same instant almost as if hearing her cry before she uttered it and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied each other like adversaries watching for an advantage across the space between her chair and his desk whats what you fairly made me jump boyne said at length moving toward her with a sudden halfexasperated laugh the shadow of apprehension was on his face again not now a look of fixed foreboding but a shifting vigilance of lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his feeling himself invisibly surrounded her hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clipping this article from the waukesha sentinel that a man named elwell has brought suit against you that there was something wrong about the blue star mine i cant understand more than half they continued to face each other as she spoke and to her astonishment she saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating the strained watchfulness of his look oh that he glanced down the printed slip and then folded it with the gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar whats the matter with you this afternoon mary i thought youd got bad news she stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under the reassuring touch of his composure you knew about this then its all right certainly i knew about it and its all right but what is it i dont understand what does this man accuse you of oh pretty nearly every crime in the calendar boyne had tossed the clipping down and thrown himself comfortably into an armchair near the fire do you want to hear the story its not particularly interesting just a squabble over interests in the blue star but who is this elwell i dont know the name oh hes a fellow i put into it gave him a hand up i told you all about him at the time i daresay i must have forgotten vainly she strained back among her memories but if you helped him why does he make this return oh probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over its all rather technical and complicated i thought that kind of thing bored you his wife felt a sting of compunction theoretically she deprecated the american wifes detachment from her husbands professional interests but in practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention on boynes report of the transactions in which his varied interests involved him besides she had felt from the first that in a community where the amenities of living could be obtained only at the cost of efforts as arduous as her husbands professional labors such brief leisure as they could command should be used as an escape from immediate preoccupations a flight to the life they always dreamed of living once or twice now that this new life had actually drawn its magic circle about them she had asked herself if she had done right but hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of an active fancy now for the first time it startled her a little to find how little she knew of the material foundation on which her happiness was built she glanced again at her husband and was reassured by the composure of his face yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurance but doesnt this suit worry you why have you never spoken to me about it he answered both questions at once i didnt speak of it at first because it did worry me annoyed me rather but its all ancient history now your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of the sentinel she felt a quick thrill of relief you mean its over hes lost his case there was a just perceptible delay in boynes reply the suits been withdrawn thats all but she persisted as if to exonerate herself from the inward charge of being too easily put off withdrawn because he saw he had no chance oh he had no chance boyne answered she was still struggling with a dimly felt perplexity at the back of her thoughts how long ago was it withdrawn he paused as if with a slight return of his former uncertainty ive just had the news now but ive been expecting it just now in one of your letters yes in one of my letters she made no answer and was aware only after a short interval of waiting that he had risen and strolling across the room had placed himself on the sofa at her side she felt him as he did so pass an arm about her she felt his hand seek hers and clasp it and turning slowly drawn by the warmth of his cheek she met the smiling clearness of his eyes its all right its all right she questioned through the flood of her dissolving doubts and i give you my word it never was righter he laughed back at her holding her close iii one of the strangest things she was afterward to recall out of all the next days incredible strangeness was the sudden and complete recovery of her sense of security it was in the air when she woke in her lowceilinged dusky room it accompanied her downstairs to the breakfasttable flashed out at her from the fire and reduplicated itself brightly from the flanks of the urn and the sturdy flutings of the georgian teapot it was as if in some roundabout way all her diffused apprehensions of the previous day with their moment of sharp concentration about the newspaper article as if this dim questioning of the future and startled return upon the past had between them liquidated the arrears of some haunting moral obligation if she had indeed been careless of her husbands affairs it was her new state seemed to prove because her faith in him instinctively justified such carelessness and his right to her faith had overwhelmingly affirmed itself in the very face of menace and suspicion she had never seen him more untroubled more naturally and unconsciously in possession of himself than after the crossexamination to which she had subjected him it was almost as if he had been aware of her lurking doubts and had wanted the air cleared as much as she did it was as clear thank heaven as the bright outer light that surprised her almost with a touch of summer when she issued from the house for her daily round of the gardens she had left boyne at his desk indulging herself as she passed the library door by a last peep at his quiet face where he bent pipe in his mouth above his papers and now she had her own mornings task to perform the task involved on such charmed winter days almost as much delighted loitering about the different quarters of her demesne as if spring were already at work on shrubs and borders there were such inexhaustible possibilities still before her such opportunities to bring out the latent graces of the old place without a single irreverent touch of alteration that the winter months were all too short to plan what spring and autumn executed and her recovered sense of safety gave on this particular morning a peculiar zest to her progress through the sweet still place she went first to the kitchengarden where the espaliered peartrees drew complicated patterns on the walls and pigeons were fluttering and preening about the silveryslated roof of their cot there was something wrong about the piping of the hothouse and she was expecting an authority from dorchester who was to drive out between trains and make a diagnosis of the boiler but when she dipped into the damp heat of the greenhouses among the spiced scents and waxy pinks and reds of oldfashioned exotics even the flora of lyng was in the note she learned that the great man had not arrived and the day being too rare to waste in an artificial atmosphere she came out again and paced slowly along the springy turf of the bowlinggreen to the gardens behind the house at their farther end rose a grass terrace commanding over the fishpond and the yew hedges a view of the long housefront with its twisted chimneystacks and the blue shadows of its roof angles all drenched in the pale gold moisture of the air seen thus across the level tracery of the yews under the suffused mild light it sent her from its open windows and hospitably smoking chimneys the look of some warm human presence of a mind slowly ripened on a sunny wall of experience she had never before had so deep a sense of her intimacy with it such a conviction that its secrets were all beneficent kept as they said to children for ones good so complete a trust in its power to gather up her life and neds into the harmonious pattern of the long long story it sat there weaving in the sun she heard steps behind her and turned expecting to see the gardener accompanied by the engineer from dorchester but only one figure was in sight that of a youngish slightly built man who for reasons she could not on the spot have specified did not remotely resemble her preconceived notion of an authority on hothouse boilers the newcomer on seeing her lifted his hat and paused with the air of a gentleman perhaps a traveler desirous of having it immediately known that his intrusion is involuntary the local fame of lyng occasionally attracted the more intelligent sightseer and mary halfexpected to see the stranger dissemble a camera or justify his presence by producing it but he made no gesture of any sort and after a moment she asked in a tone responding to the courteous deprecation of his attitude is there any one you wish to see i came to see mr boyne he replied his intonation rather than his accent was faintly american and mary at the familiar note looked at him more closely the brim of his soft felt hat cast a shade on his face which thus obscured wore to her shortsighted gaze a look of seriousness as of a person arriving on business and civilly but firmly aware of his rights past experience had made mary equally sensible to such claims but she was jealous of her husbands morning hours and doubtful of his having given any one the right to intrude on them have you an appointment with mr boyne she asked he hesitated as if unprepared for the question not exactly an appointment he replied then im afraid this being his workingtime that he cant receive you now will you give me a message or come back later the visitor again lifting his hat briefly replied that he would come back later and walked away as if to regain the front of the house as his figure receded down the walk between the yew hedges mary saw him pause and look up an instant at the peaceful housefront bathed in faint winter sunshine and it struck her with a tardy touch of compunction that it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a distance and to offer in that case to inquire if her husband could receive him but as the thought occurred to her he passed out of sight behind a pyramidal yew and at the same moment her attention was distracted by the approach of the gardener attended by the bearded pepperandsalt figure of the boilermaker from dorchester the encounter with this authority led to such farreaching issues that they resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train and beguiled mary into spending the remainder of the morning in absorbed confabulation among the greenhouses she was startled to find when the colloquy ended that it was nearly luncheontime and she half expected as she hurried back to the house to see her husband coming out to meet her but she found no one in the court but an undergardener raking the gravel and the hall when she entered it was so silent that she guessed boyne to be still at work behind the closed door of the library not wishing to disturb him she turned into the drawingroom and there at her writingtable lost herself in renewed calculations of the outlay to which the mornings conference had committed her the knowledge that she could permit herself such follies had not yet lost its novelty and somehow in contrast to the vague apprehensions of the previous days it now seemed an element of her recovered security of the sense that as ned had said things in general had never been righter she was still luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the parlormaid from the threshold roused her with a dubiously worded inquiry as to the expediency of serving luncheon it was one of their jokes that trimmle announced luncheon as if she were divulging a state secret and mary intent upon her papers merely murmured an absentminded assent she felt trimmle wavering expressively on the threshold as if in rebuke of such offhand acquiescence then her retreating steps sounded down the passage and mary pushing away her papers crossed the hall and went to the library door it was still closed and she wavered in her turn disliking to disturb her husband yet anxious that he should not exceed his normal measure of work as she stood there balancing her impulses the esoteric trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon and mary thus impelled opened the door and went into the library boyne was not at his desk and she peered about her expecting to discover him at the bookshelves somewhere down the length of the room but her call brought no response and gradually it became clear to her that he was not in the library she turned back to the parlormaid mr boyne must be upstairs please tell him that luncheon is ready the parlormaid appeared to hesitate between the obvious duty of obeying orders and an equally obvious conviction of the foolishness of the injunction laid upon her the struggle resulted in her saying doubtfully if you please madam mr boynes not upstairs not in his room are you sure im sure madam mary consulted the clock where is he then hes gone out trimmle announced with the superior air of one who has respectfully waited for the question that a wellordered mind would have first propounded marys previous conjecture had been right then boyne must have gone to the gardens to meet her and since she had missed him it was clear that he had taken the shorter way by the south door instead of going round to the court she crossed the hall to the glass portal opening directly on the yew garden but the parlormaid after another moment of inner conflict decided to bring out recklessly please madam mr boyne didnt go that way mary turned back where did he go and when he went out of the front door up the drive madam it was a matter of principle with trimmle never to answer more than one question at a time up the drive at this hour mary went to the door herself and glanced across the court through the long tunnel of bare limes but its perspective was as empty as when she had scanned it on entering the house did mr boyne leave no message she asked trimmle seemed to surrender herself to a last struggle with the forces of chaos no madam he just went out with the gentleman the gentleman what gentleman mary wheeled about as if to front this new factor the gentleman who called madam said trimmle resignedly when did a gentleman call do explain yourself trimmle only the fact that mary was very hungry and that she wanted to consult her husband about the greenhouses would have caused her to lay so unusual an injunction on her attendant and even now she was detached enough to note in trimmles eye the dawning defiance of the respectful subordinate who has been pressed too hard i couldnt exactly say the hour madam because i didnt let the gentleman in she replied with the air of magnanimously ignoring the irregularity of her mistresss course you didnt let him in no madam when the bell rang i was dressing and agnes go and ask agnes then mary interjected trimmle still wore her look of patient magnanimity agnes would not know madam for she had unfortunately burnt her hand in trying the wick of the new lamp from town trimmle as mary was aware had always been opposed to the new lamp and so mrs dockett sent the kitchenmaid instead mary looked again at the clock its after two go and ask the kitchenmaid if mr boyne left any word she went into luncheon without waiting and trimmle presently brought her there the kitchenmaids statement that the gentleman had called about one oclock that mr boyne had gone out with him without leaving any message the kitchenmaid did not even know the callers name for he had written it on a slip of paper which he had folded and handed to her with the injunction to deliver it at once to mr boyne mary finished her luncheon still wondering and when it was over and trimmle had brought the coffee to the drawingroom her wonder had deepened to a first faint tinge of disquietude it was unlike boyne to absent himself without explanation at so unwonted an hour and the difficulty of identifying the visitor whose summons he had apparently obeyed made his disappearance the more unaccountable mary boynes experience as the wife of a busy engineer subject to sudden calls and compelled to keep irregular hours had trained her to the philosophic acceptance of surprises but since boynes withdrawal from business he had adopted a benedictine regularity of life as if to make up for the dispersed and agitated years with their standup lunches and dinners rattled down to the joltings of the diningcar he cultivated the last refinements of punctuality and monotony discouraging his wifes fancy for the unexpected and declaring that to a delicate taste there were infinite gradations of pleasure in the fixed recurrences of habit still since no life can completely defend itself from the unforeseen it was evident that all boynes precautions would sooner or later prove unavailable and mary concluded that he had cut short a tiresome visit by walking with his caller to the station or at least accompanying him for part of the way this conclusion relieved her from farther preoccupation and she went out herself to take up her conference with the gardener thence she walked to the village postoffice a mile or so away and when she turned toward home the early twilight was setting in she had taken a footpath across the downs and as boyne meanwhile had probably returned from the station by the highroad there was little likelihood of their meeting on the way she felt sure however of his having reached the house before her so sure that when she entered it herself without even pausing to inquire of trimmle she made directly for the library but the library was still empty and with an unwonted precision of visual memory she immediately observed that the papers on her husbands desk lay precisely as they had lain when she had gone in to call him to luncheon then of a sudden she was seized by a vague dread of the unknown she had closed the door behind her on entering and as she stood alone in the long silent shadowy room her dread seemed to take shape and sound to be there audibly breathing and lurking among the shadows her shortsighted eyes strained through them halfdiscerning an actual presence something aloof that watched and knew and in the recoil from that intangible propinquity she threw herself suddenly on the bellrope and gave it a desperate pull the long quavering summons brought trimmle in precipitately with a lamp and mary breathed again at this sobering reappearance of the usual you may bring tea if mr boyne is in she said to justify her ring very well madam but mr boyne is not in said trimmle putting down the lamp not in you mean hes come back and gone out again no madam hes never been back the dread stirred again and mary knew that now it had her fast not since he went out with the gentleman not since he went out with the gentleman but who was the gentleman mary gasped out with the sharp note of some one trying to be heard through a confusion of meaningless noises that i couldnt say madam trimmle standing there by the lamp seemed suddenly to grow less round and rosy as though eclipsed by the same creeping shade of apprehension but the kitchenmaid knows wasnt it the kitchenmaid who let him in she doesnt know either madam for he wrote his name on a folded paper mary through her agitation was aware that they were both designating the unknown visitor by a vague pronoun instead of the conventional formula which till then had kept their allusions within the bounds of custom and at the same moment her mind caught at the suggestion of the folded paper but he must have a name where is the paper she moved to the desk and began to turn over the scattered documents that littered it the first that caught her eye was an unfinished letter in her husbands hand with his pen lying across it as though dropped there at a sudden summons my dear parvis who was parvis i have just received your letter announcing elwells death and while i suppose there is now no farther risk of trouble it might be safer she tossed the sheet aside and continued her search but no folded paper was discoverable among the letters and pages of manuscript which had been swept together in a promiscuous heap as if by a hurried or a startled gesture but the kitchenmaid saw him send her here she commanded wondering at her dullness in not thinking sooner of so simple a solution trimmle at the behest vanished in a flash as if thankful to be out of the room and when she reappeared conducting the agitated underling mary had regained her selfpossession and had her questions pat the gentleman was a stranger yes that she understood but what had he said and above all what had he looked like the first question was easily enough answered for the disconcerting reason that he had said so little had merely asked for mr boyne and scribbling something on a bit of paper had requested that it should at once be carried in to him then you dont know what he wrote youre not sure it was his name the kitchenmaid was not sure but supposed it was since he had written it in answer to her inquiry as to whom she should announce and when you carried the paper in to mr boyne what did he say the kitchenmaid did not think that mr boyne had said anything but she could not be sure for just as she had handed him the paper and he was opening it she had become aware that the visitor had followed her into the library and she had slipped out leaving the two gentlemen together but then if you left them in the library how do you know that they went out of the house this question plunged the witness into momentary inarticulateness from which she was rescued by trimmle who by means of ingenious circumlocutions elicited the statement that before she could cross the hall to the back passage she had heard the gentlemen behind her and had seen them go out of the front door together then if you saw the gentleman twice you must be able to tell me what he looked like but with this final challenge to her powers of expression it became clear that the limit of the kitchenmaids endurance had been reached the obligation of going to the front door to show in a visitor was in itself so subversive of the fundamental order of things that it had thrown her faculties into hopeless disarray and she could only stammer out after various panting efforts at evocation his hat mum was differentlike as you might say different how different mary flashed out at her her own mind in the same instant leaping back to an image left on it that morning but temporarily lost under layers of subsequent impressions his hat had a wide brim you mean and his face was pale a youngish face mary pressed her with a whitelipped intensity of interrogation but if the kitchenmaid found any adequate answer to this challenge it was swept away for her listener down the rushing current of her own convictions the stranger the stranger in the garden why had mary not thought of him before she needed no one now to tell her that it was he who had called for her husband and gone away with him but who was he and why had boyne obeyed his call iv it leaped out at her suddenly like a grin out of the dark that they had often called england so little such a confoundedly hard place to get lost in a confoundedly hard place to get lost in that had been her husbands phrase and now with the whole machinery of official investigation sweeping its flashlights from shore to shore and across the dividing straits now with boynes name blazing from the walls of every town and village his portrait how that wrung her hawked up and down the country like the image of a hunted criminal now the little compact populous island so policed surveyed and administered revealed itself as a sphinxlike guardian of abysmal mysteries staring back into his wifes anguished eyes as if with the malicious joy of knowing something they would never know in the fortnight since boynes disappearance there had been no word of him no trace of his movements even the usual misleading reports that raise expectancy in tortured bosoms had been few and fleeting no one but the bewildered kitchenmaid had seen him leave the house and no one else had seen the gentleman who accompanied him all inquiries in the neighborhood failed to elicit the memory of a strangers presence that day in the neighborhood of lyng and no one had met edward boyne either alone or in company in any of the neighboring villages or on the road across the downs or at either of the local railwaystations the sunny english noon had swallowed him as completely as if he had gone out into cimmerian night mary while every external means of investigation was working at its highest pressure had ransacked her husbands papers for any trace of antecedent complications of entanglements or obligations unknown to her that might throw a faint ray into the darkness but if any such had existed in the background of boynes life they had disappeared as completely as the slip of paper on which the visitor had written his name there remained no possible thread of guidance except if it were indeed an exception the letter which boyne had apparently been in the act of writing when he received his mysterious summons that letter read and reread by his wife and submitted by her to the police yielded little enough for conjecture to feed on i have just heard of elwells death and while i suppose there is now no farther risk of trouble it might be safer that was all the risk of trouble was easily explained by the newspaper clipping which had apprised mary of the suit brought against her husband by one of his associates in the blue star enterprise the only new information conveyed in the letter was the fact of its showing boyne when he wrote it to be still apprehensive of the results of the suit though he had assured his wife that it had been withdrawn and though the letter itself declared that the plaintiff was dead it took several weeks of exhaustive cabling to fix the identity of the parvis to whom the fragmentary communication was addressed but even after these inquiries had shown him to be a waukesha lawyer no new facts concerning the elwell suit were elicited he appeared to have had no direct concern in it but to have been conversant with the facts merely as an acquaintance and possible intermediary and he declared himself unable to divine with what object boyne intended to seek his assistance this negative information sole fruit of the first fortnights feverish search was not increased by a jot during the slow weeks that followed mary knew that the investigations were still being carried on but she had a vague sense of their gradually slackening as the actual march of time seemed to slacken it was as though the days flying horrorstruck from the shrouded image of the one inscrutable day gained assurance as the distance lengthened till at last they fell back into their normal gait and so with the human imaginations at work on the dark event no doubt it occupied them still but week by week and hour by hour it grew less absorbing took up less space was slowly but inevitably crowded out of the foreground of consciousness by the new problems perpetually bubbling up from the vaporous caldron of human experience even mary boynes consciousness gradually felt the same lowering of velocity it still swayed with the incessant oscillations of conjecture but they were slower more rhythmical in their beat there were moments of overwhelming lassitude when like the victim of some poison which leaves the brain clear but holds the body motionless she saw herself domesticated with the horror accepting its perpetual presence as one of the fixed conditions of life these moments lengthened into hours and days till she passed into a phase of stolid acquiescence she watched the familiar routine of life with the incurious eye of a savage on whom the meaningless processes of civilization make but the faintest impression she had come to regard herself as part of the routine a spoke of the wheel revolving with its motion she felt almost like the furniture of the room in which she sat an insensate object to be dusted and pushed about with the chairs and tables and this deepening apathy held her fast at lyng in spite of the urgent entreaties of friends and the usual medical recommendation of change her friends supposed that her refusal to move was inspired by the belief that her husband would one day return to the spot from which he had vanished and a beautiful legend grew up about this imaginary state of waiting but in reality she had no such belief the depths of anguish inclosing her were no longer lighted by flashes of hope she was sure that boyne would never come back that he had gone out of her sight as completely as if death itself had waited that day on the threshold she had even renounced one by one the various theories as to his disappearance which had been advanced by the press the police and her own agonized imagination in sheer lassitude her mind turned from these alternatives of horror and sank back into the blank fact that he was gone no she would never know what had become of him no one would ever know but the house knew the library in which she spent her long lonely evenings knew for it was here that the last scene had been enacted here that the stranger had come and spoken the word which had caused boyne to rise and follow him the floor she trod had felt his tread the books on the shelves had seen his face and there were moments when the intense consciousness of the old dusky walls seemed about to break out into some audible revelation of their secret but the revelation never came and she knew it would never come lyng was not one of the garrulous old houses that betray the secrets intrusted to them its very legend proved that it had always been the mute accomplice the incorruptible custodian of the mysteries it had surprised and mary boyne sitting face to face with its portentous silence felt the futility of seeking to break it by any human means v i dont say it wasnt straight yet dont say it was straight it was business mary at the words lifted her head with a start and looked intently at the speaker when half an hour before a card with mr parvis on it had been brought up to her she had been immediately aware that the name had been a part of her consciousness ever since she had read it at the head of boynes unfinished letter in the library she had found awaiting her a small neutraltinted man with a bald head and gold eyeglasses and it sent a strange tremor through her to know that this was the person to whom her husbands last known thought had been directed parvis civilly but without vain preamble in the manner of a man who has his watch in his hand had set forth the object of his visit he had run over to england on business and finding himself in the neighborhood of dorchester had not wished to leave it without paying his respects to mrs boyne without asking her if the occasion offered what she meant to do about bob elwells family the words touched the spring of some obscure dread in marys bosom did her visitor after all know what boyne had meant by his unfinished phrase she asked for an elucidation of his question and noticed at once that he seemed surprised at her continued ignorance of the subject was it possible that she really knew as little as she said i know nothing you must tell me she faltered out and her visitor thereupon proceeded to unfold his story it threw even to her confused perceptions and imperfectly initiated vision a lurid glare on the whole hazy episode of the blue star mine her husband had made his money in that brilliant speculation at the cost of getting ahead of some one less alert to seize the chance the victim of his ingenuity was young robert elwell who had put him on to the blue star scheme parvis at marys first startled cry had thrown her a sobering glance through his impartial glasses bob elwell wasnt smart enough thats all if he had been he might have turned round and served boyne the same way its the kind of thing that happens every day in business i guess its what the scientists call the survival of the fittest said mr parvis evidently pleased with the aptness of his analogy mary felt a physical shrinking from the next question she tried to frame it was as though the words on her lips had a taste that nauseated her but then you accuse my husband of doing something dishonorable mr parvis surveyed the question dispassionately oh no i dont i dont even say it wasnt straight he glanced up and down the long lines of books as if one of them might have supplied him with the definition he sought i dont say it wasnt straight and yet i dont say it was straight it was business after all no definition in his category could be more comprehensive than that mary sat staring at him with a look of terror he seemed to her like the indifferent implacable emissary of some dark formless power but mr elwells lawyers apparently did not take your view since i suppose the suit was withdrawn by their advice oh yes they knew he hadnt a leg to stand on technically it was when they advised him to withdraw the suit that he got desperate you see hed borrowed most of the money he lost in the blue star and he was up a tree thats why he shot himself when they told him he had no show the horror was sweeping over mary in great deafening waves he shot himself he killed himself because of that well he didnt kill himself exactly he dragged on two months before he died parvis emitted the statement as unemotionally as a gramophone grinding out its record you mean that he tried to kill himself and failed and tried again oh he didnt have to try again said parvis grimly they sat opposite each other in silence he swinging his eyeglass thoughtfully about his finger she motionless her arms stretched along her knees in an attitude of rigid tension but if you knew all this she began at length hardly able to force her voice above a whisper how is it that when i wrote you at the time of my husbands disappearance you said you didnt understand his letter parvis received this without perceptible discomfiture why i didnt understand it strictly speaking and it wasnt the time to talk about it if i had the elwell business was settled when the suit was withdrawn nothing i could have told you would have helped you to find your husband mary continued to scrutinize him then why are you telling me now still parvis did not hesitate well to begin with i supposed you knew more than you appear to i mean about the circumstances of elwells death and then people are talking of it now the whole matters been raked up again and i thought if you didnt know you ought to she remained silent and he continued you see its only come out lately what a bad state elwells affairs were in his wifes a proud woman and she fought on as long as she could going out to work and taking sewing at home when she got too sick something with the heart i believe but she had his bedridden mother to look after and the children and she broke down under it and finally had to ask for help that attracted attention to the case and the papers took it up and a subscription was started everybody out there liked bob elwell and most of the prominent names in the place are down on the list and people began to wonder why parvis broke off to fumble in an inner pocket here he continued heres an account of the whole thing from the sentinel a little sensational of course but i guess youd better look it over he held out a newspaper to mary who unfolded it slowly remembering as she did so the evening when in that same room the perusal of a clipping from the sentinel had first shaken the depths of her security as she opened the paper her eyes shrinking from the glaring headlines widow of boynes victim forced to appeal for aid ran down the column of text to two portraits inserted in it the first was her husbands taken from a photograph made the year they had come to england it was the picture of him that she liked best the one that stood on the writingtable upstairs in her bedroom as the eyes in the photograph met hers she felt it would be impossible to read what was said of him and closed her lids with the sharpness of the pain i thought if you felt disposed to put your name down she heard parvis continue she opened her eyes with an effort and they fell on the other portrait it was that of a youngish man slightly built in rough clothes with features somewhat blurred by the shadow of a projecting hatbrim where had she seen that outline before she stared at it confusedly her heart hammering in her throat and ears then she gave a cry this is the man the man who came for my husband she heard parvis start to his feet and was dimly aware that she had slipped backward into the corner of the sofa and that he was bending above her in alarm with an intense effort she straightened herself and reached out for the paper which she had dropped its the man i should know him anywhere she cried in a voice that sounded in her own ears like a scream parviss voice seemed to come to her from far off down endless fogmuffled windings mrs boyne youre not very well shall i call somebody shall i get a glass of water no no no she threw herself toward him her hand frantically clenching the newspaper i tell you its the man i know him he spoke to me in the garden parvis took the journal from her directing his glasses to the portrait it cant be mrs boyne its robert elwell robert elwell her white stare seemed to travel into space then it was robert elwell who came for him came for boyne the day he went away parviss voice dropped as hers rose he bent over laying a fraternal hand on her as if to coax her gently back into her seat why elwell was dead dont you remember mary sat with her eyes fixed on the picture unconscious of what he was saying dont you remember boynes unfinished letter to me the one you found on his desk that day it was written just after hed heard of elwells death she noticed an odd shake in parviss unemotional voice surely you remember that he urged her yes she remembered that was the profoundest horror of it elwell had died the day before her husbands disappearance and this was elwells portrait and it was the portrait of the man who had spoken to her in the garden she lifted her head and looked slowly about the library the library could have borne witness that it was also the portrait of the man who had come in that day to call boyne from his unfinished letter through the misty surgings of her brain she heard the faint boom of halfforgotten words words spoken by alida stair on the lawn at pangbourne before boyne and his wife had ever seen the house at lyng or had imagined that they might one day live there this was the man who spoke to me she repeated she looked again at parvis he was trying to conceal his disturbance under what he imagined to be an expression of indulgent commiseration but the edges of his lips were blue he thinks me mad but im not mad she reflected and suddenly there flashed upon her a way of justifying her strange affirmation she sat quiet controlling the quiver of her lips and waiting till she could trust her voice to keep its habitual level then she said looking straight at parvis will you answer me one question please when was it that robert elwell tried to kill himself when when parvis stammered yes the date please try to remember she saw that he was growing still more afraid of her i have a reason she insisted gently yes yes only i cant remember about two months before i should say i want the date she repeated parvis picked up the newspaper we might see here he said still humoring her he ran his eyes down the page here it is last october the she caught the words from him the th wasnt it with a sharp look at her he verified yes the th then you did know i know now her white stare continued to travel past him sunday the th that was the day he came first parviss voice was almost inaudible came here first yes you saw him twice then yes twice she breathed it at him with dilated eyes he came first on the th of october i remember the date because it was the day we went up meldon steep for the first time she felt a faint gasp of inward laughter at the thought that but for that she might have forgotten parvis continued to scrutinize her as if trying to intercept her gaze we saw him from the roof she went on he came down the limeavenue toward the house he was dressed just as he is in that picture my husband saw him first he was frightened and ran down ahead of me but there was no one there he had vanished elwell had vanished parvis faltered yes their two whispers seemed to grope for each other i couldnt think what had happened i see now he tried to come then but he wasnt dead enough he couldnt reach us he had to wait for two months and then he came back again and ned went with him she nodded at parvis with the look of triumph of a child who has successfully worked out a difficult puzzle but suddenly she lifted her hands with a desperate gesture pressing them to her bursting temples oh my god i sent him to ned i told him where to go i sent him to this room she screamed out she felt the walls of the room rush toward her like inward falling ruins and she heard parvis a long way off as if through the ruins crying to her and struggling to get at her but she was numb to his touch she did not know what he was saying through the tumult she heard but one clear note the voice of alida stair speaking on the lawn at pangbourne you wont know till afterward it said you wont know till long long afterward the letters i up the long hill from the station at stcloud lizzie west climbed in the cold spring sunshine as she breasted the incline she noticed the first waves of wistaria over courtyard railings and the high lights of new foliage against the walls of ivymatted gardens and she thought again as she had thought a hundred times before that she had never seen so beautiful a spring she was on her way to the deerings house in a street near the hilltop and every step was dear and familiar to her she went there five times a week to teach little juliet deering the daughter of mr vincent deering the distinguished american artist juliet had been her pupil for two years and day after day during that time lizzie west had mounted the hill in all weathers sometimes with her umbrella bent against a driving rain sometimes with her frail cotton parasol unfurled beneath a fiery sun sometimes with the snow soaking through her patched boots or a bitter wind piercing her thin jacket sometimes with the dust whirling about her and bleaching the flowers of the poor little hat that had to carry her through till next summer at first the ascent had seemed tedious enough as dull as the trudge to her other lessons lizzie was not a heavensent teacher she had no born zeal for her calling and though she dealt kindlyand dutifully with her pupils she did not fly to them on winged feet but one day something had happened to change the face of life and since then the climb to the deering house had seemed like a dreamflight up a heavenly stairway her heart beat faster as she remembered it no longer in a tumult of fright and selfreproach but softly peacefully as ifbrooding over a possession that none could take from her it was on a day of the previous october that she had stopped after juliets lesson to ask if she might speak to juliets papa one had always to apply to mr deering if there was anything to be said about the lessons mrs deering lay on her lounge upstairs reading greasy relays of dogeared novels the choice of which she left to the cook and the nurse who were always fetching them forher from the cabinet de lecture and it was understood inthe house that she was not to be bothered about juliet mr deerings interest in his daughter was fitful rather than consecutive but at least he was approachable and listened sympathetically if a little absently stroking his long fair mustache while lizzie stated her difficulty or put in her plea for maps or copybooks yes yes of course whatever you think right he would always assent sometimes drawing a fivefranc piece from his pocket and laying it carelessly on the table or oftener saying with his charming smile get what you please and just put it onyour account you know but this time lizzie had not come to ask for maps or copybooks or even to hint in crimson misery as once poor soul she had had to do that mr deering had overlooked her last little account had probably not noticed that she had left it some two months earlier on a corner of his littered writingtable that hour had been bad enough though he had done his best to make it easy to carry it off gallantly and gaily but this was infinitely worse for she had come to complain of her pupil to say that much as she loved little juliet it was useless unless mr deering could do something to go on with the lessons it wouldnt be honest i should be robbing you im not sure that i havent already she half laughed through mounting tears as she put her case little juliet would not work would not obey her poor little drifting existence floated aimlessly between the kitchen and the lingerie and all the groping tendrils ofher curiosity were fastened about the doings of the backstairs it was the same kind of curiosity that mrs deering overhead in her drugscented room lavished on her dogeared novels and onthe society notes of the morning paper but since juliets horizon was not yet wide enough to embrace these loftier objects her interest was centered in the anecdotes that celeste and suzanne brought back from the market and the library that these were not always of an edifying nature the childs artless prattle too often betrayed but unhappily they occupied her fancy to the complete exclusion of such nourishing items as dates and dynasties and the sources of the principal european rivers at length the crisis became so acute that poor lizzie felt herself bound to resign her charge or ask mr deerings intervention and for juliets sake she chose the harder alternative it was hard to speak to him not onlybecause one hated still more to ascribe it to such vulgar causes but becauseone blushed to bring them to the notice of a spirit engaged with higher things mr deering was very busy at that moment he had a new picture on and lizzie entered the studio with the flutterof one profanely intruding on some sacred rite she almost heard the rustle of retreating wings as she approached and then and then how differently it had all turned out perhaps it wouldnt have if she hadnt been such a goose she who so seldom cried so prided herself on a stoic control of her little twittering cageful of feelings but if she had cried it was because he had looked at her so kindly so softly and because she had nevertheless felt him so pained and shamed by what she said the pain of course lay for both in the implication behind her words in the one word they left unspoken if little juliet was as she was it was because of the mother upstairs the mother who had given her child her futile impulses and grudged her the care that might have guided them the wretched case so obviously revolved in its own vicious circle that when mr deering had murmured of course if my wife were not an invalid they both turned with a simultaneous spring to the flagrant bad example of celeste and suzanne fastening on that with a mutual insistence that ended inhis crying out all the more then how can you leave her to them but if i do her no good lizzie wailed and it was then that when he took her hand and assured her gently but you do you do it was then that in the traditional phrase she brokedown and her conventional protest quivered off into tears you do me good at any rate you make the houseseem less like a desert she heard him say and the next moment she felt herself drawn to him and they kissed each other through her weeping they kissed each other there was the new fact one does not if one is a poor little teacher living in mme clopins pension suisse at passy and if one has pretty brown hair and eyes that reach out trustfully to other eyes one does not under these common but defenseless conditions arrive at the age of twentyfive without being now and then kissed waylaid once by a noisy student between two doors surprised once by ones graybearded professoras one bent over the theme he was correcting but these episodes if they tarnish the surface do not reach the heart itis not the kiss endured but the kiss returned that lives and lizzie wests first kiss was for vincent deering as she drew back from it something new awoke in her something deeper than the fright and the shame and the penitent thought of mrs deering a sleeping germ of life thrilled and unfolded and started out blindly to seek the sun she might have felt differently perhaps the shame and penitence might have prevailed had she not known him so kind and tender and guessed him so baffled poor and disappointed she knew the failure of his married life and she divined a corresponding failure in his artistic career lizzie who had made her own faltering snatch at the same laurels brought her thwarted proficiency to bear on the question of his pictures which she judged to be extremely brilliant but suspected of having somehowfailed to affirm their merit publicly she understood that he had tasted an earlier moment of success a mention a medal something official and tangible then the tide of publicity had somehow setthe other way and left him stranded in a noble isolation it was extraordinary and unbelievable that any one so naturally eminent and exceptional should have been subject to the same vulgar necessities that governed her own life should have known povertyand obscurity and indifference but she gathered that this had been the case and felt that it formed the miraculous link between them for through what medium less revealing than that of sharedmisfortune would he ever have perceived so inconspicuous an object as herself and she recalled now how gently his eyes had rested on her from the first the gray eyes that might have seemed mocking if they had not been so gentle she remembered how he had met her the first day when mrs deerings inevitable headache had prevented her from receiving the new teacher and how his few questions had at once revealed his interest in the little stranded compatriot doomed to earn a precarious living so far from her native shore sweet as the moment of unburdening had been she wondered afterward what had determined it how she so shy and sequestered had found herselfletting slip her whole povertystricken story even to the avowalof the ineffectual artistic tendencies that had drawn her to paris and had then left her there to the dry task of tuition she wondered at first but she understood now she understood everything after he had kissed her it was simply because he wasas kind as he was great she thought of this now as she mounted the hill in the spring sunshine and she thought of all that had happened since the intervening months as she looked back at them were merged in a vast golden haze through which here and there rose the outline of a shining island the haze was the general enveloping sense of his love and the shining islands were the days they had spent together they had never kissed again under his own roof lizzies professional honor had a keen edge but she had been spared the vulgar necessity of making him feel it it was of theessence of her fatality that he always understood when his failing to do so might have imperiled his hold on her but her thursdays and sundays were free and it soon became a habit to give them to him she knew for her peace of mind onlytoo much about pictures and galleries and churches had been the one bright outlet from the grayness of her personal atmosphere for poetry too and the other imaginative forms of literature she had always felt more than she had hitherto had occasion to betray and now all these folded sympathies shot out their tendrils to the light mr deering knew how to express with unmatched clearness and competence the thoughts that trembled in her mind to talk with him was to soar up into the azure on the outspread wings of his intelligence and look down dizzily yet distinctly on all the wonders and glories of the world she was a little ashamed sometimes to find how few definite impressions she brought back from these flights but that was doubtless because her heart beatso fast when he was near and his smile made his words like a long quiver of light afterward in quieter hours fragments of theirtalk emerged in her memory with wondrous precision every syllable as minutely chiseled as some of the delicate objects in crystal or ivory that he pointed out in the museums they frequented it wasalways a puzzle to lizzie that some of their hours should be so blurred and others so vivid on the morning in question she was reliving all these memories with unusual distinctness for it was a fortnight since she had seen her friend mrs deering some six weeks previously had gone to visit a relation at straphael and after she had been a month absent her husband and the little girl had joined her lizziesadieux to deering had been made on a rainy afternoon in the damp corridors of the aquarium at the trocadero she could not receive him at her own pension that a teacher should bevisited by the father of a pupil especially when that father wasstill as madame clopin said si bien was against that ladys austere helvetian code from deerings first tentative hint of another solution lizzie had recoiled in a wild unreasoned flurry of all her scruples he took her no no no as he tookall her twists and turns of conscience with eyes halftender and halfmocking and an instant acquiescence which was the finest homage to the lady she felt he divined and honored in her so they continued to meet in museums and galleries or to extend on fine days their explorations to the suburbs where now and then in the solitude of grove or garden the kiss renewed itself fleeting isolated or prolonged in a shy silent pressure of the hand but on the day of his leavetaking the rain kept them under cover and as they threaded the subterranean windings of the aquarium and lizzie looked unseeingly at the monstrous faces glaring at her through walls of glass she felt like a poor drowned wretch at the bottom of the sea with all her glancing sunlit memories rolling over her like the waves of its surface youll never see him again never see him again the wavesboomed in her ears through his last words and when she had said goodby to him at the corner and had scrambled wet and shivering into the passy omnibus its great grinding wheels took up the derisive burden never see him never see him again all that was only two weeks ago and here she was as happy as a lark mounting the hill to his door in the spring sunshine soweak a heart did not deserve such a radiant fate and lizzie saidto herself that she would never again distrust her star ii the cracked bell tinkled sweetly through her heart as she stood listening for the scamper of juliets feet juliet anticipatingthe laggard suzanne almost always opened the door for her governess not from any unnatural zeal to hasten the hour of her studies but from the irrepressible desire to see what was going on in the street but on this occasion lizzie listened vainly for astep and at length gave the bell another twitch doubtless someunusually absorbing incident had detained the child belowstairs thus only could her absence be explained a third ring produced no response and lizzie full of dawning fears drew back to look up at the shabby blistered house she saw that the studio shutters stood wide and then noticed without surprise that mrs deerings were still unopened no doubt mrs deering was resting after the fatigue of the journey instinctively lizzies eyes turned again to the studio and as she looked she saw deering at the window he caught sight of her and an instant later came to the door he looked paler than usual and she noticed that he wore a black coat i rang and rang where is juliet he looked at her gravely almost solemnly then without answering he led her down the passage to the studio and closed the door when she had entered my wife is dead she died suddenly ten days ago didnt you see it in the papers lizzie with a little cry sank down on the rickety divan she seldom saw a newspaper since she could not afford one for her own perusal and those supplied to the pension clopin were usually in the hands of its more privileged lodgers till long after the hour when she set out on her morning round no i didnt see it she stammered deering was silent he stood a little way off twisting an unlit cigarette in his hand and looking down at her with a gaze that was both hesitating and constrained she too felt the constraint of the situation the impossibility of finding words that after what had passed between them should seem neither false nor heartless and at last she exclaimed standing up poor little juliet cant i go to her juliet is not here i left her at straphael with the relations with whom my wife was staying oh lizzie murmured feeling vaguely that this added to the difficulty of the moment how differently she had pictured theirmeeting im so so sorry for her she faltered out deering made no reply but turning on his heel walked the length of the studio and then halted vaguely before the picture on the easel it was the landscape he had begun the previous autumn with the intention of sending it to the salon that spring but it was still unfinished seemed indeed hardly moreadvanced than on the fateful october day when lizzie standing before it for the first time had confessed her inability to dealwith juliet perhaps the same thought struck its creator for hebroke into a dry laugh and turned from the easel with a shrug under his protracted silence lizzie roused herself to the fact that since her pupil was absent there was no reason for her remaining any longer and as deering again moved toward her she said with an effort ill go then youll send for me when shecomes back deering still hesitated tormenting the cigarette between his fingers shes not coming back not at present lizzie heard him with a drop of the heart was everything to be changed in their lives but of course how could she have dreamed it would be otherwise she could only stupidly repeat not coming back not this spring probably not since are friends are so good as to keep her the fact is ive got to go to america my wife left a little property a few pennies that i must go and see to for the child lizzie stood before him a cold knife in her breast i see i see she reiterated feeling all the while that she strained her eyes into impenetrable blackness its a nuisance having to pull up stakes he went on with a fretful glance about the studio she lifted her eyes slowly to his face shall you be gone long she took courage to ask there again i cant tell its all so frightfully mixed up he met her look for an incredibly long strange moment ihate to go he murmured as if to himself lizzie felt a rush of moisture to her lashes and the old familiar wave of weakness at her heart she raised her hand to her face with an instinctive gesture and as she did so he held out his arms come here lizzie he said and she went went with a sweet wild throb of liberation with the sense that at last the house was his that she was his if he wanted her that never again would that silent rebuking presence in the room above constrain and shame her rapture he pushed back her veil and covered her face with kisses dont cry you little goose he said iii that they must see each other again before his departure in someplace less exposed than their usual haunts was as clear to lizzie as it appeared to be to deering his expressing the wish seemed indeed the sweetest testimony to the quality of his feeling since in the first weeks of the most perfunctory widowerhood a man of his stamp is presumed to abstain from light adventures if then at such a moment he wished so much to be quietly and gravely with her it could be only for reasons she did not call by name but of which she felt the sacred tremor in her heart and it would have seemed incredibly vain and vulgar to put forward at such a crisis the conventional objections by means of which such littleexposed existences defend the treasure of their freshness in such a mood as this one may descend from the passy omnibus at the corner of the pont de la concorde she had not let him fetch her in a cab with a sense of dedication almost solemn and may advance to meet ones fate in the shape of a gentleman of melancholy elegance with an autotaxi at his call as one has advanced to the altarsteps in some girlish bridal vision even the experienced waiter ushering them into an upper roomof the quiet restaurant on the seine could hardly have supposed their quest for seclusion to be based on sentimental motives so soberly did deering give his orders while his companion sat small and grave at his side she did not indeed mean to let her private pang obscure their hour together she was already learning that deering shrank from sadness he should see that she had courage and gaiety to face their coming separation and yet give herself meanwhile to this completer nearness but she waited as always for him to strike the opening note looking back at it later she wondered at the mild suavity of the hour her heart was unversed inhappiness but he had found the tone to lull her apprehensions and make her trust her fate for any golden wonder deepest of all he gave her the sense of something tacit and confirmed between them as if his tenderness were a habit of the heart hardly needing the support of outward proof such proof as he offered came therefore as a kind of crowning luxury the flower of a profoundly rooted sentiment andhere again the instinctive reserves and defenses would have seemed to vulgarize what his trust ennobled but if all the tender casuistries of her heart were at his service he took no grave advantage of them even when they sat alone after dinner with the lights of the river trembling through their one low window and the vast rumor of paris inclosing them in a heart of silence he seemed as much as herself under the spell of hallowing influences she felt it most of all as she yielded to the arm hepresently put about her to the long caress he laid on her lips and eyes not a word or gesture missed the note of quiet union or cast a doubt in retrospect on the pact they sealed with their last look that pact as she reviewed it through a sleepless night seemed to have consisted mainly on his part in pleadings for full and frequent news of her on hers in the assurance that it shouldbe given as often as he asked it she had felt an intense desirenot to betray any undue eagerness any crude desire to affirm anddefine her hold on him her life had given her a certain acquaintance with the arts of defense girls in her situation were commonly supposed to know them all and to use them as occasion called but lizzies very need of them had intensified her disdain just because she was so poor and had always materially so to count her change and calculate her margin she would at least know the joy of emotional prodigality would give her heart as recklessly as the rich their millions she was sure now that deering loved her and if he had seized the occasion of their farewell to give her some definitely worded sign of his feeling if more plainly he had asked her to marry him his doing so would have seemed less like a proof of his sincerity than of his suspecting in her the need of a verbal warrant that he had abstained seemed to show that he trusted her as she trusted him and that they were one most of all in this deep security of understanding she had tried to make him divine all this in the chariness of her promise to write she would write of course she would buthe would be busy preoccupied on the move it was for him to lether know when he wished a word to spare her the embarrassment ofilltimed intrusions intrusions he had smiled the word away you cant wellintrude my darling on a heart where youre already established to the complete exclusion of other lodgers and then taking her hands and looking up from them into her happy dizzy eyes you dont know much about being in love do you lizzie he laughingly ended it seemed easy enough to reject this imputation in a kiss but she wondered afterward if she had not deserved it was she really cold and conventional and did other women give more richly and recklessly she found that it was possible to turn about every one of her reserves and delicacies so that they looked like selfish scruples and petty pruderies and at this game she came in time to exhaust all the resources of an overabundant casuistry meanwhile the first days after deerings departure wore a soft refracted light like the radiance lingering after sunset he at any rate was taxable with no reserves nocalculations and his letters of farewell from train and steamer filled her with long murmurs and echoes of his presence how he loved her how he loved her and how he knew how to tell her so she was not sure of possessing the same aptitude unused tothe expression of personal emotion she fluctuated between the impulse to pour out all she felt and the fear lest her extravagance should amuse or even bore him she never lost the sense that what was to her the central crisis of experience must be a mere episode in a life so predestined as his to romantic accidents all that she felt and said would be subjected to the test of comparison with what others had already given him from all quarters of the globeshe saw passionate missives winging their way toward deering forwhom her poor little swallowflight ofdevotion could certainly not make a summer but such moments were succeeded by others in which she raised her head and dared inwardly to affirm her conviction that no woman had ever loved him just as she had and that none therefore had probably found just such things to say to him and this conviction strengthened the other less solidly based belief that he also for the same reason had found new accents to express his tenderness and that the three letters she wore all day in her shabby blouse and hid all night beneath her pillow surpassed not only in beauty but in quality all he had ever penned for other eyes they gave her at any rate during the weeks that she wore them on her heart sensations even more complex and delicate than deerings actual presence had ever occasioned to be with him was always like breasting a bright rough sea that blinded while it buoyed her but his letters formed a still pool of contemplation above which she could bend and see the reflection of the sky and the myriad movements of life that flitted and gleamed below the surface the wealth of his hidden life that was what most surprised her it was incredible to her now that she had had no inkling of it but had kept on blindly along the narrow track of habit like a traveler climbing a road in a fog who suddenly finds himself on a sunlit crag between blue leagues of sky and dizzy depths of valley and the odd thing was that all the people about her the whole world of the passy pension were still plodding along the same dull path preoccupied with the pebbles underfoot and unconscious of the glory beyond the fog there were wild hours when she longed to cry out to them what one saw from the summit and hours of tremulous abasement when she asked herself why her happy feet had been guided there while others no doubt as worthy stumbled and blundered in obscurity she felt in particular a sudden urgent pity for the two or three other girls at mme clopins girls older duller less alive than she and by that very token more appealingly flung upon her sympathy would they ever know had they ever known those were the questions that haunted her as she crossed her companions on the stairs faced them at the dinnertable and listened to their poor pining talk in the dimlit slipperyseated salon one ofthe girls was swiss the other english the third andora macy was ayoung lady from the southern states who was studying french with the ultimate object of imparting it to the inmates of a girls school at macon georgia andora macy was pale faded immature she had a drooping southern accent and a manner which fluctuated between arch audacity and fits of panicky hauteur she yearned to be admired and feared to be insulted and yet seemed tragically conscious that she was destined to miss both these extremes of sensation or to enjoy them only at second hand in the experiences of her more privileged friends it was perhaps for this reason that she took a wistful interest in lizzie who had shrunk from her at first as the depressing image of her own probable future but to whom she had now suddenly become an object of sentimental pity iv miss macys room was next to miss wests and the southerners knock often appealed to lizzies hospitality when mme clopins early curfew had driven her boarders from the salon it sounded thus one evening just as lizzie tired from an unusually long day of tuition was in the act of removing her dress she was in too indulgent a mood to withhold her come in and as miss macy crossed the threshold lizzie felt that vincent deerings first letter the letter from the train had slipped from her loosened bodice to the floor miss macy as promptly noting the fact darted forward to recover the letter lizzie stooped also fiercely jealous of her touch but the other reached the precious paper first andas she seized it lizzie knew that she had seen whence it fell and was weaving round the incident a rapid web of romance lizzie blushed with annoyance its too stupid having no pockets if one gets a letter as she is going out in the morning she has to carry it in her blouse all day miss macy looked at her with swimming eyes its warm fromyour heart she breathed reluctantly yielding up the missive lizzie laughed for she knew better she knew it was the letter that had warmed her heart poor andora macy she would never know her bleak bosom would never take fire from such a contact lizzie looked at her with kind eyes secretly chafing at the injustice of fate the next evening on her return home she found andora hovering in the entrance hall i thought youd like me to put this in your own hand miss macy whispered significantly pressing a letter upon lizzie i couldnt bear to see it lying on the table with theothers it was deerings letter from the steamer lizzie blushed tothe forehead but without resenting andoras divination she could not have breathed a word of her bliss but she was not altogethersorry to have it guessed and pity for andoras destitution yielded to the pleasure of using it as a mirror for her own abundance deering wrote again on reaching new york a long fond dissatisfied letter vague in its indication of his own projects specific in the expression of his love lizzie brooded over every syllable of it till they formed the undercurrent of all her waking thoughts and murmured through her midnight dreams but she wouldhave been happier if they had shed some definite light on the future that would come no doubt when he had had time to look about and get his bearings she counted up the days that must elapse before she received his next letter and stole down early to peepat the papers and learn when the next american mail was due atlength the happy date arrived and she hurried distractedly through the days work trying to conceal her impatience by the endearments she bestowed upon her pupils it was easier in her present mood to kiss them than to keep them at their grammars that evening on mme clopins threshold her heart beat so wildly that she had to lean a moment against the doorpost beforeentering but on the hall table where the letters lay there was none for her she went over them with a feverish hand her heart dropping down and down as she had sometimes fallen down an endless stairway in a dream the very same stairway up which she had seemed to flywhen she climbed the long hill to deerings door then it suddenly struck her that andora might have found and secreted her letter and with a spring she was on the actual stairs and rattling miss macys doorhandle youve a letter for me havent you she panted miss macy turning from the toilettable inclosed her in attenuated arms oh darling did you expect one today do give it to me lizzie pleaded with burning eyes but i havent any there hasnt been a sign of a letter for you i know there is there must be lizzie persisted stamping her foot but dearest ive watched for you and theresbeen nothing absolutely nothing day after day for the ensuing weeks the same scene reenacted itself with endless variations lizzie after the first sharp spasm of disappointment made no effort to conceal her anxiety from miss macy and the fond andora was charged to keep a vigilant eyeupon the postmans coming and to spy on the bonne for possible negligence or perfidy but these elaborate precautions remained fruitless and no letter from deering came during the first fortnight of silence lizzie exhausted all the ingenuities of explanation she marveled afterward at the reasons she had found for deerings silence there were moments when she almost argued herself into thinking it more natural than his continuing to write there was only one reason which her intelligence consistently rejected and that was the possibility that he had forgotten her that the wholeepisode had faded from his mind like a breath from a mirror from that she resolutely turned her thoughts aware that if she suffered herself to contemplate it the motive power of life would fail and she would no longer understand why she rose up in the morning and laydown at night if she had had leisure to indulge her anguish she might havebeen unable to keep such speculations at bay but she had to be up and working the blanchisseuse had to be paid and mme clopins weekly bill and all the little extras that even her frugal habits had to reckon with and in the depths of her thought dwelt the dogging fear of illness and incapacity goading her to work while she could she hardly remembered the time when she had been without that fear it was second nature now and it kept her on her feet when other incentives might have failed in the blankness of her misery shefelt no dread of death but the horror of being ill and dependent was in her blood in the first weeks of silence she wrote again and again to deering entreating him for a word for a mere sign of life from the first she had shrunk from seeming to assert any claim on his future yet in her aching bewilderment she now charged herself with having been too possessive too exacting in her tone she told herself that his fastidiousness shrank from any but a light touch and that hers had not been light enough she should havekept to the character of the little friend the artless consciousness in which tormented genius may find an escape from its complexities and instead she had dramatized their relation exaggerated her own part in it presumed forsooth to share the front of the stage with him instead of being content to serve asscenery or chorus but though to herself she admitted and even insisted on the episodical nature of the experience on the fact that for deeringit could be no more than an incident she was still convinced that his sentiment for her however fugitive had been genuine his had not been the attitude of the unscrupulous male seeking a vulgar advantage for a moment he had really needed her andif he was silent now it was perhaps because he feared that she had mistaken the nature of the need and built vain hopes on its possible duration it was of the very essence of lizzies devotion that it sought instinctively the larger freedom of its object she could not conceive of love under any form of exaction or compulsion to make this clear to deering became an overwhelming need and in a last short letter she explicitly freed him from whatever sentimental obligation its predecessors might have seemed to impose in thisstudied communication she playfully accused herself of having unwittingly sentimentalized their relation affirming in selfdefense a retrospective astuteness a sense of the impermanence of the tenderer sentiments that almost put deering in the fatuous position of having mistaken coquetry for surrender and she ended gracefully with a plea for the continuance of the friendly regardwhich she had always understood to be the basis of their sympathy the document when completed seemed to her worthy of what she conceived to be deerings conception of a woman of the world and she found a spectral satisfaction in the thought of making her final appearance before him in that distinguished character but she was never destined to learn what effect the appearance produced for the letter like those it sought to excuse remained unanswered v the fresh spring sunshine which had so often attended lizzie weston her dusty climb up the hill of stcloud beamed on her some two years later in a scene and a situation of altered import the horsechestnuts of the champselysees filtered its rays through the symmetrical umbrage inclosing the graveled space about daurents restaurant and miss west seated at a table within that privileged circle presented to the light a hat much better able to sustain its scrutiny than those which had sheltered the brow of juliet deerings instructress her dress was in keeping with the hat and both belonged to a situation rich in such possibilities as the act of a leisurely luncheon at daurents in the opening week of the salon her companions of both sexes confirmed and emphasized this impression by an elaborateness of garb and an ease of attitude implying the largest range of selection between the forms of parisian idleness and even andora macy seated opposite as in the place of cohostess or companion reflected in coy grays and mauves the festal note of the occasion this note reverberated persistently in the ears of a solitary gentleman straining for glimpses of the group from a table wedgedin the remotest corner of the garden but to miss west herself the occurrence did not rise above the usual for nearly a year she had been acquiring the habit of such situations and the act of offering a luncheon at daurents to her cousins the harvey mearses of providence and their friend mr jackson benn produced in herno emotion beyond the languid glow which mr benns presence was beginning to impart to such scenes its frightful the way youve got used to it andora macyhad wailed in the first days of her friends transfigured fortune when lizzie west had waked one morning to find herself among the heirs of an old and miserly cousin whose testamentary dispositions had formed since her earliest childhood the subject of pleasantry and conjecture in her own improvident family old hezron mears had never given any sign of life to the luckless wests had perhaps hardly been conscious of including them in the carefully drawn will which following the old american convention scrupulously divided his hoarded millions among his kin it was by a mere genealogical accident that lizzie falling just within the golden circle found herself possessed of a pittance sufficient to release her from the prospect of a long gray future in mme clopins pension the release had seemed wonderful at first yet she presentlyfound that it had destroyed her former world without giving her anew one on the ruins of the old pension life bloomed the only flower that had ever sweetened her path and beyond the sense of present ease and the removal of anxiety for the future her reconstructed existence blossomed with no compensating joys shehad hoped great things from the opportunity to rest to travel to look about her above all in various artful feminine ways to be nice to the companions of her less privileged state but such widenings of scope left her as it were but the more conscious of the empty margin of personal life beyond them it was not till she woke to the leisure of her new days that she had the full sense of what was gone from them their very emptiness made her strain to pack them with transient sensations she was like the possessor of an unfurnished house with random furniture and bricabrac perpetually pouring in on approval it was in this experimental character that mr jackson benn had fixed her attention and the languid effort of her imagination to adjust him to her requirements was seconded by thefond complicity of andora and the smiling approval of her cousins lizzie did not discourage these demonstrations she suffered serenely andoras allusions to mr benns infatuation and mrs mearss casual boast of his business standing all the better ifthey could drape his narrow squareshouldered frame and round unwinking countenance in the trailing mists of sentiment lizzie looked and listened not unhopeful of the miracle i never saw anything like the way these frenchmen stare doesnt it make you nervous lizzie mrs mears broke out suddenly ruffling her feather boa about an outraged bosom mrs mears was still in that stage of development when her countrywomen taste to the full the peril of being exposed to the gaze of the licentious gaul lizzie roused herself from the contemplation of mr benns round baby cheeks and the square blue jaw resting on his perpendicular collar is some one staring at me she asked with a smile dont turn round whatever you do there just over there between the rhododendrons the tall fair man alone at that table really harvey i think you ought to speak to the headwaiter orsomething though i suppose in one of these places theyd only laugh at you mrs mears shudderingly concluded her husband as if inclining to this probability continued the undisturbed dissection of his chicken wing but mr benn perhaps aware that his situation demanded a more punctilious attitude sternly revolved upon the parapet of his high collar inthe direction of mrs mearss glance what that fellow all alone over there why hes not french hes an american he then proclaimed with a perceptible relaxing of the facial muscles oh murmured mrs mears as perceptibly disappointed and mr benn continued carelessly he came over on the steamer with me hes some kind of an artist a fellow named deering he wasstaring at me i guess wondering whether i was going to remember him why how d e do how are you why yes of course with pleasure my friends mrs harvey mears mr mears my friends miss macy and miss west i have the pleasure of knowing miss west said vincent deering with a smile vi even through his smile lizzie had seen in the first moment how changed he was and the impression of the change deepened to the point of pain when a few days later in reply to his brief note she accorded him a private hour that the first sight of his writing the first answer to hisletters should have come after three long years in the shape of this impersonal line too curt to be called humble yet confessing to a consciousness of the past by the studied avoidance of its language as she read her mind flashed back over what she had dreamed his letters would be over the exquisite answers she had composed above his name there was nothing exquisite in the conventional lines before her but dormant nerves began to throb again at the mere touch of the paper he had touched and she threw the little note into the fire before she dared to reply to it now that he was actually before her again he became as usual the one live spot in her consciousness once more her tormented throbbing self sank back passive and numb but now withall its power of suffering mysteriously transferred to the presence so known yet so unknown at the opposite corner of herhearth she was still lizzie west and he was still vincent deering but the styx rolled between them and she saw his face through its fog it was his face really rather than his words that told her as she furtively studied it the tale of failure and slow discouragement which had so blurred its handsome lines shekept afterward no precise memory of the actual details of his narrative the pain it evidently cost him to impart it was so much the sharpest fact in her new vision of him confusedly however she gathered that on reaching america he had found his wifes small property gravely impaired and that while lingering on to securewhat remained of it he had contrived to sell a picture or two and had even known a brief moment of success during which he received orders and set up a studio but inexplicably the tide had ebbed his work remained on his hands and a tedious illness with its miserable sequel of debt soon wiped out his small advantage there followed a period of eclipse still more vaguely pictured during which she was allowed to infer that he had tried his hand at divers means of livelihood accepting employment from a fashionable housedecorator designing wallpapers illustrating magazine articles and acting for a time she dimly understood as the social tout of a new hotel desirous of advertising its restaurant these disjointed facts were strung on a slender thread of personal allusions references to friends who had been kind jealously she guessed them to be women and to enemies who had darkly schemed against him but true to his tradition of correctness he carefully avoided the mention of names and left her trembling conjectures to grope dimly through an alien crowded world in which there seemed little room for her small shy presence as she listened her private pang was merged in the intolerable sense of his unhappiness nothing he had said explained or excused his conduct to her but he had suffered he had been lonely had been humiliated and she suddenly felt with a fierce maternal rage that there was no conceivable justification for any scheme of things in which such facts were possible she could not have said why she simply knew that it hurt too much tosee him hurt gradually it came to her that her unconsciousness of any personal grievance was due to her having so definitely determinedher own future she was glad she had decided as she now felt she had to marry jackson benn if only for the sense of detachment it gave her in dealing with the case of vincent deering her personal safety insured her the requisite impartiality and justified her in dwelling as long as she chose on the last lines of a chapter to which her own act had deliberately fixed the close any lingering hesitations as to the finality of her decision were dispelled by the imminent need of making it known to deering and when her visitor paused in his reminiscences to say with a sigh but many things have happened to you too his words did not so much evokethe sense of her altered fortunes as the image of the protector to whom she was about to intrust them yes many things its three years she answered deering sat leaning forward in his sad exiled elegance hiseyes gently bent on hers and at his side she saw the solid form of mr jackson benn with shoulders preternaturally squared by the cut of his tight black coat and a tall shiny collar sustaining his baby cheeks and hard blue chin then the vision faded as deeringbegan to speak three years he repeated musingly taking up her words ive so often wondered what theyd brought you she lifted her head with a quick blush and the terrified wish that he should not at the cost of all his notions of correctness lapse into the blunder of becoming personal youve wondered she smiled back bravely do you suppose i havent his look dwelt on her yes idaresay that was what you thought of me she had her answer pat why frankly you know i didnt think of you but the mounting tide of her poor dishonored memories swept it indignantly away if it was his correctness toignore it could never be hers to disavow was that what you thought of me she heard himrepeat in a tone of sad insistence and at that with a quick lift of her head she resolutely answered how could i know what to think i had no word from you if she had expected and perhaps almost hoped that this answer would create a difficulty for him the gaze of quiet fortitude with which he met it proved that she had underestimatedhis resources no you had no word i kept my vow he said your vow that you shouldnt have a word not a syllable oh i kept it through everything lizzies heart was sounding in her ears the old confused rumor of the sea of life but through it she desperately tried to distinguish the still small voice of reason what was your vow why shouldnt i have had asyllable from you he sat motionless still holding her with a look so gentle that it almost seemed forgiving then abruptly he rose and crossing the space between them sat down in a chair at her side the deliberation of his movement might have implied a forgetfulness of changed conditions and lizzie as if thus viewing it drew slightly back but he appeared not to notice her recoil and his eyes at last leaving her face slowly and approvingly made the round of the small bright drawingroom this is charming yes things have changed foryou he said a moment before she had prayed that he might be spared the error of a vain return upon the past it was as if all her retrospective tenderness dreading to see him at such a disadvantage rose up to protect him from it but his evasiveness exasperated her and suddenly she felt the inconsistent desire tohold him fast face to face with his own words before she could reiterate her question however he had mether with another you did think of me then why are you afraid totell me that you did the unexpectedness of the challenge wrung an indignant cry from her didnt my letters tell you so enough ah your letters keeping her gaze on his in a passion ofunrelenting fixity she could detect in him no confusion not theleast quiver of a sensitive nerve he only gazed back at her more sadly they went everywhere with me your letters he said yet you never answered them at last the accusation trembled to her lips yet i never answered them did you ever so much as read them i wonder all the demons of selftorture were up in her now and she loosed them on him as if to escape from their rage deering hardly seemed to hear her question he merely shifted his attitude leaning a little nearer to her but without attempting by the least gesture to remind her of the privilegeswhich such nearness had once implied there were beautiful wonderful things in them he said smiling she felt herself stiffen under his smile youve waited three years to tell me so he looked at her with grave surprise and do you resent mytelling you even now his parries were incredible they left her with a breathless sense of thrusting at emptiness and a desperate almost vindictive desire to drive him against thewall and pin him there no only i wonder you should take the trouble to tell me when at the time and now with a sudden turn he gave her the final surprise of meeting her squarely on her own ground when at the time i didnt but how could i at thetime why couldnt you youve not yet told me he gave her again his look of disarming patience do i need to hasnt my whole wretched story told you told me why you never answered my letters yes since i could only answer them in one way by protesting my love and my longing there was a long pause of resigned expectancy on his part on hers of a wild confused reconstruction of her shattered past you mean then that you didnt write because because i found when i reached america that i was a pauper that my wifes money was gone and that what i could earn ive so little gift that way was barely enough to keep juliet clothed and educated it was as if an iron door had been suddenly locked andbarred between us lizzie felt herself driven back panting upon the last defenses of her incredulity you might at least have told me have explained do you think i shouldnt have understood he did not hesitate you would have understood it wasntthat what was it then she quavered its wonderful you shouldnt see simply that i couldnt write you that anything else not that and so you preferred to let me suffer there was a shade of reproach in his eyes i suffered too he said it was his first direct appeal to her compassion and for a moment it nearly unsettled the delicate poise of her sympathies and sent them trembling in the direction of scorn and irony buteven as the impulse rose it was stayed by another sensation once again as so often in the past she became aware of a fact which in his absence she always failed to reckon with the fact of thedeep irreducible difference between his image in her mind and hisactual self the mysterious alteration in her judgment produced by the inflections of his voice the look of his eyes the whole complex pressure of his personality she had phrased it once selfreproachfully by saying to herself that she never could rememberhim so completely did the sight of him supersede the counterfeit about which her fancy wove its perpetual wonders bright and breathing as that counterfeit was it became a gray figment of the mind at the touch of his presence and on this occasion the immediate result was to cause her to feel his possible unhappiness with an intensity beside which her private injury paled i suffered horribly he repeated and all the more that icouldnt make a sign couldnt cry out my misery there was onlyone escape from it all to hold my tongue and pray that you might hate me the blood rushed to lizzies forehead hate you you prayed that i might hate you he rose from his seat and moving closer lifted her hand gently in his yes because your letters showed me that if youdidnt youd be unhappier still her hand lay motionless with the warmth of his flowing through it and her thoughts too her poor fluttering stormy thoughts felt themselves suddenly penetrated by the same soft current of communion and i meant to keep my resolve he went on slowly releasing his clasp i meant to keep it even after the random stream of things swept me back here in your way but when i saw you the other day i felt that what had been possible at a distance was impossible now that we were near each other how was it possibleto see you and want you to hate me he had moved away but not to resume his seat he merely paused at a little distance his hand resting on a chairback inthe transient attitude that precedes departure lizzies heart contracted he was going then and this washis farewell he was going and she could find no word to detainhim but the senseless stammer i never hated you he considered her with his faint grave smile its not necessary at any rate that you should do so now time and circumstances have made me so harmless thats exactly why ive dared to venture back and i wanted to tell you how i rejoice inyour good fortune its the only obstacle between us that i cant bring myself to wish away lizzie sat silent spellbound as she listened by the sudden evocation of mr jackson benn he stood there again between herself and deering perpendicular and reproachful but less solid and sharply outlined than before with a look in his small hard eyes that desperately wailed for reembodiment deering was continuing his farewell speech youre rich now youre free you will marry she vaguely saw him holding out his hand its not true that im engaged she broke out they were the last words she had meant to utter they were hardly related to her conscious thoughts but she felt her whole will suddenly gathered up in the irrepressible impulse to repudiate and fling away from her forever the spectral claim of mr jackson benn vii it was the firm conviction of andora macy that every object in the vincent deerings charming little house at neuilly had been expressly designed for the deerings son to play with the house was full of pretty things some not obviously applicable to the purpose but miss macys casuistry was equal tothe babys appetite and the babys mother was no match for them in the art of defending her possessions there were moments in fact when lizzie almost fell in with andoras summary division of her works of art into articles safe or unsafe for the baby to lick or resisted it only to the extent of occasionally substituting some less precious or less perishable object for the particular fragility on which her sons desire was fixed and it was with this intention that on a certain fair spring morning which worethe added luster of being the babys second birthday she had murmured with her mouth in his curls and one hand holding a bitof chelsea above his dangerous clutch wouldnt he rather have that beautiful shiny thing over there in aunt andorras hand the two friends were together in lizzies little morningroom the room she had chosen on acquiring the house because when she sat there she could hear deerings step as he paced up and down before his easel in the studio she had built for him his step had been less regularly audible than she had hoped for after three years of wedded bliss he had somehow failed to settle downto the great work which was to result from that privileged state but even when she did not hear him she knew that he was there above her head stretched out on the old divan from passy and smoking endless cigarettes while he skimmed the morning papers and the sense of his nearness had not yet lost its first keen edge of bliss lizzie herself on the day in question was engaged in a more arduous task than the study of the mornings news she had neverunlearned the habit of orderly activity and the trait she least understood in her husbands character was his way of letting the loose ends of life hang as they would she had been disposed at first to ascribe this to the chronic incoherence of his first menage but now she knew that though he basked under therule of her beneficent hand he would never feel any active impulse to further its work he liked to see things fall into place about him at a wave of her wand but his enjoyment of her household magic in no way diminished his smiling irresponsibility and it was with one of its least amiable consequences that his wife and her friend were now dealing before them stood two travelworn trunks and a distended portmanteau which had shed their contents in heterogeneous heapsover lizzies rosy carpet they represented the hostages left byher husband on his somewhat precipitate departure from a new yorkboardinghouse and indignantly redeemed by her on her learning in a curt letter from his landlady that the latter was not disposedto regard them as an equivalent for the arrears of deerings board lizzie had not been shocked by the discovery that her husband had left america in debt she had too sad an acquaintance with the economic strain to see any humiliation in such accidents but it offended her sense of order that he should not have liquidated his obligation in the three years since their marriage he took her remonstrance with his usual disarming grace and left her to forward the liberating draft though her delicacy had provided him with a bankaccount which assured his personal independence lizzie had discharged the duty without repugnance since she knewthat his delegating it to her was the result of his goodhumored indolence and not of any design on her exchequer deering was not dazzled by money his altered fortunes had tempted him to no excesses he was simply too lazy to draw the check as he had been too lazy to remember the debt it canceled no dear no lizzie lifted the chelsea figure higher cant you find something for him andora among that rubbish over there wheres the beaded bag you had in your hand just now i dont think it could hurt him to lick that miss macy bag in hand rose from her knees and stumbled through the slough of frayed garments and old studio properties before the group of mother and son she fell into a raptured attitude do look at him reach for it the tyrant isnt he just like the young napoleon lizzie laughed and swung her son in air dangle it before him andora if you let him have it too quickly he wont care for it hes just like any man i think andora slowly lowered the shining bag till the heir of the deerings closed his masterful fist upon it there my chelseassafe lizzie smiled setting her boy on the floor and watchinghim stagger away with his booty andora stood beside her watching too have you any idea where that bag came from lizzie mrs deering bent above a pile of discollared shirts shook an inattentive head i never saw such wicked washing there isnt one thats fit to mend the bag no ive not the least idea andora surveyed her dramatically doesnt it make you utterly miserable to think that some woman may have made it for him lizzie bowed in anxious scrutiny above the shirts broke into an unruffled laugh really andora really six seven nine no there isnt even a dozen there isnt a whole dozen of anything i dont see how men live alone andora broodingly pursued her theme do you mean to tell me it doesnt make you jealous to handle these things of his that other women may have given him lizzie shook her head again and straightening herself with a smile tossed a bundle in her friends direction no it doesnt make me the least bit jealous here count these socks for me like a darling andora moaned dont you feel anything at all asthe socks landed in her hollow bosom but lizzie intent upon her task tranquilly continued to unfold and sort she felt a great deal as she did so but her feelings were too deep and delicate for the simplifying process of speech she only knew that each article she drew from the trunks sent through her the long tremor of deerings touch it was part of her wonderful new life that everything belonging to him contained an infinitesimal fraction of himself a fraction becoming visible in the warmth of her love as certain secret elements become visible in rare intensities of temperature and in the case of the objects before her poor shabby witnesses of his days of failure what they gave out acquired a special poignancy from its contrast to his present cherished state his shirts were all in round dozens now and washed as carefully as old lace as for his socks she knew the pattern of every pair and would have liked to see the washerwoman who dared to mislay one or bring it home with the colors run and in these homely tokens of his wellbeing she saw the symbol of what her tenderness had brought him he was safe in it encompassed by it morally and materially and she defied the embattled powers of malice to reach him through the armor of her love such feelings however were not communicable even had one desired to express them they wereno more to be distinguished from the sense of life itself than bees from the limeblossoms in which they murmur oh do look at him lizzie hes found out how toopen the bag lizzie lifted her head to smile a moment at her son who satthroned on a heap of studio rubbish with andora before him on adoring knees she thought vaguely poor andora and then resumed the discouraged inspection of a buttonless white waistcoat the next sound she was aware of was a fluttered exclamation from her friend why lizzie do you know what he used the bag for to keepyour letters in lizzie looked up more quickly she was aware that andoras pronoun had changed its object and was now applied to deering and it struck her as odd and slightly disagreeable that a letter of hers should be found among the rubbish abandoned in her husbands new york lodgings how funny give it to me please give the bag to aunt andora darling here look inside and see what else a big big boy can find there yes heres another why why lizzie rose with a shade of impatience and crossed the floorto the romping group beside the other trunk what is it give me the letters please as she spoke she suddenly recalled the day when in mme clopins pension she had addressed a similar behest to andora macy andora had lifted a look of startled conjecture why thisones never been opened do you suppose that awful woman could have kept it from him lizzie laughed andoras imaginings were really puerile what awful woman his landlady dont be such a goose andora how can it have been kept back from him when weve found it here among his things yes but then why was it never opened andora held out the letter and lizzie took it the writingwas hers the envelop bore the passy postmark and it was unopened she stood looking at it with a sudden sharp drop of the heart why so are the others all unopened andora threw out on a rising note but lizzie stooping over stretched out her hand give them to me please oh lizzie lizzie andora still on her knees continued to hold back the packet her pale face paler with anger and compassion lizzie theyre the letters i used to post for you the letters he never answered look give them back to me please the two women faced each other andora kneeling lizzie motionless before her the letters in her hand the blood had rushed to her face humming in her ears and forcing itself into the veins of her temples like hot lead then it ebbed and she felt cold and weak it must have been some plot some conspiracy andora cried so fired by the ecstasy of invention that for the moment she seemed lost to all but the esthetic aspect of the case lizzie turned away her eyes with an effort and they rested on the boy who sat at her feet placidly sucking the tassels of the bag his mother stooped and extracted them from his rosy mouth which a cry of wrath immediately filled she lifted him in her arms and for the first time no current of life ran from his bodyinto hers he felt heavy and clumsy like some one elses child and his screams annoyed her take him away please andora oh lizzie lizzie andora wailed lizzie held out the child and andora struggling to her feet received him i know just how you feel she gasped out above the babys head lizzie in some dark hollow of herself heard the echo of a laugh andora always thought she knew how people felt tell marthe to take him with her when she fetches juliet home from school yes yes andora gloated over her if youd only give way my darling the baby howling dived over andoras shoulder for the bag oh take him his mother ordered andora from the door cried out ill be back at once remember love youre not alone but lizzie insisted go with them i wish you to go with them in the tone to which miss macy had never learned the answer the door closed on her outraged back and lizzie stood alone she looked about the disordered room which offered a dreary image of the havoc of her life an hour or two ago everything about her had been so exquisitely ordered without and within her thoughtsand emotions had lain outspread before her like delicate jewels laid away symmetrically in a collectors cabinet now they had been tossed down helterskelter among the rubbish there on the floor and had themselves turned to rubbish like the rest yes there lay her life at her feet among all that tarnished trash she knelt and picked up her letters ten in all and examined the flaps of the envelops not one had been opened not one asshe looked every word she had written fluttered to life and every feeling prompting it sent a tremor through her with vertiginousspeed and microscopic vision she was reliving that whole period of her life stripping bare again the black ruin over which the drift of three happy years had fallen she laughed at andoras notion of a conspiracy of the letters having been kept back she required no extraneous aid in deciphering the mystery her three years experience of deering shed on it all the light she needed and yet a moment before shehad believed herself to be perfectly happy now it was the worstpart of her anguish that it did not really surprise her she knew so well how it must have happened the letters hadreached him when he was busy occupied with something else and had been put aside to be read at some future time a time which nevercame perhaps on his way to america on the steamer even he had met some one else the some one who lurks veiled and ominous in the background of every womans thoughts about her lover or perhaps he had been merely forgetful she had learned from experience that the sensations which he seemed to feel with the most exquisite intensity left no reverberations in his mind thathe did not relive either his pleasures or his pains she needed no better proof of that than the lightness of his conduct toward hisdaughter he seemed to have taken it for granted that juliet would remain indefinitely with the friends who had received her after her mothers death and it was at lizzies suggestion that the littlegirl was brought home and that they had established themselves at neuilly to be near her school but juliet once with them he became the model of a tender father and lizzie wondered that he had not felt the childs absence since he seemed so affectionately aware of her presence lizzie had noted all this in juliets case but had taken for granted that her own was different that she formed for deering the exception which every woman secretly supposes herself to formin the experience of the man she loves certainly she had learned by this time that she could not modify his habits but she imagined that she had deepened his sensibilities had furnished him with an ideal angelic function and she now saw that the fact of her letters her unanswered letters having on his own assurance meant so much to him had been the basis on which this beautiful fabric was reared there they lay now the letters precisely as when they had left her hands he had not had time to read them and there had been a moment in her past when that discovery would have been thesharpest pang imaginable to her heart she had traveled far beyond that point she could have forgiven him now for having forgottenher but she could never forgive him for having deceived her she sat down and looked again vaguely about the room suddenly she heard his step overhead and her heart contracted she was afraid he was coming down to her she sprang up and bolted the door then she dropped into the nearest chair tremulous and exhausted as if the pushing of the bolt had required an immense muscular effort a moment later she heard him on the stairs andher tremor broke into a cold fit of shaking i loathe you i loathe you she cried she listened apprehensively for his touch on the handle of the door he would come in humming a tune to ask some idle question and lay a caress on her hair but no the door was bolted she was safe she continued to listen and the step passed on he had not been coming to her then he must have gone downstairs to fetchsomething another newspaper perhaps he seemed to read little else and she sometimes wondered when he had found time to store the material that used to serve for their famous literary talks the wonder shot through her again barbed with a sneer at that moment it seemed to her that everything he had ever done and beenwas a lie she heard the housedoor close and started up was he going out it was not his habit to leave the house in the morning she crossed the room to the window and saw him walking with a quick decided step between the budding lilacs to the gate what could have called him forth at that unwonted hour it was odd that he should not have told her the fact that she thought it odd suddenly showed her how closely their lives were interwoven shehad become a habit to him and he was fond of his habits but toher it was as if a stranger had opened the gate and gone out she wondered what he would feel if he knew that she felt that in an hour he will know she said to herself with a kind of fierce exultation and immediately she began to dramatize the scene as soon as he came in she meant to call him up to her room and hand him the letters without a word for a moment she gloated on the picture then her imagination recoiled from it she was humiliated by the thought of humiliating him she wanted to keephis image intact she would not see him he had lied to her about her letters had lied to her when he found it to his interest to regain her favor yes there was thepoint to hold fast he had sought her out when he learned that she was rich perhaps he had come back from america on purpose to marry her no doubt he had come back on purpose it was incredible that she had not seen this at the time she turned sick at the thought of her fatuity and of the grossness of his arts well the event proved that they were all heneeded but why had he gone out at such an hour she was irritated to find herself still preoccupied by his comings and goings turning from the window she sat down again she wondered what she meant to do next no she would not show him the letters she would simply leave them on his table and go away she would leave the house with her boy and andora it was a relief to feela definite plan forming itself in her mind something that her uprooted thoughts could fasten on she would go away of course and meanwhile in order not to see him she would feign a headache and remain in her room till after luncheon then she and andora would pack a few things and fly with the child while he was dawdling about upstairs in the studio when ones house fell one fled from the ruins nothing could be simpler more inevitable her thoughts were checked by the impossibility of picturing what would happen next try as she would she could not see herself and the child away from deering but that of course was because of her nervous weakness she had youth money energy all the trumps were on her side it was much more difficult to imagine what would become of deering he was so dependent on her and they had been so happy together the fact struck her as illogical and even immoral and yet she knew he had been happy with her it never happened like that in novels happiness built on a lie always crumbled and buried the presumptuous architect beneath the ruins according to the laws of every novel she had ever read deering having deceived her once would inevitably have gone on deceiving her yet she knew he had not gone on deceiving her she tried again to picture her new life her friends of course would rally about her but the prospect left her cold she did not want them to rally she wanted only one thing the life she had been living before she had given her baby the embroideredbag to play with oh why had she given him the bag she had been so happy they had all been so happy every nerve in her clamored for her lost happiness angrily unreasonably as the boy had clamored for his bag it was horrible to know too much there was always blood in the foundations parents kept things from children protected them from all the dark secrets of pain and evil and was any life livable unless it were thus protected could any one look in the medusas face and live but why should she leave the house since it was hers here with her boy and andora she could still make for herself the semblance of a life it was deering who would have to go he would understand that as soon as he saw the letters she pictured him in the act of going leaving the house as he had left it just now she saw the gate closing on him for the last time now her vision was acute enough she saw him as distinctlyas if he were in the room ah he would not like returning to the old life of privations and expedients and yet she knew he wouldnot plead with her suddenly a new thought rushed through her mind what if andora had rushed to him with the tale of the discovery of the letters with the fly you are discovered of romantic fiction what if he had left her for good it would not be unlikehim after all under his wonderful gentleness he was always evasive and inscrutable he might have said to himself that he would forestall her action and place himself at once on the defensive it might be that she had seen him go out of the gate forthe last time she looked about the room again as if this thought had given it a new aspect yes this alone could explain her husbands going out it was past twelve oclock their usual luncheon hour and he was scrupulously punctual at meals and gently reproachful if shekept him waiting only some unwonted event could have caused himto leave the house at such an hour and with such marks of haste well perhaps it was better that andora should have spoken she mistrusted her own courage she almost hoped the deed had been done for her yet her next sensation was one of confused resentment she said to herself why has andora interfered she felt baffled and angry as though her prey had escaped her if deering had been in the house she would have gone to him instantly and overwhelmed him with her scorn but he had gone out and she did not know where he had gone and oddly mingled with her anger against him was the latent instinct of vigilance thesolicitude of the woman accustomed to watch over the man she loves it would be strange never to feel that solicitude again never to hear him say with his hand on her hair why you foolish child were you worried am i late the sense of his touch was so real that she stiffened herself against it flinging back her head as if to throw off his hand the mere thought of his caress was hateful yet she felt it in all her traitorous veins yes she felt it but with horror and repugnance it was something she wanted to escape from and the fact of struggling against it was what made its hold so strong it was as though her mind were sounding her body to make sure of itsallegiance spying on it for any secret movement of revolt to escape from the sensation she rose and went again to thewindow no one was in sight but presently the gate began to swing back and her heart gave a leap she knew not whether up ordown a moment later the gate opened slowly to admit a perambulator propelled by the nurse and flanked by juliet and andora lizzies eyes rested on the familiar group as if she hadnever seen it before and she stood motionless instead of flyingdown to meet the children suddenly there was a step on the stairs and she heard andoras agitated knock she unbolted the door and was strainedto her friends emaciated bosom my darling miss macy cried remember you have your child and me lizzie loosened herself gently she looked at andora with afeeling of estrangement which she could not explain have you spoken to my husband she asked drawing coldly back spoken to him no andora stared at her in genuine wonder then you havent met him since he left me no my love is he out i havent met him lizzie sat down with a confused sense of relief which welled up to her throat and made speech difficult suddenly light came to andora i understand dearest youdont feel able to see him yourself you want me to go to him for you she looked about her scenting the battle youre right darling as soon as he comes in ill go to him the sooner we get it over the better she followed lizzie who without answering her had turned mechanically back to the window as they stood there the gate moved again and deering entered the garden there he is now lizzie felt andoras fervent clutch uponher arm where are the letters i will go down at once you allow me to speak for you you trust my womans heart oh believe me darling miss macy panted i shall know just what to say to him what to say to him lizzie absently repeated as her husband advanced up the path she had a sudden trembling vision of their three years together those years were her wholelife everything before them had been colorless and unconscious like the blind life of the plant before it reaches the surface ofthe soil they had not been exactly what she dreamed but if they had taken away certain illusions they had left richer realities in their stead she understood now that she had gradually adjusted herself to the new image of her husband as he was as he would always be he was not the hero of her dream but he was the man she loved and who had loved her for she saw now in this last wide flash of pity and initiation that as a solid marble may bemade out of worthless scraps of mortar glass and pebbles so outof mean mixed substances may be fashioned a love that will bear the stress of life more urgently she felt the pressure of miss macys hand i shall hand him the letters without a word you may rely love on my sense of dignity i know everything youre feeling at this moment deering had reached the doorstep lizzie continued to watch him in silence till he disappeared under the glazed roof of the porch below the window then she turned and looked almost compassionately at her friend oh poor andora you dont know anything you dont know anything at all she said the end
