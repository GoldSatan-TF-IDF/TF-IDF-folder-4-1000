if youre afraid of bees i have to warn you there are a lot of bees in this story in fact there are hundreds up until last month i was afraid of bees and when you read this story youll see why it all started in july when i heard a frightening buzz the buzz of a bee i sat up straight and searched all around but i couldnt see any bees anywhere the scary buzzing sound just wouldnt stop in fact it seemed to be getting louder its probably andretti again i told myself ruining my day as usual id been reading a stack of comic books under the big maple tree in my back yard other kids might have better things to do on a hot sticky summer afternoon like maybe going to the pool with their friends but riot me my name is gary lutz and i have to be honest i dont have many real close friends even my nineyearold sister krissy doesnt like me very much my life is the pits why is that i constantly ask myself what exactly is wrong with me why do all the kids call me names like lutz the klutz why does everybody always make fun of me sometimes i think it might be because of the way i look that morning id spent a long time studying myself in the mirror id stared at myself for at least half an hour i saw a long skinny face a mediumsized nose and straight blond hair not exactly handsome but not terrible bzzzzzz i cant stand that sound and it was coming even closer i flopped over on my stomach then i peered around the side of the maple tree i wanted to get a better view of my neighbors yard oh no i thought i was right the buzzing sound was coming from mr andrettis bees my neighbor was at it again he was always hanging out in the back by his garage messing with those bees of his how could he handle them every day without worrying about getting stung i asked myself didnt they give him the creeps i climbed to my knees and edged a few inches forward even though i wanted to get a better look at mr andretti i didnt want him to see me the last time he caught me watching him he made a big deal out of it he acted as if there were some kind of law against sitting outside in your own back yard whats this he bellowed at the top of his lungs did someone start a neighborhood watch committee without informing me or is the fbi recruiting tenyearold spies these days this last remark really steamed me because mr andretti knows perfectly well that im twelve years old after all my family has lived next door to him for my entire life which is bad luck for me mainly since im afraid of bees i might as well confess it right away im scared of a few other things too such as dogs big mean kids the dark loud noises and swimming in the ocean im even scared of claus thats krissys dumb cat but most of all im scared of bees unfortunately with a beekeeper for a neighbor there are always bees around hairy crawly buzzing stinging bees meow i jumped up as claus the cat came creeping up behind me why do you have to stalk me like that i cried as i spoke claus moved forward and wrapped himself around my leg then he dug his long needlesharp claws into my skin ouch i screamed get away from me i cannot understand how krissy can love that creature so much she says he only jumps on me because he likes me well all i can say is that i dont like him and i wish he would keep away from me when i finally managed to chase claus away i went back to studying my neighbor yes im scared of bees and im fascinated by them too i cant seem to stop watching mr andretti all the time at least he keeps his hives in a screenedin area behind his garage that makes me feel pretty safe and he acts as if he knows what hes doing in fact he acts as if hes the worlds greatest living expert on bees today mr andretti was wearing his usual bee outfit its a white suit and a hat with a wirescreen veil hanging down to protect his face his clothes are tied with string at the wrists and ankles he looks just like some kind of alien creature out of a horror movie as my neighbor carefully opened and closed the drawerlike sections of his hanging hives i noticed he wasnt wearing any gloves once when i was with my dad mr andretti had explained this to us its like this lutz he said lutz is my father ken lutz naturally during this entire conversation mr andretti had acted as if i wasnt even there tour average beekeepers usually wear gloves he explained a lot of the brave ones use gloves with no fingers and thumbs so they can work with the bees more easily mr andretti thumped himself on the chest and went on but your truly outstanding beekeeper such as myself likes to work with his bare hands my bees trust me you know lutz bees are really a lot smarter than most people realize oh sure i said to myself at the time if theyre really so smart why do they keep coming back to your hive and letting you steal all their honey from them bzzzzzz the humming from mr andrettis hives suddenly grew louder and more threatening i stood up and walked over to the fence between our two back yards i gazed into the screenedin area to see what was going on then i gasped out loud mr andrettis white suit didnt appear white anymore it had become black why because he was totally covered with bees as i stared more and more of the insects oozed out of their hives they crawled all over mr andrettis arms and chest and even on his head i was so grossed out i thought i might puke mr andrettis hat and veil shimmered and bulged as if they were alive wasnt he scared of all those stingers as i leaned over the fence andretti suddenly yelled at me gary look out i froze huh the bees mr andretti screamed theyre out of control run i never ran so fast in my life i charged across the yard and stumbled up the back steps of my house i flung open the screen door and almost fell into the house then i stopped and leaned against the kitchen table gasping for air when i finally caught my breath i listened hard i could still hear the angry buzzing of the bees from the next yard then i heard something else haw haw haw somebody was laughing out there and it sounded suspiciously like mr andretti slowly i turned around and peered out through the screen door my neighbor was standing at the bottom of the back steps hed taken off his bee veil and i could see that he had a huge grin on his face haw haw you should have seen the expression on your face gary you never would believe how funny you looked and the way you ran i stared at him you mean your bees werent escaping mr andretti slapped his knee of course they werent i have complete control of those bees at all times they come and go bringing nectar and pollen back from the flowers he paused to wipe some sweat off his forehead of course sometimes i have to go out and recapture a few lost bees with my net but most of them know my hives are really the best home they can possibly have so this was all a joke mr andretti i tried to sound angry but thats hard to do when your voice is shaking even harder than your knees it was supposed to be funny i guess thatll teach you to get a life and stop staring at me all day he replied then he turned and walked away i was so angry what a mean trick it was bad enough having kids my age pick on me all the time but now the grownups were starting in i pounded my fist on the kitchen table just as my mother walked into the room hi gary she said frowning try not to destroy the furniture okay i was just about to make myself a sandwich would you like one i guess so i muttered sitting down at the table would you like the usual i nodded the usual was peanut butter and jelly which i never get tired of for a snack i usually like taco chips the spicier the better as i waited for my sandwich i ripped open a new bag of chips and started chewing away uhoh mom was rummaging through the refrigerator im afraid were out of jelly guess well have to use something else she pulled out a small glass jar how about this with your peanut butter what is it i asked honey honey i shrieked no way later i was feeling lonely i wandered over to the school playground as i walked by the swing set i saw a bunch of kids i knew from school they were standing around on the softball diamond choosing up sides for a game i joined them maybe just maybe theyd let me play gail and i are captains a boy named louie was saying i walked over and stood at the edge of the group i was just in time one by one louie and gail picked players for their teams every kid was chosen every kid except one that is i was left standing by myself next to home plate as i slumped my shoulders and stared down at the ground the captains starting fighting over me you take him gail louie said no you take him no fair i always get stuck with lutz as the two captains argued over who was going to be stuck with me i could feel my face getting redder and redder i wanted to leave but then they all would have said i was a quitter finally gail sighed and rolled her eyes oh all right she said well take him but remember the special lutz rule he gets four strikes before hes out i swallowed hard and followed my teammates out onto the diamond at that point luck was with me gail sent me to the outfield go way out in right lutz gail ordered by the back fence nobody ever hits it out there some kids might be angry about being stuck so far away from the action but i was grateful if no balls were hit to me i wouldnt have a chance to drop them the way i always did as i watched the game my stomach slowly tied itself into a tight knot i was last in the batting order but when my turn at the plate finally came around the bases were loaded i picked up the bat and wandered out toward the plate a groan rose up from my teammates lutz is up somebody cried in disbelief easy out yelled the girl playing first base no batter nobatter no batter everyone on the other team hooted and laughed out of the corner of my eye i saw gail put her face in her hands i ground my teeth together and started praying please let me get a walk please let me get a walk i knew i could never hit the ball so a walk was my one and only hope of course i struck out four straight strikes lutz the klutz i heard someone cry then a lot of kids laughed without looking back i marched off the baseball diamond and away from the playground i was heading home toward the peace and quiet of my own room it might not be perfect i thought but at least at home no one teased me about being a klutz hey look guys a voice shouted as i turned onto my street hey wow its lutz the klutz someone else answered lookin good dude i couldnt believe my bad luck the three voices belonged to the biggest meanest toughest creeps in the entire neighborhood barry marv and karl theyre my age but at least five times as big these guys are gorillas i mean their knuckles drag on the sidewalk and when theyre not swinging back and forth on a tire swing in their gorilla cage whats their favorite activity you guessed it beating me up give me a break guys i pleaded im having a bad day they laughed you want a break lutz one of them shouted menacingly here i only had time to blink as i watched a huge meanlooking fist heading right for my nose a long painful ten minutes later i walked through the back door of my house fortunately my mom was somewhere upstairs she didnt see my bloody nose scratched bruised arms and torn shirt all i needed was for her to start fussing over me and threatening to call the other boys parents if that happened barry marv and karl really would kill me the next time they saw me as i crept up the stairs claus the cat came leaping out at me yowl whoooooa i was so shocked i almost fell back down the stairs get away from me you monster i pushed the cat away and hurried down the hall to the bathroom i gazed into the mirror and almost heaved i looked like road kill i rinsed off my nose with icecold water then i cleaned off all the blood and staggered to my room i took off my rippedup tshirt and hid it behind my bed then i put on a winter shirt with long sleeves it would be hot but it would hide my scratched arms downstairs in the kitchen i found mom and krissy mom was getting out mixing bowls and eggs and krissy was tying a big apron around her waist as usual claus was purring and wrapping himself around krissys legs why did he act like such an innocent little kitten around her and such a monster around me hi gary my mom said to me you want to help us make peanut butter cookies no thanks i said but ill lick the bowl for you later i walked over to the table and picked up the bag of taco chips id left there before well at least you can help by getting that new jar of peanut butter out of the cupboard and opening it for me mom said this recipe calls for a lot of peanut butter sounds good i said just so long as it doesnt have any honey in it i opened the cupboard door and took out the peanut butter i tried to twist off the cap i twisted as hard as i could but the top just wouldnt move i banged the jar on the countertop and tried again still no luck do you have a wrench or something around mom i asked this thing just wont budge maybe if you ran hot water on it my mother began oh puhlease krissy said with a snort wiping her hands on her apron she crossed the room and grabbed the jar away from me with two fingers she twisted off the cap then she started laughing her head off my mom started laughing too can you believe it my own mother was laughing at me i guess you forgot to eat your oat bran this morning mom said im leaving i muttered to mom and krissy forever the two of them were laughing together i dont think they even heard me totally miserable i stepped out the front door and slammed it hard behind me i decided to ride my bike around the block a few times when i went around to the side of the house and got it out of the garage i started to cheer up a little bit my bike is really awesome its a new blue twentyone speed and its real sleek and cool my dad gave it to me for my twelfth birthday i jumped on my bike and headed down the driveway as i turned onto the street i saw some girls walking down the sidewalk out of the corner of my eye i recognized them wow i thought its judy dormer and kaitlyn davis both judy and kaitlyn go to my school theyre really pretty and very popular to be honest ive had a major crush on judy since the fourth grade and once at the fifthgrade picnic she actually smiled at me at least i think it was at me so when i saw those girls walking down the street i decided it was a good time to try to be really cool i flipped my baseball cap around so the brim was at the back of my head then i folded my arms across my chest and started pedaling nohanded as i passed them i glanced over my shoulder and flashed my most glamorous smile at judy and kaitlyn before my beautiful smile faded i felt a tug at my sneaker i realized instantly that my shoelace was caught in the chain a horrible grinding sound filled the air the bike jerked and lurched from side to side and i lost control gary i heard judy shriek gary look out for that car craaaaaaack i didnt see the lamppost until i hit it as i toppled off my bike and shot sideways through the air i heard the sound of metal crumpling ripping and shredding i landed on my face in a deep warm puddle of mud i heard the car rumble past me slowly i pulled my face out of the mud guess i didnt look too cool i thought bitterly maybe at least ill get a little sympathy no way i could hear judy and kaitlyn laughing behind me on the sidewalk nice bike gary one of them called they hurried away i had never been so humiliated in all my life if i could have i would have put down roots in that mud puddle and turned myself into a tree it might not be the most exciting life in the world but at least no one laughs at a tree im serious at that moment i would have happily traded lives with a tree or a bird or a bug or just about any other living object on the planet with that sad thought i decided to get myself up and out of there before anyone else came along it took all my strength to peel my wrecked bicycle off the lamppost luckily i didnt have far to drag it for the second time in the same afternoon i crept into my house and up the stairs so i could get cleaned up before anyone saw me now as i studied my reflection in the bathroom mirror i saw there was no way i could hide all my cuts and scrapes from my mom oh who cares i moaned as i washed the mud off my face and hands who cares if mom sees them ill be doing her a favor by giving her something else to laugh at itll really make her day i went back into my room and changed into my last clean shirt then i glanced around trying to find something to do i decided to boot up my computer playing with my computer is one of the few things i really like when im lost in the world of a computer game sometimes i can actually forget im a total jerk named gary lutz nobody in a computer game ever calls me lutz the klutz i turned on the computer and decided to have another try at the planet monstro fantasy game id been stuck on for two days monstro is a really cod game when you play it youre a character named the warrior and youre trapped on the planet monstro you have to get yourself out of all kinds of scary situations before i started to play i thought id check computa note one of the electronic bulletin boards im connected to on the computer id left a message there on monday asking if anyone knew how to defeat the twoheaded dragon that kept eating me on the thirteenth moon of monstro sometimes other people in the country who are playing the same game will send each other hints when i accessed computa note i saw the following computergamerelated messages on the screen to arnold in milwaukee have you tried rubbing smashedup eucalyptus leaves all over yourself in the rain forest game its an ecologically correct way of repelling the poisonous ants in ecoscare from lisa in san francisco to r from sacramento the only way to escape from the flood on your spaceship in spacequest is to inflate your suit and float away from l in st louis to gary in millville try stabbing the dragon between the eyes it worked for me from ted in ithaca oh terrific i thought id been trying to stab the dragon between the eyes but the creature always ate me before i could do it what was ted in ithaca doing that i wasnt i decided to leave another electronic note asking ted to explain what he meant but as i started typing i noticed another message at the very bottom of the computer screen i read it then i read it again very carefully take a vacation from yourself change places with someone for a week what could that mean i pressed the enter button so i could read what was next i desperately wanted more information about the message this is what i saw take a vacation from yourself change places with someone for a week persontoperson vacations roach street suite b or call swap how could it possibly work i asked myself how could two people change lives without getting into all kinds of trouble i had to admit it sounded totally crazy crazy but interesting i yawned and scratched the back of my head ouch my hand grazed one of the painful bumps id gotten from barry marv and karl it really hurt but the stab of pain helped me make up my mind i was definitely ready for some changes in my life i dont want to spend the rest of my life getting beat up i told myself or crashing into lampposts either or being the last person chosen for the team i took out a piece of paper and copied the address from the screen as i did i realized it was only a few blocks from my school i knew just where it was i could stop by the persontoperson office the next day im really going to check it out i decided making up my mind like that improved my mood a lot i was beginning to feel almost cheerful when i went back downstairs but not for long when my family sat down in the dining room for dinner my father noticed my bangedup face gary he exclaimed what in the world happened to you er i said i had a little accident on my bike i winced as i said the word bike i was thinking about the mangled wreck in the corner of the garage i dont believe that for a minute mom said im sure youve been fighting with those big kids in the neighborhood again why in the world cant you children learn to settle your disagreements peacefully krissy started laughing so hard she almost choked on her tuna casserole gary doesnt have any disagreements with those guys mom she said they just like to beat him up my mother shook her head angrily well i think thats just outrageous she said i have a good mind to call those boys parents up right now and give them a piece of my mind i groaned loudly im telling you mom i really had an accident with my bike if you dont believe me go check it out in the garage then my father did believe me he started lecturing me about bike safety and why i should have been wearing my helmet and how i was going to have to pay to have the bike fixed with my own money after a while i stopped paying much attention as i pushed my casserole around on my plate all i could think about was my plan for changing my life with persontoperson vacations the sooner the better i thought the sooner i get out of this life the better off ill be we finished dinner and i went upstairs to play on my computer again i spent the rest of the evening with my planet monstro game i kept trying to stab the dragon between the eyes but even though i followed ted from ithacas advice i couldnt do it the dragon ate me twentythree times finally i gave up and crawled into bed i was so wiped out i started drifting off to sleep almost right away i turned over and pulled the blanket up under my chin i curled up into a ball the toes on my right foot touched something huh i said out loud what is that down there my heart pounded in my chest slowly i moved my toes again ohhhhhh my blood turned into ice i jumped out of bed and let out a bloodcurdling scream frantically i ripped the blankets off my bed in the dim light coming in through the window i could see the rat fat and hairy its red eyes gleaming at me i screamed again then i heard laughter down the hall krissys laughter my stomach sank i made my way to the switch and turned on the light sure enough the rat still stared at me from my bed but now i recognized it a gray rubber rat one of clauss favorite toys in her room down the hall krissy squealed with laughter im going to get you you little brat i screamed i thought about going down the hall and really thumping her but i quickly decided against it even though krissy is only nine she happens to be pretty strong there was an excellent chance she could beat me up with an angry growl i grabbed the rat off my bed and heaved it into the corner of my room then my heart still pounding with rage i turned off the light and climbed back under the covers tomorrow i promised myself in the dark room tomorrow you gary lutz are going to check out that ad and find out if you can change your life even if its only for a week it has to be better than this miserable life you have now the next day i kept my promise to myself after breakfast i walked the six blocks to roach street and started reading the street numbers trying to find number i guess i was looking for some kind of big glass office building but when i finally found number it was on a small gray building that looked something like my dentists office a little sign on the outside read persontoperson vacations suite b i opened the door and walked up a flight of steps at the top i opened another door and went into a kind of waiting room with beige carpeting and tan leather chairs a darkhaired woman sat behind a big glass window she smiled at me when i came in and i walked over to talk to her good afternoon she said into a microphone i jumped even though the woman was right in front of me her voice came out through a speaker on the wall uh um i stammered nervously i came about the message on the electronic bulletin board oh yes the woman replied with another smile a lot of people learn about us from their computers pardon me for staying behind this glass shield but the equipment behind me is so delicate we have to be very careful about protecting it i peered over the womans shoulder i could see gleaming metal counters and a wall of electronic equipment including what appeared to be heart monitors video screens xray machines and cameras it looked like something right out of star trek i suddenly had a heavy feeling in my stomach maybe this is a bad idea i thought yyou probably dont like kids hanging around in here i stammered i started backing away toward the door not true she said many of our customers are young people such as you a lot of kids are interested in changing places with someone else for a week what did you say your name was gary gary lutz nice to meet you gary my name is ms karmen how old are you about twelve i nodded come over here for a minute ms karmen said motioning with her hand cautiously i walked back over to the glass booth she opened a little slot at the bottom of her window and pushed out a book i picked it up and saw that it was a photo album like the one my parents have from their wedding i opened it and started looking through it its kids i exclaimed all about my age correct said ms karmen theyre all interested in switching lives with someone else for a week wow i studied the album a lot of the kids in the pictures looked big and strong and cool kids like that wouldnt be afraid of anything i told myself i wondered what it would be like to be one of them you can pick a boy or even a girl for that matter to trade places with for a week ms karmen was saying but how does it work i asked do i just go take over somebodys room and live in his house for a week go to his school wear his clothes the woman laughed its far more interesting than that gary with our getaway vacations you actually become tine other person for a week huh what we have the woman explained is a safe painless way to switch one persons mind into another persons body so while youll know youre really you no one else will recognize you not even the other boys parents i was still confused but what about my body does it get stored here no no we here at persontoperson will find someone else to take over your body for the week your parents will never even know youre gone i looked down at my skinny body and wondered who could possibly want to borrow it for a week ms karmen leaned forward in her chair so what do you say are you interested gary i stared into her dark brown eyes and swallowed hard i broke into a cold sweat this whole thing was really weird and scary uh i said i dont know i mean im just not sure dont feel bad ms karmen said many people take some time to get used to the idea of a body switch you can think it over for as long as you wish she took out a small camera but in the meantime would you mind if i took your picture that way we can find out if anyone is interested in being in your body for a week well i guess its okay i replied she snapped the picture and the flash went off in front of my eyes but im still not sure i want to go through with it theres no obligation ms karmen said why dont we leave it this way you fill out a form describing yourself then ill put your picture into our display album and when we find someone to take your place ill call you to see if youve made up your mind okay i replied what harm could that do i asked myself there was no way she would ever find anybody whod want my body for a week i spent a few minutes filling out the form i had to write down my name and address then i had to tell all about my hobbies and how well i did in school and things like that when i was finished i handed it to ms karmen said goodbye and headed out the door made it most of the way home without getting into trouble a block and a half from my house i ran into my three most unfavorite people in the world barry marv and karl hey guys barry cried with an ugly smile the klutz is up and walking around that must mean we didnt do a very good job of pounding him yesterday no i insisted you did a good job you did a very good job guys i guess they didnt believe me they all jumped me at once when they were finally finished about five minutes later i lay on the ground and watched them walk away through one swollen black eye have a nice day marv called back to me all three of them roared with laughter i sat up and pounded the ground with my fist im sick of this i wailed i want to be somebody else anybody else slowly and painfully i dragged myself to my feet im doing it i decided and nobodys going to stop me tomorrow fm going to call persontoperson vacations i want them to put me into somebody elses body as soon as they can i spent the next few days changing my bandaids and hoping the woman from persontoperson vacations would call me at first i ran to answer the phone every time it rang but of course it was never for me usually it was one of krissys dumb friends wanting to giggle and gossip one afternoon i was reading a sciencefiction book in my usual spot behind the big maple tree i heard a sound and peered around from behind the tree sure enough there was mr andretti walking across the lawn he was dressed in his beekeeping outfit as i watched mr andretti went to the screenedin area off the garageand started opening up the little doors to his beehives bzzzzzz i covered my ears but i couldnt shut out the loud droning hum how i hated that sound it was just so frightening i shivered and decided it was time to go back inside as i climbed to my feet a bulletsized object shot right by my nose a bee were the bees escaping for real this time i gasped and stared over at andrettis house then i almost choked there was a big hole in the screen around the beekeeping area a lot of bees were flying out ow i cried out as a bee landed on the side of my head and buzzed loudly into my ear frantically i batted it away then i ran toward the house for one wild moment i thought about calling the police or maybe the paramedics but as i slammed the back door i heard an alltoofamiliar sound haw haw haw once again mr andretti was laughing at me i pounded my fist into my other hand oh how id like to sock that guy in the nose i thought i was interrupted by the sound of the phone ringing give me a break i cried as i stomped off to answer it dont krissys moron friends have anything better to do than talk on the phone all day long whaddya want i snarled into the mouthpiece is this gary a womans voice asked gary lutz uh yes i answered in surprise im gary hi gary this is ms karmen from persontoperson vacations remember me my heart started thumping in my chest yes i remember i answered well if youre still interested weve found a match for you a match correct said ms karmen weve found a boy who wants to switch bodies with you for a week are you interested i hesitated for a few seconds but then as i gazed out the back door of the kitchen i saw a big fat bee throwing itself against the outside of our screen door haw haw mr andrettis scornful laughter boomed across the back yard my mouth tightened into a thin line yes i said firmly im really interested when can we make the switch why we could do it now said ms karmen if thats all right with you my pulse raced as i thought my parents were both out for the afternoon and krissy was playing at a friends house the timing was perfect id never get another chance like this now is great i exclaimed terrific gary it will take me about twenty minutes to get to your house ill be waiting the next twenty minutes seemed to take forever while i waited i paced back and forth in the living room wondering what my new body would be like what would my new parents be like my house my clothes would i actually have some friends this time around by the time ms karmen arrived i was a wreck when the doorbell rang my hand was sweating so much i could barely turn the doorknob to let her in lets go in the kitchen ms karmen suggested i like to set up my equipment on a table she opened a small case and took out some black boxes with monitors on them i showed her the way to the kitchen so whos this kid who wants to switch places with me i asked his name is dirk davis dirk davis i thought excitedly even his name sounded cool what does he look like ms karmen opened up a white photo album heres his picture she said passing it to me i looked down at a picture of a tall athleticlooking blond boy in black lycra bike shorts and a blue muscle shirt i blinked in surprise he looks like a surfer or something i cried why in the world does he want to switch bodies with me is this some kind of trick ms karmen smiled well to be honest its not exactly your body hes interested in gary he wants your mind you see dirk needs someone who is good in math he has some very hard math tests coming up in summer school he wants you to take them for him oh i said i felt relieved well i usually do pretty well on math tests we know that gary persontoperson does its homework youre very good at math dirks good at skateboarding i sat down at the table bzzzzzz a bee buzzed right under my nose hey i yelled jumping back up howd that bee get in here ms karmen glanced up from her equipment your back door is open just a bit now please sit down and try to relax i need to fasten this strap around your wrist with a nervous glance at the back door i sat back down ms karmen strapped a black band around my wrist then she started fiddling with some wires attached to one of her machines bzzzzzz another bee flew in front of me and i wiggled around in my chair please sit still gary otherwise the equipment wont work who can sit still with all these bees buzzing around in here i asked i lowered my eyes and saw three fat bees walking across the table bzzzzzz another bee flew past my right eye whats up with these bees i was starting to panic dont pay any attention to them ms karmen said and they wont bother you she made one more adjustment to her machine besides dirk davis isnt afraid of bees and as soon as i flip this switch you wont be either but zzaaaapppp a blinding white light flashed in front of my eyes i tried to cry out but my breath caught in my throat the light grew brighter brighter and then i sank into a deep pool of blackness something was wrong colors returned but they were a total blur i struggled to make everything come clear but i couldnt seem to focus on anything my new body didnt feel right either i was lying on my back and i felt light as a feather light enough to float away could this be dirk daviss tall muscular body it certainly didnt feel like it was this some kind of trick i asked myself was the picture of dirk davis a phony was he really a lot smaller than he looked in the photo album i reached out one of my hands and tried to touch my stomach but my hand felt really weird too it was small and my arm seemed to be bending in several places at once whats going on i wondered trembling with fright why do i feel so weird whooooa i cried out as i finally managed to touch my body yuck my skin was soft and it was covered with a fine layer of fuzz help ms karmen help somethings wrong i tried to shout but there was something wrong with my voice it came out all tiny and squeaky little mouse squeaks i rolled over onto my stomach and tried to get up i spread my arms to balance myself i gasped as i realized my feet werent even touching the ground i was flying whats happening to me i cried in my squeaky little voice i floated forward and crashed into a kitchen cupboard ow help me i moved my strange new arms and realized i had some control over which way i flew i felt some weird muscles in my back going into action testing my new muscles i flew over to the kitchen window exhausted i landed on the sill i turned my head to one side then i gasped in fright a hideous monster was reflected in the window glass the creature had two huge glaring eyes and it was staring right at me i tried to scream but i was too terrified to utter a sound i i have to get away i decided i moved my feet and started to run the monster in the glass ran too i stopped and stared at the window glass the monster stopped and stared back at me oh no please no i cried please dont let it be true i reached up and tried to cover my eyes the creature in the window did the same thing and suddenly i knew the hideous truth the monster in the mirror it was me ms karmen had messed up totally and now i was trapped inside the body of a bee i dont know how long i stood there i couldnt stop staring at my reflection i kept waiting to come out of this nightmare i kept waiting to blink my eyes and find myself in dirk daviss big muscular body but i didnt look at all like dirk davis i had two giant eyes one on either side of my head and two skinny little antennas sticking out of my forehead my mouth was truly disgusting i had some kind of long tongue which i soon discovered i could move all around and make longer and shorter if i wanted which i didnt my body was covered with thick black hair i had three legs on either side of my body and lets not forget the wings sticking out of my shoulders this is the pits i cried im a bug im a disgusting hairy bug ms karmen something went wrong help me creeeeak slam what was that oh no i realized that ms karmen had just gone out the kitchen door no wait wait i squeaked she was my only hope i had to catch her i had to tell her what had happened ms karmen i squeaked ms karmen frantically i flew out of the kitchen into the living room out the window i could see her car still parked out in front of the house but the front door to the outside was shut and bees cant open doors i was trapped inside my own house the back door i remembered ms karmen had said it was open just a bit yes that was how all those bees got into the house in the first place i fluttered my new wings and flew back into the kitchen as i soared i realized i was getting more and more control over my flight pattern but i didnt care about that right now all i knew was that i had to get to ms karmen before she drove away i darted out the tiny opening in the back door ms karmen i shouted as i flew around the side of the house ms karmen help me you messed up im a bee help me my voice was so tiny she couldnt hear me she opened her car door and started to climb behind the wheel my only chance for a normal life was about to drive away what could i do how could i get her attention thinking quickly i flew right toward her head ms karmen i shouted in her ear its me gary ms karmen uttered a startled cry then she drew back her hand and swatted me hard ow my entire body vibrated with pain the force of her swat sent me falling to the street i hit the pavement with a painful splat i shook my head trying to clear my eyes thats when i realized i had an extra set of tiny eyes arranged in a kind of triangle on the top of my head i used them to gaze straight up and then i screamed in terror i saw the tire rolling toward me ms karmen was about to drive right over me i was about to be squashed like the bug that i was oh i froze in panic even with my blurred bee vision i could see the deep treads in the tire as it rolled steadily toward me closer closer i have to move i told myself fly away fly away but in my panic i forgot how to use my new muscles i im going to be squashed i realized i uttered a final weak cry and the car stopped huh my entire body was trembling but somehow i managed to pull myself up up into the air yes i was flying now i could see ms karmen inside the car she was fastening her seat belt she had stopped the car to put on her seat belt hey seat belts really do save lives i told myself i called out to her but of course she couldnt hear me i watched the car roll away until it was a blur of color then exhausted and terrified i buzzed over to a nearby lilac bush and dropped onto a leaf that was too close i told myself in between gasps for air im going to get killed out here a green caterpillar inched its way up onto a nearby stem and started chewing noisily on the leaf i was resting on id never really examined a caterpillar before up close theyre real ugly they look a little bit like dragons only scarier keep away from me i yelled in my tiny voice the caterpillar didnt even turn its head maybe it didnt hear me i forgot all about the caterpillar when i heard footsteps coming up the front walk i turned my head and used my sideways eye to see who it was mom i screamed mom over here she couldnt hear me she hurried up the steps and into the house suddenly i was overcome by a wave of sadness my own mother didnt recognize me desperately i fluttered my wings and flew away from the leaf i made my way to the front of the house and started buzzing around the front windows i had my wings under complete control by now but the scene i saw inside the house was enough to make me fall down onto the ground again my mother stood in the living room talking to me or at least thats what she thought only i knew it couldnt be me was stuck outside but who wets in there with my mom had dirk davis managed to get inside my body i landed on the ledge and stared into the house my mom was talking the boy was nodding and laughing he said something to her if i stared closely i could read his lips hey did you buy taco chips im really starving mom that had to be dirk talking inside my body my mom smiled at him and patted him on the arm i read his lips and saw that he was calling her mom again how could he do that how could he call my mother mom if bees could cry which i now know they cant i would have started bawling right then and there who did that boy think he was for that matter what kind of mom did i have who couldnt even tell that a total stranger was living inside her sons body as i watched myself and my mom chatting in the living room i totally lost it like a crazed maniac i started bashing my insect body into the window buzz i cried buzz buzz buzz its me gary look out here help me again and again i smashed myself up against the glass but no one inside the house noticed after a few minutes mom brought the new me a bag of taco chips i watched gary rip the bag open and take out a handful of chips crumbs fell on the living room carpet as he crunched the spicy chips i realized i was starving but what do bees eat i asked myself desperately i tried to remember everything id ever read about the creatures i thought of the hungry caterpillar crunching away on the leaf but i was almost positive bees didnt eat leaves but what did they eat other bugs ugh the thought made me shudder id die before id eat a bug i buzzed around the yard hoping to see something anything i could use for food as i flew i found that i was getting used to my strange new vision and learning how to work my different sets of eyes i remembered something id once read in an old picture book called the big book of bees it said that bee eyes each have thousands of tiny lenses crowded together but because they dont have pupils they cant really focus their eyes interesting i thought but not very helpful if i could remember about bees eyesight why couldnt i remember what they ate i settled onto another bush to think and suddenly i became aware of a wonderful odor nearby i turned my head and saw a beautiful yellow flower then i remembered something else id read pollen i said out loud bees eat pollen and they get it from flowers excitedly i flew up into the air and started hovering over the yellow blossom i tried to open my mouth before i remembered i didnt have that kind of mouth anymore instead i had my long weird tongue but how was i supposed to use it to get the stuff out of the flower i didnt have a clue as i hummed around in the air i realized i was becoming more and more exhausted if i didnt get something to eat soon i was going to faint i started to feel dizzy i hardly knew where i was i became more and more confused my brain got so fuzzy i even began to wonder if id ever actually been a boy at all maybe id really been a bee for my entire life and id just dreamed about being a boy slam somebody dosed a car door nearby and i was startled out of my mental fog i swiveled my head to look dad he was closing the garage door now he was walking across the driveway and heading toward the back door of the house dad i screamed dad its me gary help me hi gary dad said dad you can hear me i cried joyfully dad youve got to help me my heart sank when dad walked right past me and started talking to the fake gary desperately i started buzzing round and round their heads looks like andrettis lost one of his workers my dad laughed he swatted at me with his rolledup newspaper a near miss i darted away uh right the fake gary laughed pretending e knew what dad was talking about andretti lets help get dinner on my dad said he put a friendly hand on my former shoulder okay son sure thing dad like best pals my dad and his phony son crossed the lawn and opened the screen door wait i shouted wait like a space rocket i shot through the air after them if i really put the speed on i thought i could make it through the door before it closed fast faster and blaml the screen door banged shut right on top of my tiny bee body once again i sank into a deep pool of blackness ohhhhhh where am i what happened am i still a bee dazed i fought my way back to the real world when i was able to get my eyes open i realized i was still a bee a small frail slightly damaged bee whod just narrowly missed being scrunched by a screen door now i was lying on my back on the grass in our yard mysix legs were thrashing the air i was a klutz as a human and im a klutz as a bee i wailed i tried to flip myself over ive only been a bee for an hour and ive almost been killed twice i suddenly knew what i had to do i had to get to ms karmens office and tell her what had happened i didnt know if i could do it but i knew i had to try i let out a small grunt and with a huge effort flipped over onto my stomach using all five of my eyes i checked myself out both sets of wings seemed to be working and all my six legs were still there okay i told myself you can do it just fly to the persontoperson office and go inside i flapped my wings and started to take off into the air but id only risen about an inch up off the ground when i heard a sound that made my blood run cold it was claus the cat with his long sharp daws extended he leaped through the air i let out a squeal as he pounced on me grabbed me in one paw and began to tighten his claws around my body as the cats claws closed around me i saw his hideous mouth gape open sting him sting him the thought burned into my mind but something held me back something told me not to use my stinger i suddenly remembered something else id read in the big book of bees honeybees die once they use their stingers no way i thought i was still hoping to come out of this alive and back in my old body so if using my stinger was out id have to use my wits instead with a loud gnashing of his teeth claus snapped his huge mouth shut he lowered his head preparing to snap up his furry prize me at just the right moment i burst out of his claws and ducked out from under his gnashing teeth i tried to shoot off through the air but the cat whipped out his paw and batted me down claus was playing with me as if i were one of the chewedup catnip mouse toys krissy always gives him for christmas with my last burst of strength i spread my wings shot up through the air and flew as fast as i could a backwards look out of one of my eyes told me that id left the surprised cat sitting in the grass for one second i experienced a wonderful sensation of triumph you did it gary i crowed to myself you a tiny little bee managed to fight off a great big vicious cat i was so pleased with myself i decided to take a little victory lap i spread my wings out wide and began a big slow circle in the air whop oh no now what id crashed right into something but what was it it wasnt hard like a wall or a tree instead it was soft and clinging like cloth and my feet were all tangled up in it i struggled to squirm free i wiggled and pushed but my legs were caught i was trapped haw haw haw the booming laughter made my entire body shake i suddenly realized where i was i was caught in andrettis net a wave of despair made me slump against the white netting i knew exactly what would happen next he would put me in his hives and i would never getaway time to go back home now my little buzzing babies mr andretti sang time to get back to work my honeys he started to laugh at his stupid pun my honeys haw haw oh my wasnt that a good one bzzzzz bzzzzzzz from the loud humming sounds in my ears i knew i wasnt the only bee andretti had caught in his net in fact out of my right eye i could see another bee who looked just like me he loomed right in front of me and wiggled his antennas in my face whooa what a monster my wiry legs began trembling with fright i twisted myself around and around struggling to get away from him i finally got myself turned the other way but then i saw i was facing another bee and another each one looked scarier than the last they all had big bulging eyes and creepy antennas and they all buzzed menacingly at me the frightening hum grew louder and louder as mr andretti caught more bees in the net suddenly the net began to shake up and down up and down like a violent earthquake until i couldnt even think straight as the net shook i lost my footing and fell into a big squirming cluster of bees at the bottom of the net whooooa i stumbled over the pile of wriggling hairy bees and as i staggered in terror bees fell on top of me a crawling buzzing nightmare ive never been so terrified i screamed in my tiny voice i tried to climb up the side of the net but my feet were stuck under another bees body how i hated the feel of his disgusting fuzz in my terror i knew i had to escape i had to get away from here i had to get to ms karmens office and beg her to help me then i had the most terrifying thought of all if i couldnt escape i suddenly realized i would remain a bee for the rest of my life as mr andretti carried me and the other bees across his back yard i started buzzing and shivering with panic how could this have happened to me i asked myself how could i ever have been so stupid as to try to change bodies with somebody else why wasnt i happy with the perfectly good body id already had mr andretti opened the door to the screenedin area off the side of his garage were back now my little honeys he cooed the net started to shake and i figured out that mr andretti was slowly turning it inside out one by one he started plucking us his prisoners off the side of the mesh cloth and plopping each one back inside his hanging drawer hives as andretti reached for the bees they started buzzing louder than ever finally it was my turn to be plucked out of the net when i saw the ends of andrettis grasping fingers reaching for me i hung back clinging to the net i suddenly remembered his bragging speech about how he never used gloves because his bees trusted him i watched his fingers stretch toward me it would be so cool to plunge my stinger into his soft plump skin i thought should i do it should i sting him should i i didnt sting him i really didnt want to die sure things really looked terrible for me right now but i was still clinging to a shred of hope maybe somehow id find my way out of this bee prison and back into my own body it didnt seem very likely but i was determined to keep on trying in you go my fuzzy little friend mr andretti said he opened up one of the removable drawerlike parts of his hive and dropped me in ohhhh i moaned it was so dark inside the hive and so confusing where should i go what should i do the air was hot and wet everywhere i turned i was surrounded by a deafening droning hum i i cant stand it i cried i could feel myself totally losing it all around me bees scurried around in the darkness i stayed where i was too frightened to move i suddenly realized i was still very hungry if i didnt get something to eat i knew id never be able to find a way out of here i spun around and started trying to explore out of my left eye i saw another bee glaring at me i froze in my tracks did bees attack each other inside their hives i wondered i didnt remember reading anything about that in my bee book but this bee really looked ready for a fight pease leave me alone i begged in my tiny voice pease give me a break the bee glared back at me ive never seen such big angrylooking eyes slowly i started backing away from him uh i squeaked nervously ive got to be going now i um i have to get to work the bee bulged his eyes and waved his antennas in a threatening way i was sure he planned to sting me i turned and flew away as fast as i could i tried to hide i was so frightened i couldnt even make myself move what if i bumped into another bee i couldnt even stand to think about what might happen if i did i realized i had to move i had to find something to eat shaking with fear i tiptoed out into the open i took a nervous look around on the far wall i could see a large duster of bees busily building something a honeycomb and where there was a honeycomb i told myself there was honey ive always hated the sweet sticky goo but i knew i had to eat some right away as quietly as i could i crept over and joined the bee workers out of the corner of my eye i saw them doing really gross things with their mouths first they used their legs to pick little flakes of waxylooking stuff off their abdomens then they crammed the wax into their mouths and started working their jaws up and down like little chewing machines finally they spit out the wax and used it to build part of the honeycomb they were working on yuck it looked so disgusting it made me sick but what choice did i have i had to eat some honey even if it was covered with bee spit i turned my head and practiced sucking my tongue up and down then i slurped up a big puddle of honey amazing for the first time in my life i actually liked that stuff soon i was sucking it down as if it were chocolate milk after a while i got quite good with my tongue which was actually more of a bendable tube than a tongue it was really the perfect tool for guzzling honey if i ever made it back to the outside world i thought id now be pretty good at using it for gathering nectar and pollen why i might turn out to be the best worker in the whole hive i tried to smile and then i almost gagged on my honey what was happening to me what was i thinking i was actually starting to feel like a bee i had to get out of this place before it was too late i wanted to start searching for an escape route right away but i suddenly felt so tired so completely worn out was it the honey or was it the strain of so much fear i could barely keep my eyes open the droning hum grew louder with a weary sigh i sank against a clump of hairy bodies i sank into the warm darkness of the hive surrounded by the steady buzz breathing the sweet aroma of the honey i sank beside my furry brothers and sisters im one of them now i told myself weakly im not a boy anymore im a bee a buzzzzzzzzzing bee a bee sinking into the warm dark hive my home sinking sinking i woke up with a start and tried to brush a bee away from my face it took me a few moments to remember i wasnt lying in my back yard anymore trying to keep the bees away from me i was a bee a bee trapped inside a hive i jumped up took a step and immediately came face to face with another bee i couldnt tell if he was the same one id seen the night before but he looked just as angry his big eyes were bulging with rage and he was moving deliberately toward me as fast as i could i spun around and flew away of course i had no idea where i was going the hive seemed to be made up of a lot of long dark hallways all around me groups of bees were building honeycombs as they worked they kept up a steady buzz the sound was really driving me off the wall i began searching for a way out i wandered in and out in and out throughout the dark sticky honeycombs from time to time i shot out my tongue and lapped up some honey i was getting a little tired of the sweet stuff but i knew i had to keep up my strength if i wanted to try to break out of the hive as i searched for a way to escape i noticed that every single bee seemed to have an assigned job either building honeycombs caring for the babies of the queen or whatever and the little bugs never stopped working they were busy as bees from morning till night darting through the tangled darkness i began to lose hope theres no way out i decided no way out i sank unhappily to the sticky hive floor and as i dropped three large bees moved in front of me they buzzed angrily bumping up against me with their hairy damp bodies it was easy to tell these bees were angry with me maybe it was because i wasnt doing my job but what was my job how could i tell the bees i didnt know what i was supposed to be doing i tried to slip past them but they moved to block my path three tough bees they made me think of barry marv and karl i shrank back as one of them pointed his stinger at me he was getting ready to kill me and i didnt even know what id done i screamed and whirled around as fast as my six legs would carry me i darted back down the narrow passageway and turned another corner oh i bumped hard into another bee luckily he was hurrying off somewhere and barely seemed to notice me i gasped with relief and then an idea came to me where was that bee going in such a hurry was he taking something somewhere could he be going to an area i hadnt searched yet i decided to follow him and find out i needed to learn everything i could about the hive maybe just maybe it would help me escape i hurried after the bee i thought id find him quickly but he was already long gone i searched in and out among the different honeycombs but i couldnt find him anywhere after a while i gave up way to go lutz the klutz i scolded myself i felt worse than ever i shot out my tongue and slurped up a big helping of honey to keep myself going then i began my endless searching again whoooa i stopped when i reached an area that looked familiar i was pretty sure it was the place where andretti had dropped me when he first put me into the hive all at once a large group of angrily buzzing bees crowded against me hey i protested as they shoved me forward they replied with a sharp rising buzz what were they doing were they attacking me were they all going to sting me at once they had me surrounded i couldnt run away but how could i possibly fight off all these bees i was doomed i realized finished sighing in defeat i closed my eyes and started to shake and waited for them to swarm over me i waited to be crushed and waited some more when i opened my eyes the angry bees had moved to the side of the hive they werent paying any attention to me i saw a single bee standing in the center of the hive floor he was performing a kind of jumping twisting hiphop dance how weird i thought the other bees were watching intently as if this were the most interesting thing in the world those bees didnt care about me i told myself they were trying to get me out of the way so this bee could do his dance i realized id wasted a lot of time i had to keep searching for an escape route i tried to push myself away from the group of bees but the hive floor had become too crowded to move the bee danced faster and faster he moved his body toward the right all the other bees stared intently at him what was going on at that moment something from my old big book of bees came back to me i remembered that bees send out scouts to find their food then the scouts dance to tell the other bees where to go get it if the scout was reporting on where to get food it meant hed just been out of the hive that meant there had to be a way out of this place i was so excited i almost started dancing but i didnt have a chance because suddenly all the bees in the hive rose up like a dark cloud i spread my wings and flew up with them as i followed the bees formed a single orderly line and shot out through a tiny hole in a far upper corner of the hive i buzzed around until i found the end of the line then i got ready to escape would i make it the very last bee in line i shot out of the tiny hole into open space for a few seconds i watched the other bees floating away busily hunting for nectar and pollen i knew i looked just like them the difference was that they would willingly return to andrettis hive but i never ever would at least not if i could help it fm out i cried joyfully in my tiny voice pm out im free dazzled by the sudden bright light of the outer world i flew around and around in the beekeeping area then i headed for the hole id seen in the screen when i was still in my own body i knew it was on the wall that faced my familys yard but when i flew over to it i stopped and gasped in disappointment the hole had been patched up mr andretti had fixed it oh no i wailed i cant be trapped i cant be my heart started thumping crazily my whole body was vibrating i forced myself to calm down and look around none of the other bees were in the screenedin area anymore theyd already gone outside to collect pollen and that meant there had to be another way out i wasnt thinking clearly because i was exhausted worn out from all my flying around i sat down on top of the hive to rest at that instant the door between the beekeeping area and the garage opened good morning my little bee friend mr andrettis voice boomed what are you doing lying around on top of the hive why arent you busy inside making me some honey are you sick you know we cant have any sick bees around here as i gazed up weakly mr andretti moved closer his huge dark shadow fell over me i tried to curl up into a ball and disappear but it was no use his large fingers were stretching right toward me i yelled in terror but of course he couldnt hear me what is he going to do to me i asked myself what does he do with sick bees what does he do with sick bees i wondered again quivering in terror he probably throws them in the garbage i thought or even worse he feeds them to his pet bird or frog despite my weariness i knew i couldnt wait around to find out i had to get out of there just as mr andrettis fingers were about to fold around me i shot up into the air and buzzed around his head at the same instant i saw some other bees flying in through a tiny hole in the screen it was in the corner near the ceiling i buzzed mr andrettis face one more time then i raced toward the hole as i tried to squeeze myself out the exit hole i crashed right into another bee who was flying in he glared at me and gave me an angry buzz frightened i backed off and clung to the screen i had to wait for a long line of bees to come back inside it seemed to take them forever when i was finally sure the last bee had come in i leaped forward and shot out of the hole i was out in the open sky this time i really am free i screamed in celebration forgetting my weariness and andrettis never going to catch this bee again i landed on a leaf and let the morning sun warm my back and wings it was a beautiful day a beautiful day for finding somebody who could help me get back into my human body like a rocket i shot straight up into the air and gazed around i recognized the familiar creak of my father opening the back door of my house panting hard i raced forward my father called goodbye hon tell the kids see them tonight over his shoulder and let go of the door i darted into the house the door slammed hard another near miss i hummed with happiness it felt so good to be back in my own house and out of that dark sticky hive i landed on the counter and gazed around at the old familiar walls why hadnt i ever realized how nice my house was before step step step someone was coming into the kitchen i flew up onto the windowsill for a better look krissy maybe i could get her to listen to me krissy krissy i buzzed over here by the window its me gary to my delight she turned and stared in my direction yes i cried excitedly yes its me its me oh terrific krissy groaned one of andrettis dumb bees got in here again okay so it wasnt exactly the reaction id been hoping for but shed still noticed me maybe i thought if i flew right onto her shoulder and spoke into her ear shed be able to understand me my heart vibrating my entire body i lifted myself up off the windowsill and soared toward my sister krissy i buzzed as i approached her shoulder you have to listen to me aaaaiii krissy screeched so loud i was afraid the glass in the windows would shatter get away from me bee she started thrashing her hands in the air trying to bat me away ow i cried out as she slapped me stung with pain i lost control and landed with a thud on the tiled countertop i raised my eyes in time to see krissy grab a flyswatter from out of the broom closet no krissy no i screamed not that you dont want to do that to your own brother my sister lifted up the flyswatter and thwacked it down right next to me i could feel the rush of air from it and i felt the entire counter shake i screamed and quickly rolled to one side krissy i knew was a menace with a flyswatter she was the champion in our family she never missed the eyes on top of my head spun in terror and in the gray blur i could see the shape of the flyswatter rising up to slap me again and again stop krissy i screamed stop youre squashing me with a strangled gasp i toppled off the counter i hit the floor hard and struggled dizzily to my feet now i started to get angry why did krissy have to be so bloodthirsty couldnt she just open a window and shoo me out buzzing weakly i floated up off the floor regaining my strength i began darting wildly around the room crashing into the walls and cupboards to show krissy how upset i was then i snot out of the kitchen in a rage i headed up the stairs to my room if my sister wouldnt help me id get someone else to help namely the new gary the morning sun was high in the sky but gary was still sound asleep in my bed seeing him lying there so peacefully so completely at home made me even angrier wake up you slug i buzzed at him he didnt move his mouth hung open as he slept making him look like a real jerk tuck what a creep i was sure my mouth never hung open when slept i decided to take action i landed on garys head and started walking around on his face i was sure my little insect legs would tickle him and wake him up nothing he didnt move even when i stuck a leg up his nose gary slept without stirring why is he so wrecked i wondered has he been wearing out my body furious i ran across garys face and climbed down through his hair then i crawled onto his ear buzz i shouted as loudly as i could buzz buzz buzz incredible as it seems the new gary didnt even budge just my luck dirk davis was turning out to be the worlds soundest sleeper i sighed and gave up i crawled off garys ear and flew around my old room gazing down at my bed my dresser and my computer my computer i cried excitedly maybe i can put a message on the screen maybe i can tell my parents what has happened to me i swooped down to the computer buzzing eagerly yes the computer had been left on what luck i knew i wasnt heavy enough to push the power button would i be strong enough to type a clear blue screen greeted me on the monitor my heart pounding i lowered myself to the keyboard and started hopping around on the letters yes i was heavy enough to make the keys go up and down i paused resting on the enter key what should i type what message should i put on the screen what what what as i frantically thought i heard gary stir behind me on the bed he let out a groan he was waking up quick i told myself type something type anything hell see it as soon as he gets out of bed i hopped over to the letters and began to jump up and down spelling out my desperate message it was hard work my bee eyes werent made for reading letters and i kept leaping up and failing in the cracks between the keys after eight or nine jumps i was gasping for air but i finished my message just as gary sat up in bed and stretched floating up in front of the monitor i struggled to read what i had typed i am not bee i am gary helo me through my blurred vision i saw that i missed the p in help and hit the instead i wanted to go back and fix it but i was totally wiped out i could barely buzz would they understand would they read the message and see me standing on top of the monitor and understand gary would understand i knew he would dirk davis would figure it out i climbed wearily to the top of the monitor and watched him climb out of bed here he comes i saw eagerly he brushed his hair out of his eyes he yawned he stretched again over here i urged dirk please check out the computer monitor dirk over here he picked up a crumpled pair of jeans off the floor and pulled them on then he found a wrinkled tshirt to go with it come on dirk i pleaded hopping up and down on top of the monitor read the screen please would he read it yes rubbing his eyes gary shuffled over to the computer yes yes i nearly burst for joy as i watched him squint at the screen go ahead gary read it read it i squeaked he squinted at the screen some more frowning did i leave that thing on overnight he muttered shaking his head wow i must be losing it he reached down and clicked off the power then he turned and made his way out of the room stunned i toppled off the monitor landing hard on the desk beside the keyboard all that work for nothing what was garys problem anyway doesnt he know how to read ive got to talk to him i told myself pulling myself together ive got to communicate with him somehow i lifted my wings and floated up after him i followed him through the kitchen and then slipped through the back door with him as he strode across the grass i started buzzing around his head but he didnt pay any attention to me he crossed the yard and opened our garage door then he went inside and brought out my old skateboard i hadnt used that skateboard in at least two years my uncle had given it to me for my tenth birthday and i almost broke my leg trying to ride it after that i put it away and refused to touch it again dont get on that thing i yelled at gary its dangerous you might hurt my body and i want it back in one piece of course gary didnt even notice me instead he carried the skateboard out in front of the house and put it down on the ground a short while later kaitlyn and judy walked up the sidewalk i waited for them to start giggling and making fun of the new me hi gary kaitlyn said she brushed some curly hair off her forehead and smiled are we late for our skateboarding lesson gary flashed her a big smile no way kaitlyn he answered in my voice want to head over to the playground like we did yesterday i couldnt believe my ears skateboarding lesson head over to the playground like we did yesterday what was going on around here i hope you dont mind gary judy said we told some of the other kids like gail and louie how good you are they all said they cant wait to take a lesson from you too is that okay because if it isnt we can call them and no problem jude gary broke in lets get going okay the new me hopped onto his skateboard and smoothly rolled his way down the sidewalk judy and kaitlyn hurried after him for a second i was too shocked to move but then i decided to follow them as i swooped after them i kept muttering to myself i cant believe it lutz the klutz is giving skateboard lessons at the playground everybodys waiting for him to show up what is going on a few minutes later the four of us had reached the playground sure enough a whole gang of kids was waiting there for gary he put down his skateboard and started giving everybody pointers on boarding as he called it i buzzed over to him and started shouting in his ear again dirk i shouted dirk davis its me the real gary lutz very casually he swatted me away i tried to speak to him again this time he swatted me really hard sending me spinning to the ground trying to shake off the pain i gave up dirk isnt going to help me i realized ms karmen is my only hope after all she was the one with all the equipment she was the only person who could reverse what she had done i flew onto a tree and tried to figure out which way to fly when youre an insect everything looks different to you things that seem small to a person appear huge to a bee so i wanted to be sure i didnt get myself mixed up and fly off in the wrong direction standing on a big leaf i gazed up and down the block until i was sure i knew which way to go as i got ready to take off a large shadow suddenly loomed over my head at first i thought it was a small bird but then i realized it was a dragonfly stay calm i told myself a dragonfly is an insect isnt it and insects dont eat each other right i guess no one had told the dragonfly before i could move it zoomed down wrapped its teeth around my middle and bit me in two i uttered a last gasp and waited for everything to go dark it took me a few seconds to realize that the dragonfly had turned and buzzed off in the other direction my imagination was running away with me thats what always happened when i got overtired i took a deep breath grateful to still be in one piece i decided i had to use my remaining strength to get to ms karmen at the persontoperson vacations office i rose up into the air looked both ways for oncoming dragonfly traffic then fluttered away after a long tiring trip i floated past a street sign that told me id made it to the right block roach street i buzzed along the sidewalk until i came to the persontoperson building then i sat down on the stoop and tried to figure out how i was going to get inside luckily as i rested on the warm cement i saw a mailman marching up the street stopping at each house along his route quickly i flew over to the persontoperson entrance and checked it out just as id hoped there was a mail slot in the middle of the door i buzzed over to the doorknob and waited for my chance slowly the mailman trudged up to the building hurry up i screamed at him do you think i have all day here of course he couldnt hear me he fumbled around in his bag and pulled out a bundle of letters then slowly he reached out and pushed open the mail slot before the mailman had a chance to react i swooped down in front of his nose and buzzed right through the mail slot as i zipped along i heard him gasp and i knew hed seen me but for once luck was with me i moved so quickly there hadnt been any time for the mailman to try to swat me my luck held when i flew up the stairs id just reached the top when the door to persontoperson vacations opened and a girl about my age came out she had long curly red hair and had a serious thoughtful expression on her face was she thinking of trading places with someone go home i shouted at her and dont come back stay away from this place just look what happened to me even though i was screaming the girl didnt even turn her head but she left the door open just long enough for me to buzz into the persontoperson office i flew across the waiting room and saw ms karmen sitting in the same chair shed been in when i first met her i shot right toward her and smacked into something hard pain roared through my body i dropped to the floor dizzy and confused as my head began to clear i remembered the glass wall separating ms karmen from the waiting area like some kind of brainless june bug id crashed right into it i shook myself to clear my mind ms karmen i yelled ms karmen its me gary lutz look what happened can you help me can you ms karmen didnt even glance up from her paperwork once again i realized no one could hear my squeaky insect voice with a defeated moan i sank down onto the seat of the chair and curled up into a tiny ball id come all this way for nothing i realized id found the one person in the world who might be able to help me and she couldnt even hear me i give up i whispered sadly its hopeless i have to get used to the idea of being a bee forever theres no way ill ever get my old body back i had never been so miserable in all my life i wished someone would come along drop into the chair and sit on me a strange sound startled me from my unhappy thoughts i sat up straight and listened hard whooah whooah it almost sounded like someone breathing but how could that be it was so loud i floated up off the chair and buzzed around the room trying to find out where the sound was coming from i had circled the room twice before i figured it out ms karmen was bending over to pick up something shed dropped on the floor her nose and mouth were only inches from the top of her desk and the microphone she used to talk to people had picked up the sounds of her breathing suddenly i had a brilliant idea if i could get to the other side of the glass i could use the microphone to make ms karmen hear me i swooped over to the wall and flew straight up to the ceiling no luck there the sheet of glass went all the way up there was no space for me to wedge myself through to the other side i buzzed down to the place where the glass met the top of ms karmens desk yes there was a small slot in the glass i remembered how she had passed through the book of photographs on my first visit to the office the slot wasnt very large but it was plenty big enough for my round little bee body i shot through the hole and jumped up on top of the microphone ms karmen i shouted putting my mouth next to the hard metal ms karmen her eyes opened wide her mouth dropped open in confusion she stared out into the waiting room searching for the person speaking its gary lutz i called out and im down here on your microphone ms karmen stared down at the microphone then her eyes narrowed in fear whats going on whos doing this is this a joke no i cried its no joke at all its really me gary lutz but but she stammered but no other words came out whats the joke how are you doing that her voice was so loud the sound waves nearly blasted me off the microphone you dont have to yell i cried i can hear you i dont believe this she exclaimed in a trembling voice she stared down at me its all your fault i shouted angrily you messed up the transfer operation when you made the switch one of my neighbors bees must have gotten into the machine so instead of putting me into dirk daviss body you put me into a bee ms karmen blinked then she slapped her forehead well that explains it she cried that explains why dirk daviss body has been behaving so strangely she picked up some papers on her desk and started putting them into her briefcase i really must apologize she said i feel really bad gary weve never had a mixup like this before i hope i hope its at least been interesting for you interesting i shrieked its been a nightmare you wouldnt believe what ive been through ive been attacked by screen doors cats flyswatters you name it you yourself almost ran me over with your car all the color drained from her face oh no she cried her voice a whisper im so sorry i i didnt know well what about it i asked her impatiently what about what what about getting me back into my body can you do it right away ms karmen cleared her throat well i could she replied slowly normally i could transfer you right back but theres a slight problem in your case what kind of problem i demanded its dirk davis ms karmen replied it seems hes become very attached to your old body he likes your house and your parents too in fact he even likes your sister krissy so i cried so whats that supposed to mean ms karmen stood up and pushed in her desk chair it means she said that dirk davis is refusing to give up your old body he says he absolutely wont go back to his old life he plans to keep your body forever what i screamed hopping up and down angrily on the microphone just what i said ms karmen said dirk davis wants to keep your body for the rest of his life but he cant do that can he it is very upsetting she replied biting her lower lip it wasnt what he said in our original agreement but if he refuses to get out of your body and your life theres really nothing i can do ms karmen gazed down at me sympathetically im so sorry about this gary she said softly i guess ill have to be more careful in the future what about my future what am i supposed to do now i wailed ms karmen shrugged i dont know maybe you could go back waitjn the hive and maybe dirk davis will change his mind back to the hive my antennas stood straight on end quivering with rage do you have any idea what its like in there cramped together with those hairy bees in the darkness listening to that deafening buzz day and night its a way of staying alive ms karmen replied bluntly i i dont care i stammered im never going back there never this is tragic tragic ms karmen cried ill give your case some thought tonight gary i promise maybe i can come up with a way of getting your body away from dirk she crossed the room and opened the office door im so upset so upset she murmured then she disappeared out the door slamming it behind her trembling with anger at dirk davis i hopped down to the desk hey wait i called after her youve locked me in ms karmen was so upset she forgot about me i rose up into the air and started after her but thei i happened to glance back down at her desk dirk daviss questionnaire was right on top of a pile of papers his address was next to his name he lived at eastwood avenue eastwood avenue was near the computer store so i knew where it was maybe the old dirk davis will know how to get my body back i told myself it was worth a try i ducked through the slot in the glass and flew around the waiting room no exit no open window no crack in the door once again i was trapped frantically i buzzed all around the waiting room then i went back through the slot in the glass i checked out the whole equipment room every window was closed tight i flew past a calendar and happened to see the date oh no i cried its friday its the weekend ms karmen might not come back to work for two whole days in two days i realized i would starve to death i had to get out i went over to the far wall and noticed another door i hadnt seen before i zipped through it the room turned out to be a tiny bathroom with one small window which was open just a crack it was all i needed hurray i yelled i shot out through the window and sailed into the open air then i turned right and headed for eastwood avenue luckily it wasnt very far away all this flying around was really beginning to wear me out i found dirk daviss house without any trouble when i got there i saw dirk himself or whoever he was now standing in the front yard i recognized him from the picture id seen in the persontoperson album hey i yelled to him hey er dirk the tall goodlooking boy turned around and stared at me his mouth moved and it looked as if he was saying something but i couldnt understand any words all i heard was a humming sound im gary lutz i cried in my little voice can you help me get dirk davis out of my body the boy stared at me then he grinned i was confused what was he grinning about hey you can hear me i cried now dirk motioned with his hand you want me to follow you i asked i felt excited are you taking me someplace where we can get help dirk grinned again then he turned and walked around the corner of the house i didnt know where we were going but i knew i had to follow him i found dirk in the back yard hum he said to me hum he pointed to a big rosebush and grinned then he stuck his nose deep inside one of the blossoms hummmmmmmmm he said yummmmmm i gaped at him in shock of course i cried you got the bees mind when i got the bees body dirk didnt say anything but when he pulled his face out of the rose the end of his nose was covered with yellow pollen dirk looked a little surprised and disappointed i guess he missed his long sucking tongue the tongue that was now hanging off the front of my face you cant help me i muttered to him youre in worse shape than i am hum he replied hum he looked kind of silly with that yellow nose but i felt sorry for him he and i had the wrong brains in the wrong bodies i knew exactly how he felt im going to go get help for both of us i told him if i get my body back maybe youll get yours too with a loud buzz i flew out of the davises yard as i left i thought i heard dirk buzz back at me i glanced over my wing and saw him sticking his face into another rose maybe this time hed have better luck getting the pollen out i headed toward my own house this time i planned to make dirk davis give me my body back or else as i turned up my street i suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from behind a tree dont mess with me dont mess with me man i couldnt believe it the voice belonged to marv but who was he talking to i shot around the tree to find out to my surprise i saw that marv was talking to me or dirk davis in my body barry and karl were right beside him look out dirk i thought run run please dont let them wreck my body but i was too late barry marv and karl were closing in on him about to give him the pounding of his life i flew closer look out dirk look out i squeaked but to my surprise the three hulking creeps werent moving in on gary they were backing away from him dont mess with me marv cried i said i was sorry we apologized barry whined dont hit us again gary please karl whimpered behind him nursing a bloody nose you guys are losers i heard gary tell them take a hike go get a life okay okay marv cried just no more rough stuff okay gary gary shook his head and walked away i dont believe this i thought gleefully barry marv and karl were afraid of me i decided id have some fun with them too i swooped down and landed on barrys nose buzzing as loudly and menacingly as i could yowwwww he shrieked in surprise and swatted himself on the nose i was too fast for him i was already on earls ear karl cried out and toppled backwards into a thorny rosebush then i buzzed round and around marv get away he shouted angrily and i flew right into his mouth his scream nearly deafened me but it was worth it marv started spitting and choking and gagging i flew up into the air laughing so hard i nearly popped my antennas that was the most fun id had since becoming a bee i watched the three gorillas run away then i flew up the block to my house gary had left the window open and i was able to shoot in he was lying on my bed reading one of my comic books and eating crackers with honey on them the honey smelled really good and i realized i was hungry again i reminded myself to stop by a flower and get a snack the next time i went outside but meanwhile i had work to do i flew over and landed on garys earlobe hey you dirk davis i yelled at the top of my little voice i need to talk to you he reached a hand up and flicked me off his face i fell down and landed with a bounce on the bed i buzzed angrily and shot light back up to his earlobe hey you i want my body back you have to get out of it now gary folded up his comic book and swung it at me i buzzed with rage and frustration i wasnt going to give up this time no way i had to make him hear me i rocketed up in the air and landed on the top of his head then i climbed down to his other earlobe and tried one more time tm not leaving you alone till you get out of my body i screeched do you hear me he sighed and shrugged his shoulders will you please quit bothering me he asked cant you see im trying to relax you can hear me yeah sure he muttered i can hear you okay you can i was so surprised i almost fell off his ear yes i can hear you perfectly weird huh im not sure why but i think some bee cells got mixed up with my human cells during our electronic transfer i can hear all kinds of little bug noises now your human cells those are my human cells i cried dirk shrugged enough chitchat i told him when do you plan to get out of my body never he replied he picked up his comic book and started reading it again i like your body i cant understand why you gave it up to go become a bee that wasnt my idea i screamed youve got a good life here he continued i mean you have great parents krissy is an okay sister and claus is an awesome cat too bad you didnt know all that when you were in your body which is now my body its not your body its mine give it back i started to buzz furiously all around his head swooping down in front of his nose crashing into his ears batting my wings in his eyes dirk davis didnt even flinch whats the matter with you anyway i yelled youre me now youre supposed to be scared of bees gary laughed youve forgotten something he said im not you im just inside your body im still me inside and im not the least bit afraid of bees and now he went on take a hike okay buzz off im busy frozen with anger and disappointment i slumped on the bedspread without moving gary raised the comic book up into the air id hate to swat you he said but i will if i have to i dodged away just as the comic book slapped down on the bedspread then i shot back out the window for a few minutes i flew aimlessly around lost in my sad thoughts finally i remembered how hungry i was i perched on top of a big orange lily blossom and started sucking up some nectar not bad i told myself as i drank but honey on crackers would be much better what am i supposed to do now i asked myself am i really doomed to be a bee for the rest of my life i pulled my head out of the orange blossom and looked around and how long is the rest of my life anyway i remembered a page from the big book of bees the life of the average bee is not very long while the queen can live through as many as five winters the workers and drones die off in the fall in the fall it was already nearly august if i stayed in this bee body i had only a month or two at most i gazed sadly up at my house gary had turned the light on in my room and it twinkled in the early evening dusk how i wished i could be up there why why had i ever been stupid enough to think id be better off in someone elses body then i heard a buzz i peered over the blossom sure enough i saw a bee he hopped up onto the flower two other bees quickly joined him then three more they buzzed angrily go away i cried i tried to fly away but before i could lift off they all swarmed over me i couldnt move the bees had taken me prisoner dont take me back to the hive i shrieked dont take me back but to my horror they started to drag me away i struggled to squirm away but they turned their stingers on me were they some kind of bee police did they think i was trying to escape the hive i didnt have a chance to discuss it with them they lifted me up into the air there were bees in front of me bees behind and bees on all sides we flew past my bedroom window help i called gary glanced up from his plate of crackers and honey he smiled and waved at me i was so angry i thought i might explode but then an idea came to me a crazy idea a desperate idea i buzzed as loudly as i could then i darted out of line and shot into the open bedroom window were the others following me were they yes they didnt want to let me escape gary sat up when he saw me and my buzzing followers he rolled up his comic book preparing to swat us i circled the room and the other bees followed get out get out gary screamed there werent enough of us i decided i needed a huge swarm i flew back out the window the others buzzed after me now i was the head bee as fast as i could i led my group back to mr andrettis garage and in through the hole in the screen i hesitated at the hive entrance i took a deep breath was i really going to go back inside i knew i had no choice go for it lutz i shouted to myself i shot in through the entrance hole then i began flying crazily through the hive buzzing angrily bumping the walls bumping other bees the hive stirred to life the buzzing grew to a dull roar then a loud roar then a deafening roar round and round i raged flying faster faster throwing myself frantically against the sticky hive walls tumbling darting buzzing furiously the entire hive was in an uproar now i had turned the bees into an angry swarm out of the hive i flew out into the darkening evening out through the hole in the screen up up and away and the bees swarmed after me like a black cloud against the grayblue sky up we soared up up a buzzing swarming funnel cloud up up i led them up to the bedroom window tumbling over each other raging through the air we swarmed into garys room huh he jumped off the bed he didnt have time to say a word i landed in his hair the raging swarm followed buzzing angrily surrounding him covering his head his face his shoulders hhelp his weak cry was drowned out by the roar of the bees help me i dropped down onto the tip of garys nose have you had enough i demanded are you ready to give me back my body never he cried i dont care what you do to me youll never get your body back its mine and im keeping it forever whoooa i could not believe my ears i mean he was covered in bees and still he wouldnt listen to reason i didnt know what to do the other bees were starting to lose interest some of them drifted to the plate of honey most of them floated back out the open window you cant get away with this dirk i screamed with a furious wail i whirled around then i stabbed my razorsharp stinger deep into the side of garys nose owwwwwww he let out a highpitched shriek and grabbed at his nose then he staggered backwards and fell over onto the bed yaaaaay i cried out in celebration for one instant i felt triumphant a tiny bee had defeated a huge enemy i was victorious i had won a fight against a giant my celebration didnt last very long i suddenly realized what i had done and i remembered what happens to a honeybee after it stings someone im going to die i murmured weakly i stung someone and now im going to die weaker i felt the strength drain from me weaker and weaker what have i done i asked myself i gave up my life for the chance to sting dirk davis why was i such a jerk i struggled to keep my wings moving struggled to stay in the air i knew i was doomed but i wanted to stay alive as long as i could maybe i thought as i felt my strength fading maybe have a chance to tell my family goodbye mom dad krissy i buzzed faintly where are you it was hard to breathe i felt so tired so weak i floated out the window and sank to the grass below i thought i recognized the shape of the old maple tree where i used to read books and spy on mr andretti but my sight was so bad it was hard to be sure about anything the whole world swirled in gray shadow i could no longer hold up my head the gray shadows grew darker and darker until the world faded completely from view i sat up slowly the ground spun beneath me where was i my back yard i blinked struggling to bring it all into focus waiting for my eyes to clear theres the old maple tree i cried and theres my house and theres mr andrettis house was i alive was i really alive sitting in my back yard seeing all the familiar places did i have my strength back i decided to test it i tried to spread my wings and fly up into the air but for some reason my wings didnt seem to be working my body felt heavy and strange i frowned and looked down inspecting myself to see what was wrong whoooa i cried out in surprise instead of six legs i saw two arms and two legs and my skinny old body breathlessly i reached up to touch my face my extra eyes were gone and so were my antennas and my layer of feathery fuzz instead i felt hair and smooth human skin i jumped up and shouted for joy im a person again im me im me i threw my arms around my chest and gave myself a hug then i danced around the back yard testing my arms and legs they worked they all worked i couldnt get over how wonderful it was to be human again but how did it happen i asked myself what happened to dirk davis for a chilling instant i wondered if dirk had been forced into a bees body the way i had probably not i decided but what had happened how did i get my body back was it the bee sting did the shock of the sting send us all back to the bodies we belonged in ive got to call ms karmen and find out i realized but for now all i wanted to do was see my family i hurried up the back steps and into the house as i ran through the kitchen i crashed right into krissy as usual she was carrying claus under one arm watch where youre going krissy snapped at me she probably expected me to snap back at her and try to push her out of my way but instead i grabbed her shoulders and gave her a big hug then i planted a kiss on her cheek yuck gross she cried and wiped the cheek with her hand i laughed happily dont give me your cooties creep krissy cried youre a creep i replied no youre a creep she repeated youre a jerk i shouted it felt so good to be calling her names again i gleefully called her a few more things then i hurried upstairs to see my parents i met themas they were coming out of my room mom dad i cried i hurried to them planning to throw my arms around them but they thought i was just trying to get into my room dont go in there gary warned my dad you left your window open again and a x swarm of bees got in there youd better go next door mom said get mr andretti hell know how to get them out i couldnt hold back any longer i threw my arms around my mothers neck and gave her a big kiss mom i missed you so much my mother hugged me back but i saw her exchange a curious look with my dad gary she asked are you okay how could you miss me when youve been right here in this house well i thought fast i meant that i missed spending time with you we really need to do more things together my mother spread one hand over my forehead no no temperature she told my lather gary dad said impatiently would you mind running over and getting mr andretti if we dont get those bees out of your room youll never be able to go to steep tonight bees i said casually hey no problem ill take care of them i reached out and started to open my door before i could dad grabbed my arm gary he cried in alarm whats the matter with you there are bees in your room bees dont you remember youre scared of bees i stared back at him and thought about what hed said to my surprise i realized i was no longer the slightest bit scared of bees in fact i was actually looking forward to seeing them again no problem dad i told him i guess i must have outgrown that or something i opened the door and went into my room sure enough there was the old swarm buzzing away over the plate of honey and crackers on the bed hi guys i said cheerfully time to leave now i walked over to the bed and waved my hands at them trying to shoo them back out the window a few of them buzzed angrily at me i laughed to myself then i picked up the plate of crackers and honey and dumped it out the window go get it i told them i shooed them gently out the window goodbye i called to them as they left thanks take good care of the honeycombs ill try to come visit as soon as i can when the last bee was gone i turned around and saw my parents they were standing absolutely motionless in the doorway staring at me frozen with shock dad i said mom my dad blinked and seemed to come back to life he crossed the room and put a hand on my shoulder gary are you feeling all right just fine i replied grinning happily just fine that whole crazy adventure happened about a month ago now its nearly fall im sitting in my favorite place under the maple tree in the back yard reading a book and chomping down taco chips i just love coining out here all the fall flowering plants are in bloom and the yard is really pretty ive been spending the last few days of my summer vacation relaxing back here of course i also go to the playground a lot the other day i ran into that girl with the red hair i saw coming out of the persontoperson office we started talking and i didnt trip over my own feet or anything she seems very nice i hope she doesnt plan to switch lives with anybody else that conversation and a lot of things have made me realize that my short life as a bee really changed me first of all it taught me to appreciate my family for the first time ever my parents are pretty nice and my sister is okay for a sister and now im not scared of any of the things i used to be scared of yesterday i walked right by marv barry and karl and i didnt bat an eye in fact when i remembered how i buzzed them i almost burst out laughing im not at all scared of them anymore and im different in other ways too im a lot better at sports and bike riding and things and im a great skateboarder now in fact i still give lessons judy and kaitlyn hang around me all the time and gail and louie too the other day i actually ran into dirk davis at the playground at first i didnt want to talk to him but then he turned out to be pretty nice he apologized to me im sorry i tried to steal your body he said but things didnt turn out so well for me either that bee flunked all my math tests in summer school we both had a good laugh about that and now dirk and i are friends so all in all my life is back to normal i feel terrific totally normal in fact i feel much better than normal its so great to sit here in the back yard reading and relaxing smelling the fresh fall air enjoying the flowers mmmmmm those hollyhocks are really awesome excuse me a moment while i get up and take a closer look that blossom down near the ground is so perfect i think ill get down on my knees to take a quick taste do you know how to suck the pollen out ive figured out the best way its not as hard as it looks you just pucker your lips and stick your tongue way out like this see then you dip your face down into the blossom and suck up all the pollen you want try it go ahead mmmmmmmm go ahead its easy really
