equal rites by terry pratchett thanks to neil gaiman who loaned us the last surviving copy of the liber paginarum fulvarum and a big hallo to all the kids at the hp lovecraft holiday fun club i would like it to be clearly understood that this book is not wacky only dumb redheads in fifties sitcoms are wacky no its not zany either this is a story about magic and where it goes and perhaps more importantly where it comes from and why although it doesnt pretend to answer all or any of these questions it may however help to explain why gandalf never got married and why merlin was a man because this is also a story about sex although probably not in the athletic tumbling countthelegsanddividebytwo sense unless the characters get totally beyond the authors control they might however it is primarily a story about a world here it comes now watch closely the special effects are quite expensive a bass note sounds it is a deep vibrating chord that hints that the brass section may break in at any moment with a fanfare for the cosmos because the scene is the blackness of deep space with a few stars glittering like the dandruff on the shoulders of god then it comes into view overhead bigger than the biggest most unpleasantly armed starcruiser in the imagination of a threering filmmaker a turtle ten thousand miles long it is great atuin one of the rare astrochelonians from a universe where things are less as they are and more like people imagine them to be and it carries on its meteorpocked shell four giant elephants who bear on their enormous shoulders the great round wheel of the discworld as the viewpoint swings around the whole of the world can be seen by the light of its tiny orbiting sun there are continents archipelagos seas deserts mountain ranges and even a tiny central ice cap the inhabitants of this place it is obvious wont have any truck with global theories their world bounded by an encircling ocean that falls forever into space in one long waterfall is as round and flat as a geological pizza although without the anchovies a world like that which exists only because the gods enjoy a joke must be a place where magic can survive and sex too of course he came walking through the thunderstorm and you could tell he was a wizard partly because of the long cloak and careen staff but mainly because the raindrops were stopping several feet from his head and steaming it was good thunderstorm country up here in the ramtop mountains a country of jagged peaks dense forests and little river valleys so deep the daylight had no sooner reached the bottom than it was time to leave again ragged wisps of cloud clung to the lesser peaks below the mountain trail along which the wizard slithered and slid a few sloteyed goats watched him with mild interest it doesnt take a lot to interest goats sometimes he would stop and throw his heavy staff into the air it always came down pointing the same way and the wizard would sigh pick it up and continue his squelchy progress the storm walked around the hills on legs of lightning shouting and grumbling the wizard disappeared around the bend in the track and the goats went back to their damp grazing until something else caused them to look up they stiffened their eyes widening their nostrils flaring this was strange because there was nothing on the path but the goats still watched it pass by until it was out of sight there was a village tucked in a narrow valley between steep woods it wasnt a large village and wouldnt have shown up on a map of the mountains it barely showed up on a map of the village it was in fact one of those places that exist merely so that people can have come from them the universe is littered with them hidden villages windswept little towns under wide skies isolated cabins on chilly mountains whose only mark on history is to be the incredibly ordinary place where something extraordinary started to happen often there is no more than a little plaque to reveal that against all ecological probability someone very famous was born halfway up a wall mist curled between the houses as the wizard crossed a narrow bridge over the swollen stream and made his way to the village smithy although the two facts had nothing to do with one another the mist would have curled anyway it was experienced mist and had got curling down to a fine art the smithy was fairly crowded of course a smithy is one place where you can depend on finding a good fire and someone to talk to several villagers were lounging in the warm shadows but as the wizard approached they sat up expectantly and tried to look intelligent generally with indifferent success the smith didnt feel the need to be quite so subservient he nodded at the wizard but it was a greeting between equals or at least between equals as far as the smith was concerned after all any halfway competent blacksmith has more than a nodding acquaintance with magic or at least likes to think he has the wizard bowed a white cat that had been sleeping by the furnace woke up and watched him carefully what is the name of this place sir said the wizard the blacksmith shrugged bad ass he said bad ass repeated the blacksmith his tone defying anyone to make something of it the wizard considered this a name with a story behind it he said at last which were circumstances otherwise i would be pleased to hear but i would like to speak to you smith about your son which one said the smith and the hangerson sniggered the wizard smiled you have seven sons do you not and you yourself were an eighth son the smiths face stiffened he turned to the other villagers all right the rains stopping he said piss off the lot of you me and he looked at the wizard with raised eyebrows drum billet said the wizard me and mr billet have things to talk about he waved his hammer vaguely and one after another craning over their shoulders in case the wizard did anything interesting the audience departed the smith drew a couple of stools from under a bench he took a bottle out of a cupboard by the water tank and poured a couple of very small glasses of clear liquid the two men sat and watched the rain and the mist rolling over the bridge then the smith said i know what son you mean old granny is up with my wife now eighth son of an eighth son of course it did cross my mind but i never gave it much thought to be honest well well a wizard in the family eh you catch on very quickly said billet the white cat jumped down from its perch sauntered across the floor and vaulted into the wizards lap where it curled up his thin fingers stroked it absentmindedly well well said the smith again a wizard in bad ass eh possibly possibly said billet of course hell have to go to university first he may do very well of course the smith considered the idea from all angles and decided he liked it a lot a thought struck him hang on he said im trying to remember what my father told me a wizard who knows hes going to die can sort of pass on his sort of wizardness to a sort of successor right i have never heard it put so succinctly yes said the wizard so youre going to sort of die oh yes the cat purred as the fingers tickled it behind the ear the smith looked embarrassed when the wizard thought for a moment in about six minutes time oh dont worry said the wizard im quite looking forward to it to tell you the truth ive heard its quite painless the blacksmith considered this who told you he said at last the wizard pretended not to hear him he was watching the bridge looking for telltale turbulence in the mist look said the smith youd better tell me how we go about bringing up a wizard you see because there isnt a wizard in these parts and it will all sort itself out said billet pleasantly the magic has guided me to you and the magic will take care of everything it usually does did i hear a cry the blacksmith looked at the ceiling above the splash of the rain he could make out the sound of a pair of new lungs at full bore the wizard smiled have him brought down here he said the cat sat up and looked interestedly at the forges wide doorway as the smith called excitedly up the stairs it jumped down and padded slowly across the floor purring like a bandsaw a tall whitehaired woman appeared at the bottom of the stairs clutching a bundle in a blanket the smith hurried her over to where the wizard sat but she began this is very important said the smith importantly what do we do now sir the wizard held up his staff it was manhigh and nearly as thick as his wrist and covered with carvings that seemed to change as the smith looked at them exactly as if they didnt want him to see what they were the child must hold it said drum billet the smith nodded and fumbled in the blanket until he located a tiny pink hand he guided it gently to the wood it gripped it tightly but said the midwife its all right granny i know what im about shes a witch sir dont mind her right said the smith now what the wizard was silent what do we donthe smith began and stopped he leaned down to look at the old wizards face billet was smiling but it was anyones guess what the joke was the smith pushed the baby back into the arms of the frantic midwife then as respectfully as possible he unpried the thin pale fingers from the staff it had a strange greasy feel like static electricity the wood itself was almost black but the carvings were slightly lighter and hurt the eyes if you tried to make out precisely what they were supposed to be are you pleased with yourself said the midwife eh oh yes as a matter of fact yes why she twitched aside a fold of the blanket the smith looked down and swallowed no he whispered he said and what would he know about it sneered granny but he said it would be a son doesnt look like a son to me laddie the smith flopped down on his stool his head in his hands what have i done he moaned youve given the world its first female wizard said the midwife whosa itsywitsy den what i was talking to the baby the white cat purred and arched its back as if it was rubbing up against the legs of an old friend which was odd because there was no one there i was foolish said a voice in tones no mortal could hear i assumed the magic would know what it was doing perhaps it does if only i could do something there is no going back there is no going back said the deep heavy voice like the closing of crypt doors the wisp of nothingness that was drum billet thought for a while but shes going to have a lot of problems thats what life is all about so im told i wouldnt know of course what about reincarnation death hesitated you wouldnt like it he said take it from me ive heard that some people do it all the time youve got to be trained to it youve got to start off small and work up youve no idea how horrible it is to be an ant its bad you wouldnt believe it and with your karma an ant is too much to expect the baby had been taken back to its mother and the smith sat disconsolately watching the rain drum billet scratched the cat behind its ears and thought about his life it had been a long one that was one of the advantages of being a wizard and hed done a lot of things he hadnt always felt good about it was about time that i havent got all day you know said death reproachfully the wizard looked down at the cat and realized for the first time how odd it looked now the living often dont appreciate how complicated the world looks when you are dead because while death frees the mind from the straitjacket of three dimensions it also cuts it away from time which is only another dimension so while the cat that rubbed up against his invisible legs was undoubtedly the same cat that he had seen a few minutes before it was also quite clearly a tiny kitten and a fat halfblind old moggy and every stage in between all at once since it had started off small it looked like a white catshaped carrot a description that will have to do until people invent proper fourdimensional adjectives deaths skeletal hand tapped billet gently on the shoulder come away my son theres nothing i can do life is for the living anyway youve given her your staff yes there is that the midwifes name was granny weatherwax she was a witch that was quite acceptable in the ramtops and no one had a bad word to say about witches at least not if he wanted to wake up in the morning the same shape as he went to bed the smith was still staring gloomily at the rain when she came back down the stairs and clapped a warty hand on his shoulder he looked up at her what shall i do granny he said unable to keep the pleading out of his voice what have you done with the wizard i put him out in the fuel store was that right itll do for now she said briskly and now you must burn the staff they both turned to stare at the heavy staff which the smith had propped in the forges darkest corner it almost appeared to be looking back at them but its magical he whispered well will it burn never knew wood that didnt it doesnt seem right granny weatherwax swung shut the big doors and turned to him angrily now you listen to me gordo smith she said female wizards arent right either its the wrong kind of magic for women is wizard magic its all books and stars and jommetry shed never grasp it whoever heard of a female wizard theres witches said the smith uncertainly and enchantresses too ive heard witches is a different thing altogether snapped granny weatherwax its magic out of the ground not out of the sky and men never could get the hang of it as for enchantresses she added theyre no better than they should be you take it from me just burn the staff bury the body and dont let on it ever happened smith nodded reluctantly crossed over to the forge and pumped the bellows until the sparks flew he went back for the staff it wouldnt move it wont move sweat stood out of his brow as he tugged at the wood it remained uncooperatively immobile here let me try said granny and reached past him there was a snap and a smell of scorched tin smith ran across the forge whimpering slightly to where granny had landed upside down against the opposite wall are you all right she opened two eyes like angry diamonds and said i see thats the way of it is it the way of what said smith totally bewildered help me up you fool and fetch me a chopper the tone of her voice suggested that it would be a very good idea not to disobey smith rummaged desperately among the junk at the back of the forge until he found an old doubleheaded axe right now take off your apron why what do you intend to do said the smith who was beginning to lose his grip on events granny gave an exasperated sigh its leather you idiot im going to wrap it around the handle itll not catch me the same way twice smith struggled out of the heavy leather apron and handed it to her very gingerly she wrapped it around the axe and made one or two passes in the air then a spiderlike figure in the glow of the nearly incandescent furnace she stalked across the room and with a grunt of triumph and effort brought the heavy blade sweeping down right in the center of the staff there was a click there was a noise like a partridge there was a thud there was silence smith reached up very slowly without moving his head and touched the axe blade it wasnt on the axe any more it had buried itself in the door by his head taking a tiny nick out of his ear granny stood looking slightly blurred from hitting an absolutely immovable object and stared at the stub of wood in her hands rrrrightttt she stuttered iiiinnn tthhatttt cccasseee no said smith firmly rubbing his ear whatever it is youre going to suggest no leave it ill pile some stuff around it no onell notice leave it its just a stick just a stick have you got any better ideas ones that wont take my head off she glared at the staff which appeared not to notice not right now she admitted but you just give me time all right all right anyway ive got things to do wizards to bury you know how it is smith took a spade from beside the back door and hesitated granny what do you know how wizards like to be buried yes well how granny weatherwax paused at the bottom of the stairs reluctantly later night fell gently as the last of the worlds slow light flowed out of the valley and a pale rainwashed moon shone down in a night studded with stars and in a shadowy orchard behind the forge there was the occasional clink of a spade or a muffled curse in the cradle upstairs the worlds first female wizard dreamed of nothing much the white cat lay halfasleep on its private ledge near the furnace the only sound in the warm dark forge was the crackle of the coals as they settled down under the ash the staff stood in the corner where it wanted to be wrapped in shadows that were slightly blacker than shadows normally are time passed which basically is its job there was a faint tinkle and a swish of air after a while the cat sat up and watched with interest dawn came up here in the ramtops dawn was always impressive especially when a storm had cleared the air the valley occupied by bad ass overlooked a panorama of lesser mountains and foothills coloured purple and orange in the early morning light that flowed gently over them and far off the great plains were still a puddle of shadows even further off the sea gave an occasional distant sparkle in fact from here you could see right to the edge of the world that wasnt poetic imagery but plain fact since the world was quite definitely flat and was furthermore known to be carried through space on the backs of four elephants that in turn stood on the shell of great atuin the great sky turtle back down there in bad ass the village is waking up the smith has just gone into the forge and found it tidier than it has been for the last hundred years with all the tools back in their right places the floor swept and a new fire laid in the furnace he is sitting on the anvil which has been moved right across the room and is watching the staff and is trying to think nothing much happened for seven years except that one of the apple trees in the smithy orchard grew perceptibly taller than the others and was frequently climbed by a small girl with brown hair a gap in her front teeth and the sort of features that promised to become if not beautiful then at least attractively interesting she was named eskarina for no particular reason other than that her mother liked the sound of the word and although granny weatherwax kept a careful watch on her she failed to spot any signs of magic whatsoever it was true that the girl spent more time climbing trees and running around shouting than little girls normally did but a girl with four older brothers still at home can be excused a lot of things in fact the witch began to relax and started to think the magic had not taken hold after all but magic has a habit of lying low like a rake in the grass winter came round again and it was a bad one the clouds hung around the ramtops like big fat sheep filling the gulleys with snow and turning the forests into silent gloomy caverns the high passes were closed and the caravans wouldnt come again until spring bad ass became a little island of heat and light over breakfast esks mother said im worried about granny weatherwax she hasnt been around lately smith looked at her over his porridge spoon im not complaining he said she shes got a long nose said esk her parents glared at her theres no call to make that kind of remark said her mother sternly but father said shes always poking her eskarina but he said i said yes but he did say that she had smith reached down and slapped her it wasnt very hard and he regretted it instantly the boys got the flat of his hand and occasionally the length of his belt whenever they deserved it the trouble with his daughter though was not ordinary naughtiness but the infuriating way she had of relentlessly pursuing the thread of an argument long after she should have put it down it always flustered him she burst into tears smith stood up angry and embarrassed at himself and stumped off to the forge there was a loud crack and a thud they found him out cold on the floor afterwards he always maintained that hed hit his head on the doorway which was odd because he wasnt very tall and there had always been plenty of room before but he was certain that whatever happened had nothing to do with the blur of movement from the forges darkest corner somehow the events set the seal on the day it became a broken crockery day a day of people getting under each others feet and being peevish esks mother dropped a jug that had belonged to her grandmother and a whole box of apples in the loft turned out to be moldy in the forge the furnace went sullen and refused to draw jaims the oldest son slipped on the packed ice in the road and hurt his arm the white cat or possibly one of its descendants since the cats led a private and complicated life of their own in the hayloft next to the forge went and climbed up the chimney in the scullery and refused to come down even the sky pressed in like an old mattress and the air felt stuffy despite the snow frayed nerves and boredom and bad temper made the air hum like thunderstorm weather right thats it thats just about enough shouted esks mother cern you and gulta and esk can go and see how granny is and wheres esk the two youngest boys looked up from where they were halfheartedly fighting under the table she went out to the orchard said gulta again go and fetch her in then and be off but its cold its going to snow again its only a mile and the road is clear enough and who was so keen to be out in it when we had the first snowfall go on with you and dont come back till youre in a better temper they found esk sitting in a fork of the big apple tree the boys didnt like the tree much for one thing it was so covered in mistletoe that it looked green even in midwinter its fruit was small and went from stomachtwisting sourness to waspfilled rottenness overnight and although it looked easy enough to climb it had a habit of breaking twigs and dislodging feet at inconvenient moments cern once swore that a branch had twisted just to spill him off but it tolerated esk who used to go and sit in it if she was annoyed or fed up or just wanted to be by herself and the boys sensed that every brothers right to gently torture his sister ended at the foot of its trunk so they threw a snowball at her it missed were going to see old weatherwax but you dont have to come because youll just slow us down and probably cry anyway esk looked down at them solemnly she didnt cry a lot it never seemed to achieve much if you dont want me to come then ill come she said this sort of thing passes for logic among siblings oh we want you to come said gulta quickly very pleased to hear it said esk dropping on to the packed snow they had a basket containing smoked sausages preserved eggs and because their mother was prudent as well as generous a large jar of peach preserve that no one in the family liked very much she still made it every year when the little wild peaches were ripe anyway the people of bad ass had learned to live with the long winter snows and the roads out of the village were lined with boards to reduce drifting and more important stop travellers from straying if they lived locally it wouldnt matter too much if they did because an unsung genius on the village council several generations previously had come up with the idea of carving markers in every tenth tree in the forest around the village out to a distance of nearly two miles it had taken ages and recutting markers was always a job for any man with spare time but in winters where a blizzard could lose a man within yards of his home many a life had been saved by the pattern of notches found by probing fingers under the clinging snow it was snowing again when they left the road and started up the track where in summer the witchs house nestled in a riot of raspberry thickets and weird witchgrowth no footprints said cern except for foxes said gulta they say she can turn herself into a fox or anything a bird even anything thats how she always knows whats going on they looked around cautiously a scruffy crow was indeed watching them from a distant tree stump they say theres a whole family over crack peak way that can turn themselves into wolves said gulta who wasnt one to leave a promising subject because one night someone shot a wolf and next day their auntie was limping with an arrow wound in her leg and i dont think people can turn themselves into animals said esk slowly oh yes miss clever granny is quite big if she turned herself into a fox what would happen to all the bits that wouldnt fit shed just magic them away said cern i dont think magic works like that said esk you cant just make things happen theres a sort of like a seesaw thing if you push one end down the other end goes up her voice trailed off they gave her a look i cant see granny on a seesaw said gulta cern giggled no i mean every time something happens something else has to happen too i think said esk uncertainly picking her way around a deeper than usual snowdrift only in the opposite direction thats silly said gulta because look you remember when that fair came last summer and there was a wizard with it and he made all those birds and things appear out of nothing i mean it just happened he just said these words and waved his hands and it just happened there werent any seesaws there was a swing said cern and a thing where you had to throw things at things to win things and you didnt hit anything gul nor did you you said the things were stuck to the things so you couldnt knock them off you said their conversation wandered away like a couple of puppies esk listened with half an ear i know what i mean she told herself magics easy you just find the place where everything is balanced and push anyone could do it theres nothing magical about it all the funny words and waving the hands is just its only for she stopped surprised at herself she knew what she meant the idea was right up there in the front of her mind but she didnt know how to say it in words even to herself it was a horrible feeling to find things in your head and not know how they fitted it come on well be all day she shook her head and hurried after her brothers the witchs cottage consisted of so many extensions and leantos that it was difficult to see what the original building had looked like or even if there had ever been one in the summer it was surrounded by dense beds of what granny loosely called the herbs strange plants hairy or squat or twining with curious flowers or vivid fruits or unpleasantly bulging pods only granny knew what they were all for and any woodpigeon hungry enough to attack them generally emerged giggling to itself and bumping into things or sometimes never emerged at all now everything was deep under the snow a forlorn windsock flapped against its pole granny didnt hold with flying but some of her friends still used broomsticks it looks deserted said cem no smoke said gulta the windows look like eyes thought esk but kept it to herself its only grannys house she said theres nothing wrong the cottage radiated emptiness they could feel it the windows did look like eyes black and menacing against the snow and no one in the ramtops let their fire go out in the winter as a matter of pride esk wanted to say lets go home but she knew that if she did the boys would run for it instead she said mother says theres a key on a nail in the privy and that was nearly as bad even an ordinary unknown privy held minor terrors like wasps nests large spiders mysterious rustling things in the roof and one very bad winter a small hibernating bear that caused acute constipation in the family until it was persuaded to bed down in the haybam a witchs privy could contain anything ill go and look shall i she added if you like said gulta airily almost successfully concealing his relief in fact when she managed to get the door open against the piled snow it was neat and clean and contained nothing more sinister than an old almanac or more precisely about half an old almanac carefully hung on a nail granny had a philosophical objection to reading but shed be the last to say that books especially books with nice thin pages didnt have their uses the key shared a ledge by the door with a chrysalis and the stump of a candle esk took it gingerly trying not to disturb the chrysalis and hurried back to the boys it was no use trying the front door front doors in bad ass were used only by brides and corpses and granny had always avoided becoming either around the back the snow was piled in front of the door and no one had broken the ice on the water butt the light was starting to pour out of the sky by the time they dug through to the door and managed to persuade the key to turn inside the big kitchen was dark and chilly and smelled only of snow it was always dark but they were used to seeing a big fire in the wide chimney and smelling the thick fumes of whatever it was she was boiling up this time which sometimes gave you a headache or made you see things they wandered around uncertainly calling until esk decided they couldnt put off going upstairs any longer the clonk of the thumblatch on the door to the cramped staircase sounded a lot louder than it ought to granny was on the bed with her arms tightly folded across her chest the tiny window had blown open fine snow had blown in across the floor and over the bed esk stared at the patchwork quilt under the old woman because there were times when a little detail could expand and fill the whole world she barely heard cern start to cry she remembered lien father strangely enough making the quilt two winters before when the snow was almost as bad and there wasnt much to do in the forge and how hed used all kinds of rags that had found their way to bad ass from every part of the world like silk dilemma leather water cotton and tharga wool and of course since he wasnt much good at sewing either the result was a rather strange lumpy thing more like a flat tortoise than a quilt and her mother had generously decided to give it to granny last hogswatchnight and is she dead asked gulta as if esk was an expert in these things esk stared up at granny weatherwax the old womans face looked thin and grey was that how dead people looked shouldnt her chest be going up and down gulta pulled himself together we ought to go and get someone and we ought to go now because it will get dark in a minute he said flatly but cern will stay here his brother looked at him in horror what for he said someone has got to stay with dead people said gulta remember when old uncle derghart died and father had to go and sit up with all the candles and things all night otherwise something nasty comes and takes your soul off to to somewhere he ended lamely and then people come back and haunt you cern opened his mouth to start to cry again esk said hurriedly ill stay i dont mind its only granny gulta looked at her in relief light some candles or something he said i think thats what youre supposed to do and then there was a scratching from the windowsill a crow had landed and stood there blinking suspiciously at them gulta shouted and threw his hat at it it flew off with a reproachful caw and he shut the window ive seen it around here before he said i think granny feeds it fed it he corrected himself anyway well be back with people well be hardly any time come on ce they clattered down the dark stairs esk saw them out of the house and bolted the door behind them the sun was a red ball above the mountains and there were already a few early stars out she wandered around the dark kitchen until she found a scrap of dip candle and a tinderbox after a great deal of effort she managed to light the candle and stood it on the table although it didnt really light the room it simply peopled the darkness with shadows then she found grannys rocking chair by the cold fireplace and settled down to wait time passed nothing happened then there was a tapping at the window esk took up the candle stub and peered through the thick round panes a beady yellow eye blinked back at her the candle guttered and went out she stood stock still hardly breathing the tapping started again and then stopped there was a short silence and then the doorlatch rattled something nasty comes the boys had said she felt her way back across the room until she nearly tripped over the rocking chair and dragged it back and wedged it as best she could in front of the door the latch gave a final clonk and went silent esk waited listening until the silence roared in her ears then something started to bang against the little window in the scullery softly but insistently after a while it stopped a moment later it started again in the bedroom above her a faint scrabbling noise a claw kind of noise esk felt that bravery was called for but on a night like this bravery lasted only as long as a candle stayed alight she felt her way back across the dark kitchen eyes tightly shut until she reached the door there was a thump from the fireplace as a big lump of soot fell down and when she heard the desperate scratchings coming from the chimney she slipped the bolts threw open the door and darted out into the night the cold struck like a knife frost had put a crust on the snow she didnt care where she was going but quiet terror gave her a burning determination to get there as fast as she could inside the cottage the crow landed heavily in the fireplace surrounded by soot and muttering irritably to itself it hopped into the shadows and a moment later there was the bang of the latch of the stairway door and the sound of fluttering on the stairs esk reached up as high as she could and felt around the tree for the marker this time she was lucky but the pattern of dots and grooves told her she was over a mile from the village and had been running in the wrong direction there was a cheeserind moon and a sprinkling of stars small and bright and pitiless the forest around her was a pattern of black shadows and pale snow and she was aware not all the shadows were standing still everyone knew there were wolves in the mountains because on some nights their howls echoed down from the high tops but they seldom came near the village the modern wolves were the offspring of ancestors that had survived because they had learned that human meat had sharp edges but the weather was hard and this pack was hungry enough to forget all about natural selection esk remembered what all the children were told climb a tree light a fire when all else fails find a stick and at least hurt them never try to outrun them the tree behind her was a beech smooth and unclimbable esk watched a long shadow detach itself from a pool of darkness in front of her and move a little closer she knelt down tired frightened unable to think and scrabbled under the burningcold snow for a stick granny weatherwax opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling which was cracked and bulged like a tent she concentrated on remembering that she had arms not wings and didnt need to hop it was always wise to lie down for a bit after a borrow to let ones mind get used to ones body but she knew she didnt have the time drat the child she muttered and tried to fly on to the bedrail the crow who had been through all this dozens of times before and who considered insofar as birds can consider anything which is a very short distance indeed that a steady diet of bacon rinds and choice kitchen scraps and a warm roost for the night was well worth the occasional inconvenience of letting granny share its head watched her with mild interest granny found her boots and thumped down the stairs sternly resisting the urge to glide the door was wide open and there was already a drift of fine snow on the floor oh bugger she said she wondered if it was worth trying to find esks mind but human minds were never so sharp and clear as animal minds and anyway the overmind of the forest itself made impromptu searching as hard as listening for a waterfall in a thunderstorm but even without looking she could feel the packmind of the wolves a sharp rank feeling that filled the mouth with the taste of blood she could just make out the small footprints in the crust half filled with fresh snow cursing and muttering granny weatherwax pulled her shawl around her and set out the white cat awoke from its private ledge in the forge when it heard the sounds coming from the darkest corner smith had carefully shut the big doors behind him when he went off with the nearlyhysterical boys and the cat watched with interest as a thin shadow prodded at the lock and tested the hinges the doors were oak hardened by heat and time but that didnt prevent them being blown right across the street smith heard a sound in the sky as he hurried along the track so did granny it was a determined whirring sound like the flight of geese and the snowclouds boiled and twisted as it passed the wolves heard it too as it spun low over the treetops and hurtled down into the clearing but they heard it far too late granny weatherwax didnt have to follow the footprints now she aimed herself for the distant flashes of weird light the strange swishing and thumping and the howls of pain and terror a couple of wolves bolted past her with their ears flattened in grim determination to have it away on their paws no matter what stood in their way there was the crackle of breaking branches something big and heavy landed in a fir tree by granny and crashed whimpering into the snow another wolf passed her in a flat trajectory at about head height and bounced off a treetrunk there was silence granny pushed her way between the snowcovered branches she could see that the snow was flattened in a white circle a few wolves lay at its edges either dead or wisely deciding to make no move the staff stood upright in the snow and granny got the feeling it was turning to face her as she walked carefully past it there was also a small heap in the centre of the circle curled tightly up inside itself granny knelt down with some effort and reached out gently the staff moved it was little more than a tremble but her hand stopped just before it touched esks shoulder granny glared up at the wooden carvings and dared it to move again the air thickened then the staff seemed to back away while not moving while at the same time something quite indefinable made it absolutely clear to the old witch that as far as the staff was concerned this wasnt a defeat it was merely a tactical consideration and it wouldnt like her to think she had won in any way because she hadnt esk gave a shudder granny patted her vaguely its me little one its only old granny the hump didnt uncurl granny bit her lip she was never quite certain about children thinking of them when she thought about them at all as coming somewhere between animals and people she understood babies you put milk in one end and kept the other end as clean as possible adults were even easier because they did the feeding and cleaning themselves but in between was a world of experience that she had never really enquired about as far as she was aware you just tried to stop them catching anything fatal and hoped that it would all turn out all right granny in fact was at a loss but she knew she had to do something didda nasty wolfie fwiten us den she hazarded for quite the wrong reasons this seemed to work from the depths of the ball a muffled voice said i am eight you know people who are eight dont curl up in the middle of the snow said granny feeling her way through the intricacies of adultchild conversation the ball didnt answer ive probably got some milk and biscuits at home granny ventured there was no perceptible effect eskarina smith if you dont behave this minute i will give you such a smack esk poked her head out cautiously theres no need to be like that she said when smith reached the cottage granny had just arrived leading esk by the hand the boys peered around from behind him um said smith not quite aware of how to begin a conversation with someone who was supposed to be dead they um told me you were ill he turned and glared at his sons i was just having a rest and i must have dozed off i sleeps very sound yes said smith uncertainly well alls well then whats up with esk she took a bit of a fright said granny squeezing the girls hand shadows and whatnot she needs a good warm i was going to put her in my bed shes a bit mazed if thats all right with you smith wasnt absolutely sure that it was all right with him but he was quite sure that his wife like every other woman in the village held granny weatherwax in solemn regard even in awe and that if he started to object he would rapidly get out of his depth fine fine he said if its no trouble ill send along for her in the morning shall i thats right said granny id invite you in but theres me without a fire no no thats all right said smith hurriedly ive got my supper waiting drying up he added looking down at gulta who opened his mouth to say something and wisely thought better of it when they had gone with the sound of the two boys protests ringing out among the trees granny opened the door pushed esk inside and bolted it behind them she took a couple of candles from her store above the dresser and lit them then she pulled some old but serviceable wool blankets still smelling of antimoth herbs from an old chest wrapped esk in them and sat her in the rocking chair she got down on her knees to an accompaniment of clicks and grunts and started to lay the fire it was a complicated business involving dry fungus punk wood shavings bits of split twig and much puffing and swearing esk said you dont have to do it like that granny granny stiffened and looked at the fireback it was a rather nice one smith had cast for her years ago with an owlandbat motif currently though she wasnt interested in the design oh yes she said her voice deadlevel you know of a better way do you you could magic it alight granny paid great attention to arranging bits of twig on the reluctant flames how would i do that pray she said apparently addressing her remarks to the fireback er said esk i i cant remember but you must know anyway dont you everyone knows you can do magic theres magic said granny and then again theres magic the important thing my girl is to know what magic is for and what it isnt for and you can take it from me it was never intended for lighting fires you can be absolutely certain of that if the creator had meant us to use magic for lighting fires then he wouldnt have given us er matches but could you light a fire with magic said esk as granny slung an ancient black kettle on its hook i mean if you wanted to if it was allowed maybe said granny who couldnt fire had no mind it wasnt alive and they were two of the three reasons you could light it much better if a things worth doing its worth doing badly said granny fleeing into aphorisms the last refuge of an adult under siege yes but but me no buts granny rummaged in a dark wooden box on the dresser she prided herself on her unrivalled knowledge of the properties of ramtops herbage none knew better than she the many uses of earwort maidens wish and loveliesoozing but there were times when she had to resort to her small stock of jealously traded and carefully hoarded medicines from forn parts to achieve the desired effect she shredded some dry red leaves into a mug topped it up with honey and hot water from the kettle and pushed it into esks hands then she put a large round stone under the grate later on wrapped in a scrap of blanket it would make a bedwarmer and with a stern injunction to the girl not to stir from the chair went out into the scullery esk drummed her heels on the chair legs and sipped the drink it had a strange peppery taste she wondered what it was shed tasted grannys brews before of course with a greater or lesser amount of honey in them depending on whether she thought you were making too much of a fuss and esk knew that she was famous throughout the mountains for special potions for illnesses that her mother and some young women too once in a while just hinted at with raised eyebrows and lowered voices when granny came back she was asleep she didnt remember being put to bed or granny bolting the windows granny weatherwax went back downstairs and pulled her rocking chair closer to the fire there was something there she told herself lurking away in the childs mind she didnt like to think about what it was but she remembered what had happened to the wolves and all that about lighting fires with magic wizards did that it was one of the first things they learned granny sighed there was only one way to be sure and she was getting rather old for this sort of thing she picked up the candle and went out through the scullery into the leanto that housed her goats they watched her without fear each sitting in its pen like a furry blob three mouths working rhythmically on the days hay the air smelled warm and slightly flatulent up in the rafters was a small owl one of a number of creatures who found that living with granny was worth the occasional inconvenience it came to her hand at a word and she stroked its bullet head thoughtfully as she looked for somewhere comfortable to lie a pile of hay it would have to be she blew out the candle and lay back with the owl perched on her finger the goats chewed burped and swallowed their way through their cozy night they made the only sound in the building grannys body stilled the owl felt her enter its mind and graciously made room granny knew she would regret this borrowing twice in one day would leave her good for nothing in the morning and with a terrible desire to eat mice of course when she was younger she thought nothing of it running with the stags hunting with the foxes learning the strange dark ways of the moles hardly spending a night in her own body but it was getting harder now especially coming back maybe the time would come when she couldnt get back maybe the body back home would be so much dead flesh and maybe that wouldnt be such a bad way of it at that this was the sort of thing wizards could never know if it occurred to them to enter a creatures mind theyd do it like a thief not out of wickedness but because it simply wouldnt occur to them to do it any other way the daft buggers and what good would it do to take over an owls body you couldnt fly you needed to spend a lifetime learning but the gentle way was to ride in its mind steering it as gently as a breeze stirs a leaf the owl stirred fluttered up on to the little windowsill and glided silently into the night the clouds had cleared and the thin moon made the mountains gleam granny peered out through owl eyes as she sped silently between the ranks of trees this was the only way to travel once a body had the way of it she liked borrowing birds best of all using them to explore the high hidden valleys where no one went the secret lakes between black cliffs the tiny walled fields on the scraps of flat ground tucked on the sheer rock faces that were the property of hidden and secretive beings once she had ridden with the geese that passed over the mountains every spring and autumn and had got the shock of her life when she nearly went beyond range of returning the owl broke out of the forest and skimmed across the rooftops of the village alighting in a shower of snow on the biggest apple tree in smiths orchard it was heavy with mistletoe she knew she was right as soon as her claws touched the bark the tree resented her she could feel it trying to push her away im not going she thought in the silence of the night the tree said bully me then just because im a tree typical woman at least youre useful now thought granny better a tree than a wizard eh its not such a bad life thought the tree sun fresh air time to think bees too in the spring there was something lascivious about the way the tree said bees that quite put granny who had several hives off the idea of honey it was like being reminded that eggs were unborn chickens ive come about the girl esk she hissed a promising child thought the tree im watching her with interest she likes apples too you beast said granny shocked what did i say pardon me for not breathing im sure granny sidled closer to the trunk you must let her go she thought the magic is starting to come through already im impressed said the tree its the wrong sort of magic screeched granny its wizard magic not womens magic she doesnt know what it is yet but it killed a dozen wolves tonight great said the tree granny hooted with rage great supposing she had been arguing with her brothers and lost her temper eh the tree shrugged snowflakes cascaded from its branches then you must train her it said train what do i know from training wizards then send her to university shes female hooted granny bouncing up and down on her branch well who says women cant be wizards granny hesitated the tree might as well have asked why fish couldnt be birds she drew a deep breath and started to speak and stopped she knew a cutting incisive withering and above all a selfevident answer existed it was just that to her extreme annoyance she couldnt quite bring it to mind women have never been wizards its against nature you might as well say that witches can be men if you define a witch as one who worships the pancreative urge that is venerates the basic the tree began and continued for several minutes granny weatherwax listened in impatient annoyance to phrases like mother goddesses and primitive moon worship and told herself that she was well aware of what being a witch was all about it was about herbs and curses and flying around of nights and generally keeping on the right side of tradition and it certainly didnt involve mixing with goddesses mothers or otherwise who apparently got up to some very questionable tricks and when the tree started talking about dancing naked she tried not to listen because although she was aware that somewhere under her complicated strata of vests and petticoats there was some skin that didnt mean to say she approved of it the tree finished its monologue granny waited until she was quite sure that it wasnt going to add anything and said thats witchcraft is it its theoretical basis yes you wizards certainly get some funny ideas the tree said not a wizard anymore just a tree granny ruffled her feathers well just you listen to me mr socalled theoretical basis tree if women were meant to be wizards theyd be able to grow long white beards and she is not going to be a wizard is that quite clear wizardry is not the way to use magic do you hear its nothing but lights and fire and meddling with power and shell be having no part of it and good night to you the owl swooped away from the branch it was only because it would interfere with the flying that granny wasnt shaking with rage wizards they talked too much and pinned spells down in books like butterflies but worst of all they thought theirs was the only magic worth practicing granny was absolutely certain of one thing women had never been wizards and they werent about to start now she arrived back at the cottage in the pale shank of the night her body at least was rested after its slumber in the hay and granny had hoped to spend a few hours in the rocking chair putting her thoughts in order this was the time when night wasnt quite over but day hadnt quite begun when thoughts stood out bright and clear and without disguise she the staff was leaning against the wall by the dresser granny stood quite still i see she said at last so thats the way of it is it in my own house too moving very slowly she walked over to the inglenook threw a couple of split logs on to the embers of the fire and pumped the bellows until the flames roared up the chimney when she was satisfied she turned muttered a few precautionary protective spells under her breath and grabbed the staff it didnt resist she nearly fell over but now she had it in her hands and felt the tingle of it the distinctive thunderstorm crackle of the magic in it and she laughed it was as simple as this then there was no fight in it now calling down a curse upon wizards and all their works she raised the staff above her head and brought it down with a clang across the firedogs over the hottest part of the fire esk screamed the sound bounced down through the bedroom floorboards and scythed through the dark cottage granny was old and tired and not entirely clear about things after a long day but to survive as a witch requires an ability to jump to very large conclusions and as she stared at the staff in the flames and heard the scream her hands were already reaching for the big black kettle she upended it over the fire dragged the staff out of the cloud of steam and ran upstairs dreading what she might see esk was sitting up in the narrow bed unsinged but shrieking granny took the child in her arms and tried to comfort her she wasnt sure how one went about it but a distracted patting on the back and vague reassuring noises seemed to work and the screams became wails and eventually sobs here and there granny could pick out words like fire and hot and her mouth set in a thin bitter line finally she settled the child down tucked her in and crept quietly down stairs the staff was back against the wall she was not surprised to see that the fire hadnt marked it at all granny turned her rocking chair to face it and sat down with her chin in her hand and an expression of grim determination presently the chair began to rock of its own accord it was the only sound in a silence that thickened and spread and filled the room like a terrible dark fog next morning before esk got up granny hid the staff in the thatch well out of harms way esk ate her breakfast and drank a pint of goats milk without the least sign of the events of the last twentyfour hours it was the first time she had been inside grannys cottage for more than a brief visit and while the old woman washed the dishes and milked the goats she made the most of her implied license to explore she found that life in the cottage wasnt entirely straightforward there was the matter of the goats names for example but theyve got to have names she said everythings got a name granny looked at her around the pearshaped flanks of the head nanny while the milk squirted into the low pail i daresay theyve got names in goat she said vaguely what do they want names in human for well said esk and stopped she thought for a bit how do you make them do what you want then they just do and when they want me they holler esk gravely gave the head goat a wisp of hay granny watched her thoughtfully goats did have names for themselves she well knew there was goat who is my kid goat who is my mother goat who is herd leader and half a dozen other names not least of which was goat who is this goat they had a complicated herd system and four stomachs and a digestive system that sounded very busy on still nights and granny had always felt that calling all this names like buttercup was an insult to a noble animal esk she said making up her mind yes what would you like to be when you grow up esk looked blank dont know well said granny her hands still milking what do you think you will do when you are grown up dont know get married i suppose do you want to esks lips started to shape themselves around the d but she caught grannys eye and stopped and thought all the grown ups i know are married she said at last and thought some more except you she added cautiously thats true said granny didnt you want to get married it was grannys turn to think never got around to it she said at last too many other things to do you see father says youre a witch said esk chancing her arm i am that esk nodded in the ramtops witches were accorded a status similar to that which other cultures gave to nuns or tax collectors or cesspit cleaners that is to say they were respected sometimes admired generally applauded for doing a job which logically had to bedone but people never felt quite comfortable in the same room with them granny said would you like to learn the witching magic you mean asked esk her eyes lighting up yes magic but not firework magic real magic can you fly theres better things than flying and i can learn them if your parents say yes esk sighed my father wont then i shall have a word with him said granny now you just listen to me gordo smith smith backed away across his forge hands halfraised to ward off the old womans fury she advanced on him one finger stabbing the air righteously i brought you into the world you stupid man and youve got no more sense in you now than you had then but smith tried dodging around the anvil the magics found her wizard magic wrong magic do you understand it was never intended for her yes but have you any idea of what it can do smith sagged no granny paused and deflated a little no she repeated more softly no you wouldnt she sat down on the anvil and tried to think calm thoughts look magic has a sort of life of its own that doesnt matter because anyway you see wizard magic she looked up at his big blank expression and tried again well you know cider smith nodded he felt he was on firmer ground here but he wasnt certain of where it was going to lead and then theres the ticker applejack said the witch the smith nodded everyone in bad ass made applejack in the winter by leaving cider tubs outside overnight and taking out the ice until a tiny core of alcohol was left well you can drink lots of cider and you just feel better and thats it isnt it the smith nodded again but applejack you drink that in little mugs and you dont drink a lot and you dont drink it often because it goes right to your head the smith nodded again and aware that he wasnt making a major contribution to the dialogue added thats right thats the difference said granny the difference from what granny sighed the difference between witch magic and wizard magic she said and its found her and if she doesnt control it then there are those who will control her magic can be a sort of door and there are unpleasant things on the other side do you understand the smith nodded he didnt really understand but he correctly surmised that if he revealed this fact granny would start going into horrible details shes strong in her mind and it might take a while said granny but sooner or later theyll challenge her smith picked up a hammer from his bench looked at it as though he had never seen it before and put it down again but he said if its wizard magic shes got learning witchery wont be any good will it you said theyre different theyre both magic if you cant learn to ride an elephant you can at least learn to ride a horse whats an elephant a kind of badger said granny she hadnt maintained forest credibility for forty years by ever admitting ignorance the blacksmith sighed he knew he was beaten his wife had made it clear that she favored the idea and now that he came to think about it there were some advantages after all granny wouldnt last forever and being father to the areas only witch might not be too bad at that all right he said and so as the winter turned and started the long reluctant climb towards spring esk spent days at a time with granny weatherwax learning witch craft it seemed to consist mainly of things to remember the lessons were quite practical there was cleaning the kitchen table and basic herbalism there was mucking out the goats and the uses of fungi there was doing the washing and the summoning of the small gods and there was always tending the big copper still in the scullery and the theory and practice of distillation by the time the warm rim winds were blowing and the snow remained only as little streaks of slush on the hub side of trees esk knew how to prepare a range of ointments several medicinal brandies a score of special infusions and a number of mysterious potions that granny said she might learn the use of in good time what she hadnt done was any magic at all all in good time repeated granny vaguely but im supposed to be a witch youre not a witch yet name me three herbs good for the bowels esk put her hands behind her back closed her eyes and said the flowering tops of greater peahane the root pith of old mans trousers the stems of the bloodwater lily the seedcases of all right where may water gherkins be found peat bogs and stagnant pools from the months of good youre learning but its not magic granny sat down at the kitchen table most magic isnt she said its just knowing the right herbs and learning to watch the weather and finding out the ways of animals and the ways of people too thats all it is said esk horrified all its a pretty big all said granny but no it isnt all theres other stuff cant you teach me all in good time theres no call to go showing yourself yet showing myself who to grannys eyes darted towards the shadows in the corners of the room never you mind then even the last lingering tails of snow had gone and the spring gales roared around the mountains the air in the forest began to smell of leaf mould and turpentine a few early flowers braved the night frosts and the bees started to fly now bees said granny weatherwax is real magic she carefully lifted the lid of the first hive your bees she went on is your mead your wax your bee gum your honey a wonderful thing is your bee ruled by a queen too she added with a touch of approval dont they sting you said esk standing back a little bees boiled out of the comb and overflowed the rough wooden sides of the box hardly ever said granny you wanted magic watch she put a hand into the struggling mass of insects and made a shrill faint piping noise at the back of her throat there was a movement in the mass and a large bee longer and fatter than the others crawled on to her hand a few workers followed it stroking it and generally ministering to it how did you do that said esk ah said granny wouldnt you like to know yes i would thats why i asked granny said esk severely do you think i used magic esk looked down at the queen bee she looked up at the witch no she said i think you just know a lot about bees granny grinned exactly correct thats one form of magic of course what just knowing things knowing things that other people dont know said granny she carefully dropped the queen back among her subjects and closed the lid of the hive and i think its time you learned a few secrets she added at last thought esk but first we must pay our respects to the hive said granny she managed to sound the capital h without thinking esk bobbed a curtsey grannys hand clipped the back of her head bow i told you she said without rancor witches bow she demonstrated but why complained esk because witches have got to be different and thats part of the secret said granny they sat on a bleached bench in front of the rimward wall of the cottage in front of them the herbs were already a foot high a sinister collection of pale green leaves right said granny settling herself down you know the hat on the hook by the door go and fetch it esk obediently went inside and unhooked grannys hat it was tall pointed and of course black granny turned it over in her hands and regarded it carefully inside this hat she said solemnly is one of the secrets of witchcraft if you cannot tell me what it is then i might as well teach you no more because once you learn the secret of the hat there is no going back tell me what you know about the hat can i hold it be my guest esk peered inside the hat there was some wire stiffening to give it a shape and a couple of hatpins that was all there was nothing particularly strange about it except that no one in the village had one like it but that didnt make it magical esk bit her lip she had a vision of herself being sent home in disgrace it didnt feel strange and there were no hidden pockets it was just a typical witchs hat granny always wore it when she went into the village but in the forest she just wore a leather hood she tried to recall the bits of lessons that granny grudgingly doled out it isnt what you know its what other people dont know magic can be something right in the wrong place or something wrong in the right place it can be granny always wore it to the village and the big black cloak which certainly wasnt magical because for most of the winter it had been a goat blanket and granny washed it in the spring esk began to feel the shape of the answer and she didnt like it much it was like a lot of grannys answers just a word trick she just said things you knew all the time but in a different way so they sounded important i think i know she said at last out with it then its in sort of two parts well its a witchs hat because you wear it but youre a witch because you wear the hat um so prompted granny so people see you coming in the hat and the cloak and they know youre a witch and thats why your magic works said esk thats right said granny its called headology she tapped her silver hair which was drawn into a tight bun that could crack rocks but its not real esk protested thats not magic its its listen said granny if you give someone a bottle of red jollop for their wind it may work right but if you want it to work for sure then you let their mind make it work for them tell em its moonbeams bottled in fairy wine or something mumble over it a bit its the same with cursing cursing said esk weakly aye cursing my girl and no need to look so shocked youll curse when the need comes when youre alone and theres no help to hand and she hesitated and uncomfortably aware of esks questioning eyes finished lamely and people arent showing respect make it loud make it complicated make it long and make it up if you have to but itll work all right next day when they hit their thumb or they fall off a ladder or their dog drops dead theyll remember you theyll behave better next time but it still doesnt seem like magic said esk scuffing the dust with her feet i saved a mans life once said granny special medicine twice a day boiled water with a bit of berry juice in it told him id bought it from the dwarves thats the biggest part of doctrin really most peoplell get over most things if they put their minds to it you just have to give them an interest she patted esks hand as nicely as possible youre a bit young for this she said but as you grow older youll find most people dont set foot outside their own heads much you too she added gnomically i dont understand id be very surprised if you did said granny briskly but you can tell me five herbs suitable for dry coughs spring began to unfold in earnest granny started taking esk on long walks that took all day to hidden ponds or high on to the mountain scree to collect rare plants esk enjoyed that high on the hills where the sun beat down strongly but the air was nevertheless freezing cold plants grew thickly and hugged the ground from some of the highest peaks she could see all the way to the rim ocean that ran around the edge of the world in the other direction the ramtops marched into the distance wrapped in eternal winter they went all the way to the hub of the world where it was generally agreed the gods lived on a tenmile high mountain of rock and ice gods are all right said granny as they ate their lunch and looked at the view you dont bother gods and gods dont come bothering you do you know many gods ive seen the thundergods a few times said granny and hoki of course hold granny chewed a crustless sandwich oh hes a nature god she said sometimes he manifests himself as an oak tree or half a man and half a goat but mainly i see him in his aspect as a bloody nuisance you only find him in the deep woods of course he plays the flute very badly if you must know esk lay on her stomach and looked out across the lands below while a few hardy selfemployed bumblebees patrolled the thyme clusters the sun was warm on her back but up here there were still drifts of snow on the hubside of rocks tell me about the lands down there she said lazily granny peered disapprovingly at ten thousand miles of landscape theyre just other places she said just like here only different are there cities and things idaresay havent you ever been to look granny sat back gingerly arranging her skirt to expose several inches of respectable flannelette to the sun and let the heat caress her old bones no she said theres quite enough troubles around here without going to look for them in forn parts i dreamed of a city once said esk it had hundreds of people in it and there was this building with big gates and they were magical gates a sound like tearing cloth came from behind her granny had fallen asleep granny mhnf esk thought for a moment are you having a good time she said artfully mnph you said youd show me some real magic all in good time said esk and this is a good time mnph granny weatherwax opened her eyes and looked straight up at the sky it was darker up here more purple than blue she thought why not shes a quick learner she knows more herblore than i do at her age old gammer tumult had me borrowing and shifting and sending all the hours of the day maybe im being too cautious just a bit pleaded esk granny turned it over in her mind she couldnt think of any more excuses im surely going to regret this she told herself displaying considerable foresight all right she said shortly real magic said esk not more herbs or headology real magic as you call it yes a spell no a borrowing esks face was a picture of expectation she looked more alive it seemed to granny than she had ever been before granny looked over the valleys stretching out before them until she found what she was after a grey eagle was circling lazily over a distant bluehazed patch of forest its mind was currently at ease it would do nicely she called it gently and it began to circle towards them the first thing to remember about borrowing is that you must be comfortable and somewhere safe she said smoothing out the grass behind her beds best but what is borrowing lie down and hold my hand do you see the eagle up there esk squinted into the dark hot sky there were two doll figures on the grass below as she pivoted on the wind she could feel the whip and wire of the air through her feathers because the eagle was not hunting but simply enjoying the feel of the sun on its wings the land below was a mere unimportant shape but the air the air was a complex changing threedimensional thing an interlocked pattern of spirals and curves that stretched away into the distance a switchback of currents built around thermal pillars she felt a gentle pressure restraining her the next thing to remember said grannys voice very close is not to upset the owner if you let it know youre there itll either fight you or panic and you wont stand a chance either way its had a lifetime of being an eagle and you havent esk said nothing youre not frightened are you said granny it can take you that way the first time and im not frightened said esk and how do i control it you dont not yet anyway controlling a truly wild creature isnt easily learned you have to sort of suggest to it that it might feel inclined to do things with a tame animal of course its all different but you cant make any creature do anything that is totally against its nature now try and find the eagles mind esk could sense granny as a diffuse silver cloud at the back of her own mind after some searching she found the eagle she almost missed it its mind was small sharp and purple like an arrowhead it was concentrating entirely on flying and took no notice of her good said granny approvingly were not going to go far if you want to make it turn you must yes yes said esk she flexed her fingers wherever they were and the bird leaned against the air and turned very good said granny taken aback how did you do that i dont know it just seemed obvious hmph granny gently tested the tiny eagle mind it was still totally oblivious of its passengers she was genuinely impressed a very rare occurrence they floated over the mountain while esk excitedly explored the eagles senses grannys voice droned through her consciousness giving instructions and guidance and warnings she listened with half an ear it sounded far too complicated why couldnt she take over the eagles mind it wouldnt hurt it she could see how to do it it was just a knack like snapping your fingers which in fact she had never managed to achieve and then shed be able to experience flying for real not at second hand then she could dont said granny calmly no good will come of it what do you really think youre the first my girl do you think we havent all thought what a fine thing it would be to take on another body and tread the wind or breathe the water and do you really think it would be as easy as that esk glowered at her no need to look like that said granny youll thank me one day dont you start playing around before you know what youre about eh before you get up to tricks youve got to learn what to do if things go wrong dont try to walk before you can run i can feel how to do it granny thats as maybe its harder than it seems is borrowing although ill grant youve got a knack thats enough for today bring us in over ourselves and ill show you how to return the eagle beat the air over the two recumbent forms and esk saw in her minds eye two channels open for them grannys mindshape vanished now granny had been wrong the eagle mind barely fought and didnt have time to panic esk held it wrapped in her own mind it writhed for an instant and then melted into leer granny opened her eyes in time to see the bird give a hoarse cry of triumph curve down low over the grassgrown scree and skim away down the mountainside for a moment it was a vanishing dot and then it had gone leaving only another echoing shriek granny looked down at esks silent form the girl was light enough but it was a long way home and the afternoon was dwindling drat she said with no particular emphasis she stood up brushed herself down and with a grunt of effort hauled esks inert body over her shoulder high in the crystal sunset air above the mountains the eagle esk sought more height drunk with the sheer vitality of flight on the way home granny met a hungry bear grannys back was giving her gyp and she was in no mood to be growled at she muttered a few words under her breath and the bear to its brief amazement walked heavily into a tree and didnt regain consciousness for several hours when she reached the cottage granny put esks body to bed and drew up the fire she brought the goats in and milked them and finished the chores of the evening she made sure all the windows were open and when it began to grow dark lit a lantern and put it on the windowsill granny weatherwax didnt sleep more than a few hours a night as a rule and woke again at midnight the room hadnt changed although the lantern had its own little solar system of very stupid moths when she woke again at dawn the candle had long burned down and esk was still sleeping the shallow unwakable sleep of the borrower when she took the goats out to their paddock she looked intently at the sky noon came and gradually the light drained out of another day she paced the floor of the kitchen aimlessly occasionally she would throw herself into frantic bouts of housework ancient crusts were unceremoniously dug out of the cracks in the flagstones and the fireback was scraped free of the winters soot and blackleaded to within an inch of its life a nest of mice in the back of the dresser were kindly but firmly ejected into the goatshed sunset came the light of the discworld was old and slow and heavy from the cottage door granny watched as it drained off the mountains flowing in golden rivers through the forest here and there it pooled in hollows until it faded and vanished she drummed her fingers sharply on the doorpost humming a small and bitter little tune dawn came and the cottage was empty except for esks body silent and unmoving on the bed but as the golden light flowed slowly across the discworld like the first freshing of the tide over mudflats the eagle circled higher into the dome of heaven beating the air down with slow and powerful wingbeats the whole of the world was spread out beneath esk all the continents all the islands all the rivers and especially the great ring of the rim ocean there was nothing else up here not even sound esk gloried in the feel of it willing her flagging muscles into greater effort but something was wrong her thoughts seemed to be chasing around beyond her control and disappearing pain and exhilaration and weariness poured into her mind but it was as if other things were spilling out at the same time memories dwindled away on the wind as fast as she could latch on to a thought it evaporated leaving nothing behind she was losing chunks of herself and she couldnt remember what she was losing she panicked burrowing back to the things she was sure of i am esk and i have stolen the body of an eagle and the feel of wind in feathers the hunger the search of the notsky below she tried again i am esk and seeking the windpath the pain of muscle the cut of the air the cold of it i am esk high over airdampwetwhite above everything the sky is thin i am i am granny was in the garden among the beehives the early morning wind whipping at her skirts she went from hive to hive tapping on their roofs then in the thickets of borage and beebalm that she had planted around them she stood with her arms outstretched in front of her and sang something in tones so high that no normal person could have heard them but a roar went up from the hives and then the air was suddenly thick with the heavy bigeyed deepvoiced shapes of drone bees they circled over her head adding their own bass humming to her chant then they were gone soaring into the growing light over the clearing and streaming away over the trees it is well known at least it is well known to witches that all colonies of bees are as it were just one part of the creature called the swarm in the same way that individual bees are component cells of the hivemind granny didnt mingle her thoughts with the bees very often partly because insect minds were strange alien things that tasted of tin but mostly because she suspected that the swarm was a good deal more intelligent than she was she knew that the drones would soon reach the wild bee colonies in the deep forest and within hours every corner of the mountain meadows would be under very close scrutiny indeed all she could do was wait at noon the drones returned and granny read in the sharp acid thoughts of the hivemind that there was no sign of esk she went back into the cool of the cottage and sat down in the rocking chair staring at the doorway she knew what the next step was she hated the very idea of it but she fetched a short ladder climbed up creakily on to the roof and pulled the staff from its hiding place in the thatch it was icy cold it steamed above the snowline then said granny she climbed down and rammed the staff into a flowerbed she glared at it she had a nasty feeling that it was glaring back dont think youve won because you havent she snapped its just that i havent got the time to mess around you must know where she is i command you to take me to her the staff regarded her woodenly by granny paused her invocations were a little rusty by stock and stone i order it activity movement liveliness all these words would be completely inaccurate descriptions of the staffs response granny scratched her chin she remembered the little lesson all children get taught whats the magic word please she suggested the staff trembled rose a little way out of the ground and turned in the air so that it hung invitingly at waist height granny had heard that broomsticks were once again very much the fashion among younger witches but she didnt hold with it there was no way a body could look respectable while hurtling through the air aboard a household implement besides it looked decidedly draughty but this was no time for respectability pausing only to snatch her hat from its hook behind the door she scrambled up on to the staff and perched as best she could sidesaddle of course and with her skirts firmly gripped between her knees right she said now whaaaaaaaaaa across the forest animals broke and scattered as the shadow passed overhead crying and cursing granny clung on with whitened knuckles her thin legs kicking wildly as high above the treetops she learned important lessons about centres of gravity and air turbulence the staff shot onwards heedless of her yells by the time it had come out over the upland meadows she had come to terms with it somewhat which meant that she could just about hang on with knees and hands provided she didnt mind being upside down her hat at least was useful being aerodynamically shaped the staff plunged between black cliffs and along high bare valleys where it was said rivers of ice had once flowed in the days of the ice giants the air became thin and sharp in the throat they came to an abrupt halt over a snowdrift granny fell off and lay panting in the snow while she tried to remember why she was going through all this there was a bundle of feathers under an overhang a few feet away as granny approached it a head rose jerkily and the eagle glared at her with fierce frightened eyes it tried to fly and toppled over when she reached out to touch it it took a neat triangle of flesh out of her hand i see said granny quietly to no one in particular she looked around and found a boulder of about the right size she disappeared behind it for a few seconds fox the sake of respectability and reappeared with a petticoat in her hand the bird thrashed around ruining several weeks of meticulous petitpoint embroidery but she managed to bundle it up and hold it so that she could avoid its sporadic lunges granny turned to the staff which was now upright in the snowdrift i shall walk back she told it coldly it turned out that they were in a spur valley overlooking a drop of several hundred feet on to sharp black rocks very well then she conceded but youre to fly slowly dyou understand and no going high in fact because she was slightly more experienced and perhaps because the staff was taking more care too the ride back was almost sedate granny was almost persuaded that given time she could come to merely dislike flying instead of loathing it what it needed was some way of stopping yourself from having to look at the ground the eagle sprawled on the rag rug in front of the empty hearth it had drunk some water over which granny had mumbled a few of the charms she normally said to impress patients but you never knew there might be some power in them and it had also gulped a few strips of raw meat what it had not done was display the least sign of intelligence she wondered whether she had the right bird she risked another pecking and stared hard into its evil orange eyes and tried to convince herself that way down in their depths almost beyond sight was a strange little flicker she probed around inside its head the eagle mind was still there right enough vivid and sharp but there was something else mind of course has no colour but nevertheless the strands of the eagles mind seemed to be purple around them and tangled among them were faint strands of silver esk had learned too late that mind shapes body that borrowing is one thing but that the dream of truly taking on another form had its builtin penalty granny sat and rocked she was at a loss she knew that unravelling the tangled minds was beyond her power beyond any power in the ramtops beyond even there was no sound but maybe there was a change in the texture of the air she looked up at the staff which had been suffered to come back into the cottage no she said firmly then she thought whose benefit did i say that for mine theres power there but its not my kind of power there isnt any other kind around though and even now i may be too late i might never have been early enough she reached out again into the birds head to calm its fears and dispel its panic it allowed her to pick it up and sat awkwardly on her wrist its talons gripping tight enough to draw blood granny took the staff and made her way upstairs to where esk lay on the narrow bed in the low bedroom with its ancient contoured ceiling she made the bird perch on the bedrail and turned her attention to the staff once more the carvings shifted under her glare never quite revealing their true form granny was no stranger to the uses of power but she knew she relied on gentle pressure subtly to steer the tide of things she didnt put it like that of course she would have said that there was always a lever if you knew where to look the power in the staff was harsh fierce the raw stuff of magic distilled out of the forces that powered the universe itself there would be a price and granny knew enough about wizardry to be certain that it would be a high one but if you were worried about the price then why were you in the shop she cleared her throat and wondered what the hell she was supposed to do next perhaps if she the power hit her like a halfbrick she could feel it take her and lift her so that she was amazed to look down and see her feet still firmly on the floorboards she tried to take a step forward and magical discharges crackled in the air around her she reached out to steady herself against the wall and the ancient wooden beam under her hand stirred and started to sprout leaves a cyclone of magic swirled around the room picking up dust and briefly giving it some very disturbing shapes the jug and basin on the washstand with the particularly fetching rosebud pattern broke into fragments under the bed the third member of the traditional china trio turned into something horrible and slunk away granny opened her mouth to swear and thought better of it when her words blossomed out into rainbowedged clouds she looked down at esk and the eagle which seemed oblivious to all this and tried to concentrate she let herself slide inside its head and again she could see the strands of mind the silver threads bound so closely around the purple that they took on the same shape but now she could see where the strands ended and where a judicious tug or push would begin to unravel them it was so obvious she heard herself laugh and the sound curved away in shades of orange and red and vanished into the ceiling time passed even with the power throbbing through hey head it was a painfully hard task like threading a needle by moonlight but eventually she had a handful of silver in the slow heavy world in which she now appeared to be she took the hank and threw it slowly towards esk it became a cloud swirled like a whirlpool and vanished she was aware of a shrill chittering noise and shadows on the edge of sight well it happened to everyone sooner or later they had come drawn as always by a discharge of magic you just had to learn to ignore them granny woke with bright sunlight skewering into her eyes she was slumped against the door and her whole body felt as though it had toothache she reached out blindly with one hand found the edge of the washstand and pulled herself into a sitting position she was not really surprised to see that the jug and basin looked just the same as they had always done in fact sheer curiosity overcame her aches and she gave a quick glance under the bed to check that yes things were as normal the eagle was still hunched on the bedpost in the bed esk was asleep and granny saw that it was a true sleep and not the stillness of a vacant body all she had to do now was hope that esk wouldnt wake up with an irresistible urge to pounce on rabbits she carried the unresisting bird downstairs and let it free outside the back door it flew heavily up into the nearest tree where it settled to rest it had a feeling it ought to have a grudge against somebody but for the life of it it couldnt remember why esk opened her eyes and stared for a long time at the ceiling over the months she had grown familiar with every lump and crack of the plaster which created a fantastic upsidedown landscape that she had peopled with a private and complex civilization her mind thronged with dreams she pulled an arm out from under the sheets and stared at it wondering why it wasnt covered with feathers it was all very puzzling she pushed the covers back swung her legs to the edge of the bed spread her wings into the rush of the wind and glided out into the world the thump on the bedroom floor brought granny scurrying up the stairs to take her in her arms and hold her tight as the terror hit her she rocked back and forth on her heels making meaningless soothing noises esk looked up at her through a mask of horror i could feel myself vanishing yes yes better now murmured granny you dont understand i couldnt even remember my name esk shrieked but you can remember now esk hesitated checking yes she said yes of course now so no harm done but granny sighed you have learned something she said and thought it safe to insert a touch of sternness into her voice they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing but it is not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance but what happened you thought that borrowing wasnt enough you thought it would be a fine thing to steal anothers body but you must know that a body is like like a jelly mould it sets a shape on its contents dyou see you cant have a girls mind in an eagles body not for long at any rate i became an eagle yes not meat all granny thought for a while she always had to pause when conversations with esk led her beyond the reaches of a decent persons vocabulary no she said at last not in the way you mean just an eagle with maybe some strange dreams sometimes like when you dream youre flying perhaps it would remember walking and talking urgh but its all over now said granny treating her to a thin smile youre your true self again and the eagle has got its mind back its sitting in the big beech by the privy i should like you to put out some food for it esk sat back on her heels staring at a point past grannys head there were some strange things she said conversationally granny spun around i meant in a sort of dream i saw things said esk the old womans shock was so visible that she hesitated frightened that she had said something wrong what kind of things said granny flatly sort of big creatures all sorts of shapes just sitting around was it dark i mean these things were they in the dark there were stars i think granny granny weatherwax was staring at the wall granny esk repeated mmph yes oh granny shook herself yes i see now i would like you to go downstairs and get the bacon that is in the pantry and put it out for the bird do you understand it would be a good idea to thank it too you never know when esk returned granny was buttering bread she pulled her stool up to the table but the old woman waved the breadknife at her first things first stand up face me esk did so puzzled granny stuck the knife in the breadboard and shook her head drat it she said to the world at large i dont know what way they have of it there should be some kind of ceremony if i know wizards they always have to complicate things what do you mean granny seemed to ignore her but crossed to the dark corner by the dresser probably you should have one foot in a bucket of cold porridge and one glove on and all that kind of stuff she went on i didnt want to do this but theyre forcing my hand what are you talking about granny the old witch yanked the staff out of its shadow and waved it vaguely at esk here its yours take it i just hope this is the right thing to do in fact the presentation of a staff to an apprentice wizard is usually a very impressive ceremony especially if the staff has been inherited from an elder wage by ancient lore there is a long and frightening ordeal involving masks and hoods and swords and fearful oaths about peoples tongues being cut out and their entrails torn by wild birds and their ashes scattered to the eight winds and so on after some hours of this sort of thing the apprentice can be admitted to the brotherhood of the wise and enlightened there is also a long speech by sheer coincidence granny got the essence of it in a nutshell esk took the staff and peered at it its very nice she said uncertainly the carvings are pretty whats it for sit down now and listen properly for once on the day you were born and thats the shape of it esk looked hard at the staff then at granny ive got to be a wizard yes no i dont know that isnt really an answer granny esk said reproachfully am i or arent i women cant be wizards said granny bluntly its agin nature you might as well have a female blacksmith actually ive watched dad at work and i dont see why look said granny hurriedly you cant have a female wizard any more than you can have a male witch because ive heard of male witches said esk meekly warlocks i think so i mean theres no male witches only silly men said granny hotly if men were witches theyd be wizards its all down to she tapped her head headology how your mind works mens minds work different from ours see their magics all numbers and angles and edges and what the stars are doing as if that really mattered its all power its all granny paused and dredged up her favourite word to describe all she despised in wizardry jommetry thats all right then said esk relieved ill stay here and learn witchery ali said granny gloomily thats all very well for you to say i dont think it will be as easy as that but you said that men can be wizards and women can be witches and it cant be the other way around thats right well then said esk triumphantly its all solved isnt it i cant help but be a witch granny pointed to the staff esk shrugged its just an old stick granny shook her head esk blinked no no and i cant be a witch i dont know what you can be hold the staff what hold the staff now ive laid the fire in the grate light it the tinderbox is esk began you once told me there were better ways of lighting fires show me granny stood up in the dimness of the kitchen she seemed to grow until she filled it with shifting ragged shadows shot with menace her eyes glared down at esk show me she commanded and her voice had ice in it but said esk desperately clutching the heavy staff to her and knocking her stool over in her haste to back away showme with a scream esk spun around fire flared from her fingertips and arced across the room the kindling exploded with a force that hurled the furniture around the room and a ball of fierce green light spluttered on the hearth changing patterns sped across it as it spun sizzling on the stones which cracked and then flowed the iron fireback resisted bravely for a few seconds before melting like wax it made a final appearance as a red smear across the fireball and then vanished a moment later the kettle went the same way just when it seemed that the chimney would follow them the ancient hearthstone gave up and with a final splutter the fireball sank from view the occasional crackle or puff of steam signaled its passage through the earth apart from that there was silence the loud hissing silence that comes after an earsplattering noise and after the actinic glare the room seemed pitch dark eventually granny crawled out from behind the table and crept as closely as she dared to the hole which was still surrounded by a crust of lava she jerked back as another cloud of superheated steam mushroomed up they say theres dwarf mines under the ramtops she said inconsequentially my but them little buggers is in for a surprise she prodded the little puddle of cooling iron where the kettle had been and added shame about the fireback it had owls on it you know she patted her singed hair gingerly with a shaking hand i think this calls for a nice cup of a nice cup of cold water esk sat looking in wonder at her hand that was real magic she said at last and i did it one type of real magic corrected granny dont forget that and you dont want to do that all the time neither if its in you youve got to learn to control it can you teach me me no how can i learn if no one will teach me youve got to go where they can wizard school but you said granny paused in the act of filling a jug from the water bucket yes yes she snapped never mind what i said or common sense or anything sometimes you just have to go the way things take you and i reckon youre going to wizard school one way or the other esk considered this you mean its my destiny she said at last granny shrugged something like that probably who knows that night long after esk had been sent to bed granny put on her hat lit a fresh candle cleared the table and pulled a small wooden box from its secret hiding place in the dresser it contained a bottle of ink an elderly quill pen and a few sheets of paper granny was not entirely happy when faced with the world of letters her eyes protruded her tongue stuck out small beads of sweat formed on her forehead but the pen scratched its way across the page to the accompaniment of the occasional quiet drat or bugger the thing the letter read as follows although this version lacks the candlewax blots crossingsout and damp patches of the original to then hed blizzard unsene universety greatings i hop you ar well i am sending to you won escarrina smith shee bath thee maekings of wizzardery but whot may be ferther dun wyth hyr i knowe not slice is a gode worker and clene about hyr person allso skilled in diuerse arts of thee howse i will send monies wyth hyr may you liv longe and ende youre days in pese and oblije esmerelder weatherwaxe mss wytch granny held it up to the candlelight and considered it critically it was a good letter she had got diuerse out of the alm anack which she read every night it was always predicting diuerse plagues and diuerse illfortune granny wasnt entirely sure what it meant but it was a damn good word all the same she sealed it with candlewax and put it on the dresser she could leave it for the carrier to take when she went into the village tomorrow to see about a new kettle next morning granny took some pains over her dress selecting a black dress with a frog and bat motif a big velvet cloak or at least a cloak made of the sort of stuff velvet looks like after thirty years of heavy wear and the pointed hat of office which was crucified with hatpins their first call was to the stonemason to order a replacement hearthstone then they called on the smith it was a long and stormy meeting esk wandered out into the orchard and climbed up to her old place in the apple tree while from the house came her fathers shouts her mothers wails and long silent pauses which meant that granny weatherwax was speaking softly in what esk thought of as her just so voice the old woman had a flat measured way of speaking sometimes it was the kind of voice the creator had probably used whether there was magic in it or just headology it ruled out any possibility of argument it made it clear that whatever it was talking about was exactly how things should be the breeze shook the tree gently esk sat on a branch idly swinging her legs she thought about wizards they didnt often come to bad ass but there were a fair number of stories about them they were wise she recalled and usually very old and they did powerful complex and mysterious magics and almost all of them had beards they were also without exception men she was on firmer ground with witches because shed trailed off with granny to visit a couple of villages witches further along the hills and anyway witches figured largely in ramtop folklore witches were cunning she recalled and usually very old or at least they tried to look old and they did slightly suspicious homely and organic magics and some of them had beards they were also without exception women there was some fundamental problem in all that which she couldnt quite resolve why wouldnt cern and gulta hurtled down the path and came to a pushing shoving halt under the tree they peered up at their sister with a mixture of fascination and scorn witches and wizards were objects of awe but sisters werent somehow knowing your own sister was learning to be a witch sort of devalued the whole profession you cant really do spells said cern can you course you cant said gulta whats this stick esk had left the staff leaning against the tree cern prodded it cautiously i dont want you to touch it said esk hurriedly please its mine cern normally had all the sensitivity of a ballbearing but his hand stopped in midprod much to his surprise i didnt want to anyway he muttered to hide his confusion its only an old stick is it true you can do spells asked gulta we heard granny say you could we listened at the door added cern you said i couldnt said esk airily well can you or cant you said gulta his face reddening perhaps you cant esk looked down at his face she loved her brothers when she reminded herself to in a dutiful sort of way although she generally remembered them as a collection of loud noises in trousers but there was something awfully piglike and unpleasant about the way gulta was staring up at her as though she had personally insulted him she felt her body start to tingle and the world suddenly seemed very sharp and clear i can she said gulta looked from her to the staff and his eyes narrowed he kicked it viciously old stick he looked she thought exactly like a small angry pig cerns screams brought granny and his parents first to the back door and then running down the cinder path esk was perched in the fork of the apple tree an expression of dreamy contemplation on her face cern was hiding behind the tree his face a mere rim around a red tonsilvibrating bawl gulta was sitting rather bewildered in a pile of clothing that no longer fitted him wrinkling his snout granny strode up to the tree until her hooked nose was level with esks turning people into pigs is not allowed she hissed even brothers i didnt do it it just happened anyway you must admit its a better shape for him said esk evenly whats going on said smith wheres gulta whats this pig doing here this pig said granny weatherwax is your son there was a sigh from esks mother as she collapsed gently backwards but smith was slightly less unprepared he looked sharply from gulta who had managed to untangle himself from his clothing and was now rooting enthusiastically among the early windfalls to his only daughter she did this yes or it was done through her said granny looking suspiciously at the staff oh smith looked at his fifth son he had to admit that the shape suited him he reached out without looking and fetched the screaming cern a thump on the back of his head can you turn him back again he asked granny spun around and glared the question at esk who shrugged he didnt believe i could do magic she said calmly yes well i think youve made the point said granny and now you will turn him back madam this instant do you hear dont want to he was rude i see esk gazed down defiantly granny glared up sternly their wills clanged like cymbals and the air between them thickened but granny had spent a lifetime bending recalcitrant creatures to her bidding and while esk was a surprisingly strong opponent it was obvious that she would give in before the end of the paragraph oh all right she whined i dont know why anyone would bother turning him into a pig when he was doing such a good job of it all by himself she didnt know where the magic had come from but she mentally faced that way and made a suggestion gulta reappeared naked with an apple in his mouth awts aughtning he said granny spun around on smith now will you believe me she snapped do you really think shes supposed to settle down here and forget all about magic can you imagine her poor husband if she marries but you always said it was impossible for women to be wizards said smith he was actually rather impressed granny weatherwax had never been known to turn anyone into anything never mind that now said granny calming down a bit she needs training she needs to know how to control for pitys sake put some clothes on that child gulta get dressed and stop grizzling said his father and turned back to granny you said there was some sort of teaching place he hazarded the unseen university yes its for training wizards and you know where it is yes lied granny whose grasp of geography was slightly worse than her knowledge of subatomic physics smith looked from her to his daughter who was sulking and theyll make a wizard of her he said granny sighed i dont know what theyll make of her she said and so it was that a week later granny locked the cottage door and hung the key on its nail in the privy the goats had been sent to stay with a sister witch further along the hills who had also promised to keep an eye on the cottage bad ass would just have to manage without a witch for a while granny was vaguely aware that you didnt find the unseen university unless it wanted you to and the only place to start looking was the town of ohulan cutash a sprawl of a hundred or so houses about fifteen miles away it was where you went to once or twice a year if you were a really cosmopolitan bad assian granny had only been once before in her entire life and hadnt approved of it at all it had smelt all wrong shed got lost and she distrusted city folk with their flashy ways they got a lift on the cart that came out periodically with metal for the smithy it was gritty but better than walking especially since granny had packed their few possessions in a large sack she sat on it for safety esk sat cradling the staff and watching the woods go by when they were several miles outside the village she said i thought you told me plants were different in forn parts so they are these trees look just the same granny regarded them disdainfully nothing like as good she said in fact she was already feeling slightly panicky her promise to accompany esk to unseen university had been made without thinking and granny who picked up what little she knew of the rest of the disc from rumour and the pages of her almanack was convinced that they were heading into earthquakes tidal waves plagues and massacres many of them diverse or even worse but she was determined to see it through a witch relied too much on words ever to go back on them she was wearing serviceable black and concealed about her person were a number of hatpins and a breadknife she had hidden their small store of money grudgingly advanced by smith in the mysterious strata of her underwear her skirt pockets jingled with lucky charms and a freshlyforged horseshoe always a potent preventative in time of trouble weighed down her handbag she felt about as ready as she ever would be to face the world the track wound down between the mountains for once the sky was clear the high ramtops standing out crisp and white like the brides of the sky and the many little streams that bordered or crossed the path flowed sluggishly through strands of meadowsweet and gofasterroot by lunchtime they reached the suburb of ohulan and a few minutes later the cart deposited them in the towns main indeed its only square it turned out to be market day granny weatherwax stood uncertainly on the cobbles holding tightly to esks shoulder as the crowd swirled around them she had heard that lewd things could happen to country women who were freshly arrived in big cities and she gripped her handbag until her knuckles whitened if any male stranger had happened to so much as nod at her it would have gone very hard indeed for him esks eyes were sparkling the square was a jigsaw of noise and colour and smell on one side of it were the temples of the discs more demanding deities and weird perfumes drifted out to join with the reeks of commerce in a complex ragrug of fragrances there were stalls filled with enticing curiosities that she itched to investigate granny let the both of them drift with the crowd the stalls were puzzling her as well she peered among them although never for one minute relaxing her vigilance against pickpockets earthquakes and traffickers in the erotic until she spied something vaguely familiar there was a small covered stall black draped and musty that had been wedged into a narrow space between two houses inconspicuous though it was it nevertheless seemed to be doing a very busy trade its customers were mainly women of all ages although she did notice a few men they all had one thing in common though no one approached it directly they all sort of strolled almost past it then suddenly ducked under its shady canopy a moment later and they would be back again hand just darting away from bag or pocket competing for the worlds most nonchalant walk title so effectively that a watcher might actually doubt what he or she had just seen it was quite amazing that a stall so many people didnt know was there should be quite so popular whats in there said esk whats everyone buying medicines said granny firmly there must be a lot of very sick people in towns said esk gravely inside the stall was a mass of velvet shadows and the herbal scent was thick enough to bottle granny poked a few bundles of dry leaves with an expert finger esk pulled away from her and tried to read the scrawled labels on the bottles in front of her she was expert at most of grannys preparations but she didnt recognise anything here the names were quite amusing like tiger oil maidens prayer and husbands helper and one or two of the stoppers smelled like grannys scullery after she had done some of her secret distillations a shape moved in the stalls dim recesses and a brown wrinkled hand slid lightly on to hers can i assist you missy said a cracked voice in tones of syrup of figs is it your fortune you want telling or is it your future you want changing maybe shes with me snapped granny spinning around and your eyes are betraying you hilta goatfounder if you cant tell her age the shape in front of esk bent forward esme weatherwax it asked the very same said granny still selling thunder drops and penny wishes hilta how goes it all the better for seeing you said the shape what brings you down from the mountains esme and this child your assistant perhaps whats it youre selling please asked esk the shape laughed oh things to stop things that shouldnt be and help things that should love it said let me just close up my dears and i will be right with you the shape bustled past esk in a nasal kaleidoscope of fragrances and buttoned up the curtains at the front of the stall then the drapes at the back were thrown up letting in the afternoon sunlight cant stand the dark and fug myself said hilta goatfounder but the customers expect it you know how it is yes esk nodded sagely headology hilts a small fat woman wearing an enormous hat with fruit on it glanced from her to granny and grinned thats the way of it she agreed will you take some tea they sat on bales of unknown herbs in the private corner made by the stall between the angled walls of the houses and drank something fragrant and green out of surprisingly delicate cups unlike granny who dressed like a very respectable raven hilts goatfounder was all lace and shawls and colours and earrings and so many bangles that a mere movement of her arms sounded like a percussion section falling off a cliff but esk could see the likeness it was hard to describe you couldnt imagine them curtseying to anyone so said granny how goes the life the other witch shrugged causing the drummers to lose their grip again just when they had nearly climbed back up like the hurried lover it comes and goe she began and stopped at grannys meaningful glance at esk not bad not bad she amended hurriedly the council have tried to run me out once or twice you know but they all have wives and somehow it never quite happens they say im not the right sort but i say thered be many a family in this town a good deal bigger and poorer if it wasnt for madame goatfounders pennyroyal preventives i know who comes into my shop i do i remember who buys buckeroo drops and shonuff ointment i do life isnt bad and how is it up in your village with the funny name bad ass said esk helpfully she picked a small clay pot off the counter and sniffed at its contents it is well enough conceded granny the handmaidens of nature are ever in demand esk sniffed again at the powder which seemed to be pennyroyal with a base she couldnt quite identify and carefully replaced the lid while the two women exchanged gossip in a kind of feminine code full of eye contact and unspoken adjectives she examined the other exotic potions on display or rather not on display in some strange way they appeared to be artfully halfhidden as if hilts wasnt entirely keen to sell i dont recognise any of these she said half to herself what do they give to people freedom said hilts who had good hearing she turned back to granny how much have you taught her not that much said granny theres power there but what kind im not sure wizard power it might be hilts turned around very slowly and looked esk up and down ah she said that explains the staff i wondered what the bees were talking about well well give me your hand child esk held out her hand hiltas fingers were so heavy with rings it was like dipping into a sack of walnuts granny sat upright radiating disapproval as hilts began to inspect esks palm i really dont think that is necessary she said sternly not between us you do it granny said esk in the village ive seen you and teacups and cards granny shifted uneasily yes well she said its all according you just hold their hand and people do their own fortunetelling but theres no need to go around believing it wed all be in trouble if we went around believing everything the powers that be have many strange qualities and puzzling and varied are the ways in which they make their desires known in this circle of firelight we call the physical world said hilts solemnly she winked at esk well really snapped granny no straight up said hilts its true hmph i see you going upon a long journey said hilts will i meet a tall dark stranger said esk examining her palm granny always says that to women she says no said hilts while granny snorted but it will be a very strange journey youll go a long way while staying in the same place and the direction will be a strange one it will be an exploration you can tell all that from my hand well mainly im just guessing said hilts sitting back and reaching for the teapot the lead drummer who had climbed halfway back fell on to the toiling cymbalists she looked carefully at esk and added a female wizard eh granny is taking me to unseen university said esk hilta raised her eyebrows do you know where it is granny frowned not in so many words she admitted i was hoping you could give me more explicit directions you being more familiar with bricks and things they say it has many doors but the ones in this world are in the city of ankhmorpork said hilta granny looked blank on the circle sea hilta added grannys look of polite enquiry persisted five hundred miles away said hilta oh said granny she stood up and brushed an imaginary speck of dust off her dress wed better be going then she added hilta laughed esk quite liked the sound granny never laughed she merely let the corners of her mouth turn up but hilta laughed like someone who had thought hard about life and had seen the joke start tomorrow anyway she said ive got room at home you can stay with me and tomorrow youll have the light we wouldnt want to presume said granny nonsense why not have a look around while i pack up the stall ohulan was the market town for a wide sprawling countryside and the market day didnt end at sunset instead torches flared at every booth and stall and light blared forth from the open doorways of the inns even the temples put out coloured lamps to attract nocturnal worshippers hilta moved through the crowd like a slim snake through dry grass her entire stall and stock reduced to a surprisingly small bundle on her back and her jewellery rattling like a sackful of flamenco dancers granny stumped along behind her her feet aching from the unaccustomed prodding of the cobbles and esk got lost it took some effort but she managed it it involved ducking between two stalls and then scurrying down a side alley granny had warned her at length about the unspeakable things that lurked in cities which showed that the old woman was lacking in a complete understanding of headology since esk was now determined to see one or two of them for herself in fact since ohulan was quite barbaric and uncivilised the only things that went on after dark to any degree were a little thievery some amateurish trading in the courts of lust and drinking until you fell over or started singing or both according to the standard poetic instructions one should move through a fair like the white swan at evening moves oer the bay but because of certain practical difficulties esk settled for moving through the crowds like a small dodgem car bumping from body to body with the tip of the staff waving a yard above her head it caused some heads to turn and not only because it had hit them wizards occasionally passed through the town and it was the first time anyone had seen one four feet tall with long hair anyone watching closely would have noticed strange things happening as she passed by there was for example the man with three upturned cups who was inviting a small crowd to explore with him the exciting world of chance and probability as it related to the position of a small dried pea he was vaguely aware of a small figure watching him solemnly for a few moments and then a sackful of peas cascaded out of every cup he picked up within seconds he was kneedeep in legumes he was a lot deeper in trouble he suddenly owed everyone a lot of money there was a small and wretched monkey that for years had shuffled vaguely at the end of a chain while its owner played something dreadful on a pipeorgan it suddenly turned narrowed its little red eyes bit its keeper sharply in the leg snapped its chain and had it away over the rooftops with the nights takings in a tin cup history is silent about what they were spent on a boxful of marzipan ducks on a nearby stall came to life and whirred past the stallholder to land quacking happily in the river where by dawn they had all melted thats natural selection for your the stall itself sidled off down an alley and was never seen again esk in fact moved through the fair more like an arsonist moves through a hayfield or a neutron bounces through a reactor poets notwithstanding and the hypothetical watcher could have detected her random passage by tracing the outbreaks of hysteria and violence but like all good catalysts she wasnt actually involved in the processes she initiated and by the time all the nonhypothetical potential watchers took their eyes off them she had been buffeted somewhere else she was also beginning to tire while granny weatherwax approved of night on general principles she certainly didnt hold with promiscuous candlelight if she had any reading to do after dark she generally persuaded the owl to come and sit on the back of her chair and read through its eyes so esk expected to go to bed around sunset and that was long past there was a doorway ahead of her that looked friendly cheerful sounds were sliding out on the yellow light and pooling on the cobbles with the staff still radiating random magic like a demon lighthouse she headed for it weary but determined the landlord of the fiddlers riddle considered himself to be a man of the world and this was right because he was too stupid to be really cruel and too lazy to be really mean and although his body had been around quite a lot his mind had never gone further than the inside of his own head he wasnt used to being addressed by sticks especially when they spoke in a small piping voice and asked for goats milk cautiously aware that everyone in the inn was looking at him and grinning he pulled himself across the bar top until he could see down esk stared up at him look em right in the eye granny had always said focus your power on em stare em out no one can outstare a witch cept a goat of course the landlord whose name was skiller found himself looking directly down at a small child who seemed to be squinting what he said milk said the child still focussing furiously you get it out of goats you know skiller sold only beer which his customers claimed he got out of cats no selfrespecting goat would have endured the smell in the fiddlers riddle we havent got any he said he looked hard at the staff and his eyebrows met conspiratorially over his nose you could have a look said esk skiller eased himself back across the bar partly to avoid the gaze which was causing his eyes to water in sympathy and partly because a horrible suspicion was congealing in his mind even secondrate barmen tend to resonate with the beer they serve and the vibrations coming from the big barrels behind him no longer had the twang of hop and head they were broadcasting an altogether more lactic note he turned a tap experimentally and watched a thin stream of milk curdle in the drip bucket the staff still poked up over the edge of the counter like a periscope he could swear that it was staring at him too dont waste it said a voice youll be grateful for it one day it was the same tone of voice granny used when esk was less than enthusiastic about a plateful of nourishing sallet greens boiled yellow until the last few vitamins gave in but to skillers hypersensitive ears it wasnt an injunction but a prediction he shivered he didnt know where he would have to be to make him grateful for a drink of ancient beer and curdled milk hed rather be dead first perhaps he would be dead first he very carefully wiped a nearly clean mug with his thumb and filled it from the tap he was aware that a large number of his guests were quietly leaving no one liked magic especially n the hands of a woman you never could tell what they might take it into their heads to do next your milk he said adding miss ive got some money esk said granny had always told her always be ready to pay and you wont have to people always like you to feel good about them its all headology no wouldnt dream of it said skiller hastily he leaned over the bar if you could see er your way clear to turning the rest back though not much call for milk in these parts he sidled along a little way esk had leaned the staff against the bar while she drank her milk and it was making him uncomfortable esk looked at him over a moustache of cream i didnt turn it into milk i just knew it would be milk because i wanted milk she said what did you think it was er beer esk thought about this she vaguely remembered trying beer once and it had tasted sort of secondhand but she could recall something which everyone in bad ass reckoned was much better than beer it was one of grannys most guarded recipes it was good for you because there was only fruit in it plus lots of freezing and boiling and careful testing of little drops with a lighted flame granny would put a very small spoonful in her milk if it was a really cold night it had to be a wooden spoon on account of what it did to metal she concentrated she could picture the taste in her mind and with the little skills that she was beginning to accept but couldnt understand she found she could take the taste apart into little coloured shapes skillers thin wife came out of their back room to see why it had all gone so quiet and he waved her into shocked silence as esk stood swaying very slightly with her eyes closed and her lips moving little shapes that you didnt need went back into the great pool of shapes and then you found the extra ones you needed and put them together and then there was a sort of hook thing which meant that they would turn anything suitable into something just like them and then skiller turned very carefully and regarded the barrel behind him the smell of the room had changed he could feel the pure gold sweating gently out of that ancient woodwork with some care he took a small glass from his store under the counter and let a few splashes of the dark golden liquid escape from the tap he looked at it thoughtfully in the lamplight turned the glass around methodically sniffed it a few times and tossed its contents back in one swallow his face remained unchanged although his eyes went moist and his throat wobbled somewhat his wife and esk watched him as a thin beading of sweat broke out on his forehead ten seconds passed and he was obviously out to break some heroic record there may have been steam curling out of his ears but that could have been a rumour his fingers drummed a strange tattoo on the bartop at last he swallowed appeared to reach a decision turned solemnly to esk and said hwarlish finish saaarghs ishghs oorgsh his brow wrinkled as he ran the sentence past his mind again and made a second attempt aargh argh shaah gok he gave up bharrgsh nargh his wife snorted and took the glass out of his unprotesting hand she sniffed it she looked at the barrels all ten of them she met his unsteady eye in a private paradise for two they soundlessly calculated the selling price of six hundred gallons of tripledistilled white mountain peach brandy and ran out of numbers mrs skiller was quicker on the uptake than her husband she bent down and smiled at esk who was too tired to squint back it wasnt a particularly good smile because mrs skiller didnt get much practice how did you get here little girl she said in a voice that suggested gingerbread cottages and the slamming of big stove doors i got lost from granny and wheres granny now dear clang went the oven doors again it was going to be a tough night for all wanderers in metaphorical forests just somewhere i expect would you like to go to sleep in a big feather bed all nice and warm esk looked at her gratefully even while vaguely realizing that the woman had a face just like an eager ferret and nodded youre right its going to take more than a passing woodchopper to sort this out granny meanwhile was two streets away she was also by the standards of other people lost she would not see it like that she knew where she was it was just that everywhere else didnt it has already been mentioned that it is much harder to detect a human mind than say the mind of a fox the human mind seeing this as some kind of a slur wants to know why this is why animal minds are simple and therefore sharp animals never spend time dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits theyve missed the whole panoply of the universe has been neatly expressed to them as things to mate with eat c run away from and d rocks this frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives it a cutting edge where it matters your normal animal in fact never tries to walk and chew gum at the same time the average human on the other hand thinks about all sorts of things around the clock on all sorts of levels with interruptions from dozens of biological calendars and timepieces theres thoughts about to be said and private thoughts and real thoughts and thoughts about thoughts and a whole gamut of subconscious thoughts to a telepath the human head is a din it is a railway terminus with all the tannoys talking at once it is a complete fm waveband and some of those stations arent reputable theyre outlawed pirates on forbidden seas who play latenight records with limbic lyrics granny trying to locate esk by mind magic alone was trying to find a straw in a haystack she was not succeeding but enough blips of sense reached her through the heterodyne wails of a thousand brains all thinking at once to convince her that the world was indeed as silly as she had always believed it was she met hilta at the corner of the street she was carrying her broomstick the better to conduct an aerial search she was distraught not so much as a hint of her said granny have you been down to the river she might have fallen in then shed have just fallen out again anyway she can swim i think shes hiding drat her what are we going to do granny gave her a withering look hilta goatfounder im ashamed of you acting like a cowin do i look worried hilta peered at her you do a bit your lips have gone all thin im just angry thats all gypsies always come here for the fair they might have taken her granny was prepared to believe anything about city folk but here she was on firmer ground then theyre a lot dafter than id give them credit for she snapped look shes got the staff what good would that do said hilta who was close to tears i dont think youve understood anything ive told you said granny severely all we need to do is go back to your place and wait what for the screams or the bangs or the fireballs or whatever granny said vaguely thats heartless oh i expect theyve got it coming to them come on you go on ahead and put the kettle on hilta gave her a mystified look then climbed on her broom and rose slowly and erratically into the shadows among the chimneys if broomsticks were cars this one would be a split window morris minor granny watched her go then stumped along the wet streets after her she was determined that they wouldnt get her up in one of those things esk lay in the big fluffy and slightly damp sheets of the spare bed in the attic room of the riddle she was tired but couldnt sleep the bed was too chilly for one thing she wondered uneasily if she dared try to warm it up but thought better of it she couldnt seem to get the hang of fire spells no matter how carefully she experimented they either didnt work at all or worked only too well the woods around the cottage were becoming treacherous with the holes left by disappearing fireballs at least if the wizardry thing didnt work then granny said shed have a fine future as a privy builder or well sinker she turned over and tried to ignore the beds faint smell of mushrooms then she reached out in the darkness until her hand found the staff propped against the bedhead mrs skiller had been quite insistent about taking it downstairs but esk had hung on like grim death it was the only thing in the world she was absolutely certain belonged to her the varnished surface with its strange carvings felt oddly comforting esk went to sleep and dreamed bangles and strange packages and mountains and distant stars above the mountains and a cold desert where strange creatures lurched across the dry sand and stared at her through insect eyes there was a creak on the stairs then another then a silence the sort of choking furry silence made by someone standing as still as possible the door swung open skiller made a blacker shadow against the candlelight on the stairs and there was a faintly whispered conversation before he tiptoed as silently as he could towards the bedhead the staff slipped sideways as his first cautious grope dislodged it but he caught it quickly and let his breath out very slowly so he hardly had enough left to scream with when the staff moved in his hands he felt the scaliness the coil and muscle of it esk sat bolt upright in time to see skiller roll backwards down the steep stairladder still flailing desperately at something quite invisible that coiled around his arms there was another scream from below as he landed on his wife the staff clattered to the floor and lay surrounded by a faint octarine glow esk got out of the bed and padded across the floor there was a terrible cursing it sounded unhealthy she peered around the door and looked down on the face of mrs skiller give me that staff esk reached down behind her and gripped the polished wood no she said its mine its not the right sort of thing for little girls snapped the barmans wife it belongs to me said esk and quietly closed the door she listened for a moment to the muttering from below and tried to think of what to do next turning the couple into something would probably only cause a fuss and anyway she wasnt quite certain how to do it the fact was the magic only really worked when she wasnt thinking about it her mind seemed to get in the way she padded across the room and pushed open the tiny window the strange nighttime smells of civilization drifted in the damp smell of streets the fragrance of garden flowers the distant hint of an overloaded privy there were wet tiles outside as skiller started back up the stairs she pushed the staff out on to the roof and crawled after it steadying herself on the carvings above the window the roof dipped down to an outhouse and she managed to stay at least vaguely upright as she halfslid halfscrambled down the uneven tiles a sixfoot drop on to a stack of old barrels a quick scramble down the slippery wood and she was trotting easily across the inn yard as she kicked up the street mists she could hear the sounds of argument coming from the riddle skiller rushed past his wife and laid a hand on the tap of the nearest barrel he paused and then wrenched it open the smell of peach brandy filled the room sharp as knives he shut off the flow and relaxed afraid it would turn into something nasty asked his wife he nodded if you hadnt been so clumsy she began i tell you it bit me you could have been a wizard and we wouldnt have to bother with all this have you got no ambition skiller shook his head i reckon it takes more than a staff to make a wizard he said anyway i heard where it said wizards arent allowed to get married theyre not even allowed to he hesitated to what allowed to what skiller writhed well you know thing im sure i dont know what youre talking about said mrs skiller briskly no i suppose not he followed her reluctantly out of the darkened barroom it seemed to him that perhaps wizards didnt have such a bad life at that he was proved right when the following morning revealed that the ten barrels of peach brandy had indeed turned into something nasty esk wandered aimlessly through the grey streets until she reached ohulans tiny river docks broad flatbottomed barges bobbed gently against the wharves and one or two of them curled wisps of smoke from friendly stovepipes esk clambered easily on to the nearest and used the staff to lever up the oilcloth that covered most of it a warm smell a mixture of lanolin and midden drifted up the barge was laden with wool its silly to go to sleep on an unknown barge not knowing what strange cliffs may be drifting past when you awake not knowing that bargees traditionally get an early start not knowing what new horizons might greet one on the morrow you know that esk didnt esk awoke to the sound of someone whistling she lay quite still reeling the evenings events across her mind until she remembered why she was here and then rolled over very carefully and raised the oilcloth a fraction here she was then but here had moved this is what they call sailing then she said watching the far bank glide past it doesnt seem very special it didnt occur to her to start worrying for the first eight years of her life the world had been a particularly boring place and now that it was becoming interesting esk wasnt about to act ungrateful the distant whistler was joined by a barking dog esk lay back in the wool and reached out until she found the animals mind and borrowed it gently from its inefficient and disorganised brain she learned that there were at least four people on this barge and many more on the others that were strung out in line with it on the river some of them seemed to be children she let the animal go and looked out at the scenery again for a long time the barge was passing between high orange cliffs now banded with so many colours of rock it looked as though some hungry god had made the alltime record club sandwich and tried to avoid the next thought but it persisted arriving in her mind like the unexpected limbo dancer under the lavatory door of life sooner or later she would have to go out it wasnt her stomach that was pressing the point but her bladder brooked no delay perhaps if she the oilcloth over her head was pulled aside swiftly and a big bearded head beamed down at her well well it said what have we here then a stowaway yesno esk gave it a stare yes she said there seemed no sense in denying it could you help me out please arent you afraid i shall throw you to the the pike said the head it noticed her perplexed look big freshwater fish it added helpfully fast lot of teeth pike the thought hadnt occurred to her at all no she said truthfully why will you no not really theres no need to be frightened im not oh a brown arm appeared attached to the head by the normal arrangements and helped her out of her nest in the fleeces esk stood on the deck of the barge and looked around the sky was bluer than a biscuit barrel fitting neatly over a broad valley through which the river ran as sluggishly as a planning inquiry behind her the ramtops still acted as a hitching rail for clouds but they no longer dominated as they had done for as long as esk had known them distance had eroded them wheres this she said sniffing the new smells of swamp and sedge the upper valley of the river ankh said her captor what do you think of it esk looked up and down the river it was already much wider than it had been at ohulan i dont know theres certainly a lot of it is this your ship boat he corrected he was taller than her father although not quite so old and dressed like a gypsy most of his teeth had turned gold but esk decided it wasnt the time to ask why he had the kind of real deep tan that rich people spend ages trying to achieve with expensive holidays and bits of tinfoil when really all you need to do to obtain one is work your arse off in the open air every day his brow crinkled yes its mine he said determined to regain the initiative and what are you doing on it i would like to know running away from home yesno if you were a boy id say are you going to seek your fortune cant girls seek their fortune i think theyre supposed to seek a boy with a fortune said the man and gave a zoocarat grin he extended a brown hand heavy with rings come and have some breakfast id actually like to use your privy she said his mouth dropped open this is a barge yesno yes that means theres only the river he patted her hand dont worry he added its quite used to it granny stood on the wharf her boot taptaptapping on the wood the little man who was the nearest thing ohulan had to a dockmaster was being treated to the full force of one of her stares and was visibly wilting her expression wasnt perhaps as vicious as thumbscrews but it did seem to suggest that thumbscrews were a real possibility they left before dawn you say she said yesss he said er i didnt know they werent supposed to did you see a little girl on board taptap went her boot um no im sorry he brightened they were zoons he said if the child was with them she wont come to harm you can always trust a zoon they say very keen on family life granny turned to hilta who was fluttering like a bewildered butterfly and raised her eyebrows oh yes hilta trilled the zoons have a very good name mmph said granny she turned on her heel and stumped back towards the centre of the town the dockmaster sagged as though a coathanger had just been removed from his shirt hiltas lodgings were over a herbalists and behind a tannery and offered splendid views of the rooftops of ohulan she liked it because it offered privacy always appreciated by as she put it my more discerning clients who prefer to make their very special purchases in an atmosphere of calm where discretion is forever the watchword granny weatherwax looked around the sitting room with barelyconcealed scorn there were altogether too many tassels bead curtains astrological charts and black cats in the place granny couldnt abide cats she sniffed is that the tannery she said accusingly incense said hilta she rallied bravely in the face of grannys scorn the customers appreciate it she said it puts them in the right frame of mind you know how it is i would have thought one could carry out a perfectly respectable business hilta without resorting to parlour tricks said granny sitting down and beginning the long and tricky business of removing her hatpins its different in towns said hilta one has to move with the times im sure i dont know why is the kettle on granny reached across the table and took the velvet cover off hiltas crystal ball a sphere of quartz as big as her head never could get the hang of this damn silicon stuff she said a bowl of water with a drop of ink in it was good enough when i was a girl lets see now she peered into the dancing heart of the ball trying to use it to focus her mind on the whereabouts of esk a crystal was a tricky thing to use at the best of times and usually staring into it meant that the one thing the future could be guaranteed to hold was a severe migraine granny distrusted them considering them to smack of wizardry for two pins it always seemed to her the wretched thing would suck your mind out like a whelk from a shell damn things all sparkly she said huffing on it and wiping it with her sleeve hilta peered over her shoulder thats not sparkle that means something she said slowly what im not sure can i try its used to me hilta pushed a cat off the other chair and leaned forward to peer into the glass depths mnph feel free said granny but you wont find wait somethings coming through looks all sparkly from here granny insisted little silver lights all floating around like in them little snowstorminabottle toys quite pretty really yes but look beyond the flakes granny looked this was what she saw the viewpoint was very high up and a wide swathe of country lay below her blue with distance through which a broad river wriggled like a drunken snake there were silver lights floating in the foreground but they were in a manner of speaking just a few flakes in the great storm of lights that turned in a great lazy spiral like a geriatric tornado with a bad attack of snow and funnelled down down to the hazy landscape by screwing up her eyes granny could just make out some dots on the river occasionally some sort of lighting would sparkle briefly inside the gently turning funnel of motes granny blinked and looked up the room seemed very dark odd sort of weather she said because she couldnt really think of anything better even with her eyes shut the glittering motes still danced across her vision i dont think its weather said hilta i dont actually think people can see it but the crystal shows it i think its magic condensing out of the air into the staff yes thats what a wizards staff does it sort of distils magic granny risked another glance at the crystal into esk she said carefully yes there looks like quite a lot of it yes not for the first time granny wished she knew more about how wizards worked their magic she had a vision of esk filling up with magic until every tissue and pore was bloated with the stuff then it would start leaking slowly at first arcing to ground in little bursts but then building up to a great discharge of occult potentiality it could do all kinds of damage drat she said i never did like that staff at least shes heading towards the university place said hilta theyll know what to do thats as may be how far down river do you reckon they are twenty miles or so those barges only go at walking pace the zoons arent in any hurry right granny stood up her jaw set defiantly she reached for her hat and picked up her sack of possessions reckon i can walk faster than a barge she said the rivers all bendy but i can go in straight lines youre going to walk after her said hilta aghast but theres forests and wild animals good i could do with getting back to civilisation she needs me that staff is taking over i said it would but did anyone listen did they said hilta still trying to work out what granny meant by getting back to civilisation no said granny coldly his name was amschat bhal zoon he lived on the raft with his three wives and three children he was a liar what always annoyed the enemies of the zoon tribe was not simply their honesty which was infuriatingly absolute but their total directness of approach the zoons had never heard about a euphemism and wouldnt understand what to do with it if they had one except that they would certainly have called it a nice way of saying something nasty their rigid adherence to the truth was apparently not enjoined on them by a god as is usually the case but appeared to have a genetic base the average zoon could no more tell a lie than breathe underwater and in fact the very concept was enough to upset them considerably telling a lie meant no less than totally altering the universe this was something of a drawback to a trading race and so over the millennia the elders of the zoon studied this strange power that everyone else had in such abundance and decided that they should possess it too young men who showed faint signs of having such a talent were encouraged on special ceremonial occasions to bend the truth ever further on a competitive basis the first recorded zoon protolie was actually my grandfather is quite tall but eventually they got the hang of it and the office of tribal liar was instituted it must be understood that while the majority of zoon cannot lie they have great respect for any zoon who can say that the world is other than it is and the liar holds a position of considerable eminence he represents his tribe in all his dealings with the outside world which the average zoon long ago gave up trying to understand zoon tribes are very proud of their liars other races get very annoyed about all this they feel that the zoon ought to have adopted more suitable titles like diplomat or public relations officer they feel they are poking fun at the whole thing is all that true said esk suspiciously looking around the barges crowded cabin no said amschat firmly his junior wife who was cooking porridge over a tiny ornate stove giggled his three children watched esk solemnly over the edge of the table dont you ever tell the truth do you amschat grinned his goldmine grin but his eyes were not smiling why do i find you on my fleeces amschat is no kidnapper there will be people at home who will worry yesno i expect granny will come looking for me said esk but i dont think she will worry much just be angry i expect anyway im going to ankhmorpork you can put me off the ship boat if you like i dont mind about the pike i cant do that said amschat was that a lie no there is wild country around us robbers and things esk nodded brightly thats settled then she said i dont mind sleeping in the fleeces and i can pay my way i can do she hesitated her unfinished sentence hung like a little curl of crystal in the air while discretion made a successful bid for control of her tongue helpful things she finished lamely she was aware that amschat was looking slightly sideways at his senior wife who was sewing by the stove by zoon tradition she wore nothing but black granny would have thoroughly approved what sort of helpful things he asked washing and sweeping yesno if you like said esk or distillation using the bifold or triple alembic the making of varnishes glazes creams zuumchats and punes the rendering of waxes the manufacture of candles the proper selection of seeds roots and cuttings and most preparations from the eighty marvellous herbs i can spin card rett hallow and weave on the hand frame harp and noble looms and i can knit if people start the wool on for me i can read soil and rock do carpentry up to the threeway mortise and tenon predict weather by means of beastsign and skyreck make increase in bees brew five types of mead make dyes and mordants and pigments including a fast blue i can do most types of whitesmithing mend boots cure and fashion most leathers and if you have any goats i can look after them i like goats amschat looked at her thoughtfully she felt she was expected to continue granny never likes to see people sitting around doing nothing she offered she always says a girl who is good with her hands will never want for a living she added by way of further explanation or a husband i expect nodded amschat weakly actually granny had a lot to say about that i bet she did said amschat he looked at the senior wife who nodded almost imperceptibly very well he said if you can make yourself useful you can stay and can you play a musical instrument esk returned his steady gaze not batting an eyelid probably and so esk with the minimum of difficulty and only a little regret left the ramtops and their weather and joined the zoons on their great trading journey down the ankh there were at least thirty barges with at least one sprawling zoon family on each and no two vessels appeared to be carrying the same cargo most of them were strung together and the zoons simply hauled on the cable and stepped on to the next deck if they fancied a bit of socialising esk set up home in the fleeces it was warm smelled slightly of grannys cottage and much more important meant that she was undisturbed she was getting a bit worried about magic it was definitely getting out of control she wasnt doing magic it was just happening around her and she sensed that people probably wouldnt be too happy if they knew it meant that if she washed up she had to clatter and splash at length to conceal the fact that the dishes were cleaning themselves if she did some darning she had to do it on some private part of the deck to conceal the fact that the edges of the hole ravelled themselves together as if as if by magic then she woke up on the second day of her voyage to find that several of the fleeces around the spot where she had hidden the staff had combed carded and spun themselves into neat skeins during the night she put all thoughts of lighting fires out of her head there were compensations though every sluggish turn of the great brown river brought new scenes there were dark stretches hemmed in with deep forest through which the barges traveled in the dead centre of the river with the men armed and the women below except for esk who sat listening with interest to the snortings and sneezings that followed them through the bushes on the banks there were stretches of farmland there were several towns much larger than ohulan there were even some mountains although they were old and flat and not young and frisky like her mountains not that she was homesick exactly but sometimes she felt like a boat herself drifting on the edge of an infinite rope but always attached to an anchor the barges stopped at some of the towns by tradition only the men went ashore and only amschat wearing his ceremonial lying hat spoke to nonzoons esk usually went with him he tried hinting that she should obey the unwritten rules of zoon life and stay afloat but a hint was to esk what a mosquito bite was to the average rhino because she was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will half the time quietly rewrite them so that they dont apply to you anyway it seemed to amschat that when esk was with him he always got a very good price there was something about a small child squinting determinedly at them from behind his legs that made even markethardened merchants hastily conclude their business in fact it began to worry him when a market broker in the walled town of zemphis offered him a bag of ultramarines in exchange for a hundred fleeces a voice from the level of his pockets said theyre not ultramarines listen to the child said the broker grinning amschat solemnly held one of the stones to his eye i am listening he said and they do indeed look like ultramarines they have the glit and shimmy esk shook her head theyre just spircles she said she said it without thinking and regretted it immediately as both men turned to stare at her amschat turned the stone over in his palm putting the chameleon spircle stones into a box with some real gems so that they appeared to change their hue was a traditional trick but these had the true inner blue fire he looked up sharply at the broker amschat had been finely trained in the art of the lie he recognised the subtle signs now that he came to think about it there seems to be a doubt he said but tis easily resolved we need only take them to the assayer in pine street because the world knows that spircles will dissolve in hypactic fluid yesno the broker hesitated amschat had changed position slightly and the set of his muscles suggested that any sudden movement on the brokers part would see him flat in the dust and that damn child was squinting at him as though she could see through to the back of his mind his nerve broke i regret this unfortunate dispute he said i had accepted the stones as ultramarines in good faith but rather than cause disharmony between us i will ask you to accept them as as a gift and for the fleeces may i offer this roseatte of the first sorting he took a small red stone from a tiny velvet pouch amschat hardly looked at it but without taking his eyes off the man passed it down to esk she nodded when the merchant had hurried off amschat took esks hand and halfdragged her to the assayers stall which was little more than a niche in the wall the old man took the smallest of the blue stones listened to amschats hurried explanation poured out a saucerful of hypactic fluid and dropped the stone in it frothed into nothingness very interesting he said he took another stone in a tweezer and examined it under a glass they are indeed spircles but remarkably fine specimens in their own right he concluded they are by no means worthless and i for example would be prepared to offer you is there something wrong with the little girls eyes amschat nudged esk who stopped trying out another look i would offer you shall we say two zats of silver shall we say five said amschat pleasantly and i would like to keep one of the stones said esk the old man threw up his hands but they are mere curios he said of value only to a collector a collector may yet sell them to an unsuspecting purchaser as finest roseattes or ultramarines said amschat especially if he was the only assayer in town the assayer grumbled a bit at this but at last they settled on three zats and one of the spircles on a thin silver chain for esk when they were out of earshot amschat handed her the tiny silver coins and said these are yours you have earned them but he hunkered down so that his eyes were on a level with hers you must tell me how you knew the stones were false he looked worried but esk sensed that he wouldnt really like the truth magic made people uncomfortable he wouldnt like it if she said simply spircles are spircles and ultramarines are ultramarines and though you may think they look the same that is because most people dont use their eyes in the right way nothing can entirely disguise its true nature instead she said the dwarves mine spircles near the village where i was born and you soon learn to see how they bend light in a funny way amschat looked into her eyes for some time then he shrugged okay he said fine well i have some further business here why dont you buy yourself some new clothes or something id warn you against unscrupulous traders but somehow i dont know i dont think you will have any trouble esk nodded amschat strode off through the market place at the first corner he turned looked at her thoughtfully and then disappeared among the crowds well thats the end of sailing esk told herself hes not quite sure but hes going to be watching me now and before i know whats happening the staff will be taken away and therell be all sorts of trouble why does everyone get so upset about magic she gave a philosophical sigh and set about exploring the possibilities of the town there was the question of the staff though esk had rammed it deep among the fleeces which were not going to be unloaded yet if she went back for it people would start asking questions and she didnt know the answers she found a convenient alleyway and scuttled down it until a deep doorway gave her the privacy she required if going back was out of the question then only one thing remained she held out a hand and closed her eyes she knew exactly what she wanted to doit lay in front of her eyes the staff mustnt come flying through the air wrecking the barge and drawing attention to itself all she wanted she told herself was for there to be a slight change in the way the world was organised it shouldnt be a world where the staff was in the fleeces it should be a world where it was in her hand a tiny change an infinitesimal alteration to the way things were if esk had been properly trained in wizardry she would have known that this was impossible all wizards knew how to move things about starting with protons and working upwards but the important thing about moving something from a to z according to basic physics was that at some point it should pass through the rest of the alphabet the only way one could cause something to vanish at a and appear at z would be to shuffle the whole of reality sideways the problems this would cause didnt bear thinking about esk of course had not been trained and it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what youre attempting cant be done a person ignorant of the possibility of failure can be a halfbrick in the path of the bicycle of history as esk tried to work out how to move the staff the ripples spread out in the magical ether changing the discworld in thousands of tiny ways most went entirely unnoticed perhaps a few grains of sand lay on their beaches in a slightly different position or the occasional leaf hung on its tree in a marginally different way but then the wavefront of probability struck the edge of reality and rebounded like the slosh off the side of the pond which meeting the laggard ripples coming the other way caused small but important whirlpools in the very fabric of existence you can have whirlpools in the fabric of existence because it is a very strange fabric esk was completely ignorant of all this of course but was quite satisfied when the staff dropped out of thin air into her hand it felt warm she looked at it for some time she felt that she ought to do something about it it was too big too distinctive too inconvenient it attracted attention if im taking you to ankhmorpork she said thoughtfully youve got to go in disguise a few late flickers of magic played around the staff and then it went dark eventually esk solved the immediate problem by finding a stall in the main zemphis marketplace that sold broomsticks buying the largest carrying it back to her doorway removing the handle and ramming the staff deep into the birch twigs it didnt seem right to treat a noble object in this way and she silently apologised to it it made a difference anyway no one looked twice at a small girl carrying a broom she bought a spice pasty to eat while exploring the town was smaller than ohulan and very different because it lay on the junction of three trade routes quite apart from the river itself it was built around one enormous square which was a cross between a permanent exotic traffic jam and a tent village camels kicked mules mules kicked horses horses kicked camels and they all kicked humans there was a riot of colours a din of noise a nasal orchestration of smells and the steady heady sound of hundreds of people working hard at making money one reason for the bustle was that over large parts of the continent other people preferred to make money without working at all and since the disc had yet to develop a music recording industry they were forced to fall back on older more traditional forms of banditry strangely enough these often involved considerable effort rolling heavy rocks to the top of cliffs for a decent ambush cutting down trees to block the road and digging a pit lined with spikes while still keeping a wicked edge on a dagger probably involved a much greater expenditure of thought and muscle than more sociallyacceptable professions but nevertheless there were still people misguided enough to endure all this plus long nights in uncomfortable surroundings merely to get their hands on perfectly ordinary large boxes of jewels so a town like zemphis was the place where caravans split mingled and came together again as dozens of merchants and travellers banded together for protection against the socially disadvantaged on the trails ahead esk wandering unregarded amidst the bustle learned all this by the simple method of finding someone who looked important and tugging on the hem of his coat this particular man was counting bales of tobacco and would have succeeded but for the interruption what i said what happening here the man meant to say push off and bother someone else he meant to give her a light cuff about the head so he was astonished to find himself bending down and talking seriously to a small grubbyfaced child holding a large broomstick he explained about the caravans the child nodded people all get together to travel precisely where to all sorts of places sto lat pseudopolis ankhmorpork of course but the river goes there said esk reasonably barges the zoons ah yes said the merchant but they charge high prices and they cant carry everything and anyway no one trusts them much but theyre very honest huh yes he said but you know what they say never trust an honest man he smiled knowingly who says that they do you know people he said a certain uneasiness entering his voice oh said esk she thought about it they must be very silly she said primly thank you anyway he watched her wander off and got back to his counting a moment later there was another tug at his coat fiftysevenfiftysevenfiftysevenwell he said trying not to lose his place sorry to bother you again said esk but those bale things what about them fiftysevenfiftysevenfiftyseven well are they supposed to have little white worm things in them fiftysev what the merchant lowered his slate and stared at esk what little worms wriggly ones white added esk helpfully all sort of burrowing about in the middle of the bales you mean tobacco threadworm he looked wildeyed at the stack of bales being unloaded by now he came to think about it a vendor with the nervous look of a midnight sprite who wants to get away before you find out what fairy gold turns into in the morning but he told me these had been well stored and how do you know anyway the child had disappeared among the crowds the merchant looked hard at the spot where she had been he looked hard at the vendor who was grinning nervously he looked hard at the sky then took his sampling knife out of his pocket stared at it for a moment appeared to reach a decision and sidled towards the nearest bale esk meanwhile had by random eavesdropping found the caravan being assembled for ankhmorpork the trail boss was sitting at a table made up of a plank across two barrels he was busy he was talking to a wizard seasoned travellers know that a party setting out to cross possibly hostile country should have a fair number of swords in it but should definitely have a wizard in case there is any need for magic arts and even if these do not become necessary for lighting fires a wizard of the third rank or above does not expect to pay for the privilege of joining the party rather he expects to be paid delicate negotiations were even now coming to a conclusion fair enough master treatle but what of the young man said the trail boss one adab gander an impressive figure in a trollhide jerkin rakishly floppy hat and a leather kilt hes no wizard i can see he is in training said treatle a tall skinny wizard whose robes declared him to be a mage of the ancient and truly original brothers of the silver star one of the eight orders of wizardry then no wizard he said gander i know the rules and youre not a wizard unless youve got a staff and he hasnt even now he travels to the unseen university for that small detail said treatle loftily wizards parted with money slightly less readily than tigers parted with their teeth gander looked at the lad in question he had met a good many wizards in his time and considered himself a good judge and he had to admit that this boy looked like good wizard material in other words he was thin gangling pale from reading disturbing books in unhealthy rooms and had watery eyes like two lightlypoached eggs it crossed ganders mind that one must speculate in order to accumulate all he needs to get right to the top he thought is a bit of a handicap wizards are martyrs to things like asthma and flat feet it somehow seems to give them their drive whats your name lad he said as kindly as possible sssssssssssssss said the boy his adams apple bobbed like a captive balloon he turned to his companion full of mute appeal simon said trestle imon agreed simon thankfully can you cast fireballs or whirling spells such as might be hurled against an enemy simon looked sideways at trestle nnnnnnnnnn he ventured my young friend follows higher magic than the mere hurling of sorceries said the wizard o said simon gander nodded well he said maybe you will indeed be a wizard lad maybe when you have your fine staff youll consent to travel with me one time yes i will make an investment in you yes just nod said gander who was not naturally a cruel man simon nodded gratefully treatle and gander exchanged nods and then the wizard strode off with his apprentice trailing behind under a weight of baggage gander looked down at the list in front of him and carefully crossed out wizard a small shadow fell across the page he glanced up and gave an involuntary start well he said coldly i want to go to ankhmorpork said esk please ive got some money go home to your mother child no really i want to seek my fortune gander sighed why are you holding that broomstick he said esk looked at it as though she had never seen it before everythings got to be somewhere she said just go home my girl said gander im not taking any runaways to ankhmorpork strange things can happen to little girls in big cities esk brightened what sort of strange things look i said go home right now he picked up his chalk and went on ticking off items on his slate trying to ignore the steady gaze that seemed to be boring through the top of his head i can be helpful said esk quietly gander threw down the chalk and scratched his chin irritably how old are you he said nine well miss nineyearsold ive got two hundred animals and a hundred people that want to go to ankh and half of them hate the other half and ive not got enough people who can fight and they say the roads are pretty bad and the bandits are getting really cheeky up in the paps and the trolls are demanding a bigger bridge toll this year and theres weevils in the supplies and i keep getting these headaches and where in all this do i need you oh said esk she looked around the crowded square which one of these roads goes to ankh then the one over there with the gate thank you she said gravely goodbye i hope you dont have any more trouble and your head gets better right said gander uncertainly he drummed his fingers on the tabletop as he watched esk walk away in the direction of the ankh road a long winding road a road haunted by thieves and gnolls a road that wheezed through high mountain passes and crawled panting over deserts oh bugger he said under his breath hey you granny weatherwax was in trouble first of all she decided she should never have allowed hilta to talk her into borrowing her broomstick it was elderly erratic would fly only at night and even then couldnt manage a speed much above a trot its lifting spells had worn so thin that it wouldnt even begin to operate until it was already moving at a fair lick it was in fact the only broomstick ever to need bumpstarting and it was while granny weatherwax sweating and cursing was running along a forest path holding the damn thing at shoulder height for the tenth time that she had found the bear trap the second problem was that a bear had found it first in fact this hadnt been too much of a problem because granny already in a bad temper hit it right between the eyes with the broomstick and it was now sitting as far away from her as it was possible to get in a pit and trying to think happy thoughts it was not a very comfortable night and the morning wasnt much better for the party of hunters who around dawn peered over the edge of the pit about time too said granny get me out the startled heads withdrew and granny could hear a hasty whispered conversation they had seen the hat and broomstick finally a bearded head reappeared rather reluctantly as if the body it was attached to was being pushed forward um it began look mother im not a mother snapped granny im certainly not your mother if you ever had mothers which i doubt if i was your mother id have run away before you were born its only a figure of speech said the head reproachfully its a damned insult is what it is there was another whispered conversation if i dont get out said granny in ringing tones there will be trouble do you see my hat eh do you see it the head reappeared thats the whole point isnt it it said i mean what will there be if we let you out it seems less risky all round if we just sort of fill the pit in nothing personal you understand granny realized what it was that was bothering her about the head are you kneeling down she said accusingly youre not are you youre dwarves whisper whisper well what about it asked the head defiantly nothing wrong with that is there what have you got against dwarves do you know how to repair broomsticks magic broomsticks yes whisper whisper what if we do well we could come to some arrangement the dwarf halls rang to the sound of hammers although mainly for effect dwarves found it hard to think without the sound of hammers which they found soothing so welloff dwarves in the clerical professions paid goblins to hit small ceremonial anvils just to maintain the correct dwarvish image the broomstick lay between two trestles granny weatherwax sat on a rock outcrop while a dwarf half her height wearing an apron that was a mass of pockets walked around the broom and occasionally poked it eventually he kicked the bristles and gave a long intake of breath a sort of reverse whistle which is the secret sign of craftsmen across the universe and means that something expensive is about to happen weellll he said i could get the apprentices in to look at this i could its an education in itself and you say it actually managed to get airborne it flew like a bird said granny the dwarf lit a pipe i should very much like to see that bird he said reflectively i should imagine its quite something to watch a bird like that yes but can you repair it said granny im in a hurry the dwarf sat down slowly and deliberately as for repair he said well i dont know about repair rebuild maybe of course its hard to get the bristles these days even if you can find people to do the proper binding and the spells need i dont want it rebuilt i just want it to work properly said granny its an early model you see the dwarf plugged on very tricky those early models you cant get the wood he was picked up bodily until his eyes were level with grannys dwarves being magical in themselves as it were are quite resistant to magic but her expression looked as though she was trying to weld his eyeballs to the back of his skull just repair it she hissed please what make a bodge job said the dwarf his pipe clattering to the floor yes patch it up you mean betray my training by doing half a job yes said granny her pupils were two little black holes oh said the dwarf right then gander the trail boss was a worried man they were three mornings out from zemphis making good time and were climbing now towards the rocky pass through the mountains known as the paps of scilla there were eight of them gander often wondered who scilla had been and whether he would have liked her a party of gnolls had crept up on them during the night the nasty creatures a variety of stone goblin had slit the throat of a guard and must have been poised to slaughter the entire party only only no one knew quite what had happened next the screams had woken them up and by the time people had puffed up the fires and treatle the wizard had cast a blue radiance over the campsite the surviving gnolls were distant spidery shadows running as if all the legions of hell were after them judging by what had happened to their colleagues they were probably right bits of gnolls hung from the nearby rocks giving them a sort of jolly festive air gander wasnt particularly sorry about that gnolls liked to capture travellers and practise hospitality of the redhotknifeandbludgeon kind but he was nervous of being in the same area as something that went through a dozen wiry and wickedly armed gnolls like a spoon through a lightlyboiled egg but left no tracks in fact the ground was swept clean it had been a very long night and the morning didnt seem to be an improvement the only person more than halfawake was esk who had slept through the whole thing under one of the wagons and had complained only of odd dreams still it was a relief to get away from that macabre sight gander considered that gnolls didnt look any better inside than out he hated their guts esk sat on treatles wagon talking to simon who was steering inexpertly while the wizard caught up with some sleep behind them simon did everything inexpertly he was really good at it he was one of those tall lads apparently made out of knees thumbs and elbows watching him walk was a strain you kept waiting for the strings to snap and when he talked the spasm of agony on his face if he spotted an s or w looming ahead in the sentence made people instinctively say them for him it was worth it for the grateful look which spread across his acned face like sunrise on the moon at the moment his eyes were streaming with hayfever did you want to be a wizard when you were a little boy simon shook his head i just www wanted tto find out how things www worked yes then someone in my village told the university and mmaster ttreatle was sent to bring me i shall be a www wizard one day master treatle says i have an exceptional grasp of ththeory simons damp eyes misted over and an expression almost of bliss drifted across his ravaged face he ttells me theyve got thousands of bbooks in the library at unseen university he said in the voice of a man in love more bbooks than anyone could read in a lifetime im not sure i like books said esk conversationally how can paper know things my granny says books are only good if the paper is thin no thats not right said simon urgently books are full of www he gulped air and gave her a pleading look words said esk after a moments thought yes and they can change ththings ththats wuwuw that wuwuwwhhawhha what i must ffind i know its ththere somewhere in all the old books they ssss say theres no new spells but i know that its there somewhere hiding the wwwwwuwu words yes that no wiwiwi wizard said esk her face a frown of concentration yes has ever found his eyes closed and he smiled a beatific smile and added the words that will change the world what eh said simon opening his eyes in time to stop the oxen wandering off the track you said all those wubbleyous idid i heard you try again simon took a deep breath the worworwor the wuwuw he said the wowowoo he continued its no good its gone he said it happens sometimes if i dont think about it master treatle says im allergic to something allergic to doubleyous no sisssisi silly said esk generously theres sososo something in the air ppollen maybe or ggrass dust master treatle has tried to find the cause of it but no magic seems to hhelp it they were passing through a narrow pass of orange rock simon looked at it disconsolately my granny taught me some hayfever cures esk said we could try those simon shook his head it looked touch and go whether it would fall off tried everything he said fine wwiwwimagician id make eh cant even sssutter the wowoname i could see where that would be a problem said esk she watched the scenery for a while marshalling a train of thought is it er possible for a woman to be you know a wizard she said eventually simon stared at her she gave him a defiant look his throat strained he was trying to find a sentence that didnt start with a w in the end he was forced to make concessions a curious idea he said he thought some more and started to laugh until esks expression warned him rather funny really he added but the laughter in his face faded and was replaced by a puzzled look never really tthought about it before well can they you could have shaved with esks voice of course they cant it is selfevident child simon return to your studies treatle pushed aside the curtain that led into the back of the wagon and climbed out on to the seat board the look of mild panic took up its familiar place on simons face he gave esk a pleading glance as treatle took the reins from his hands but she ignored him why not whats so selfevident treatle turned and looked down at her he hadnt really paid much attention before she was simply just another figure around the campfires he was the vicechancellor of unseen university and quite used to seeing vague scurrying figures getting on with essential but unimportant jobs like serving his meals and dusting his rooms he was stupid yes in the particular way that very clever people can be stupid and maybe he had all the tact of an avalanche and was as selfcentred as a tornado but it would never have occurred to him that children were important enough to be unkind to from long white hair to curly boots treatle was a wizards wizard he had the appropriate long bushy eyebrows spangled robe and patriarchal beard that was only slightly spoiled by the yellow nicotine stains wizards are celibate but nevertheless enjoy a good cigar it will all become clear to you when you grow up he said its an amusing idea of course a nice play on words a female wizard you might as well invent a male witch warlocks said esk pardon me my granny says men cant be witches said esk she says if men tried to be witches theyd be wizards she sounds a very wise woman said treatle she says women should stick to what theyre good at esk went on very sensible of her she says if women were as good as men theyd be a lot better treatle laughed shes a witch said esk and added in her mind there what do you think of that mr socalled cleverwizard my dear good young lady am i supposed to be shocked i happen to have a great respect for witches esk frowned he wasnt supposed to say that you have yes indeed i happen to believe that witchcraft is a fine career for a woman a very noble calling you do i mean it is oh yes very useful in rural districts for for people who are having babies and so forth however witches are not wizards witchcraft is natures way of allowing women access to the magical fluxes but you must remember it is not high magic i see not high magic said esk grimly oh no witchcraft is very suitable for helping people through life of course but i expect women arent really sensible enough to be wizards said esk i expect thats it really i have nothing but the highest respect for women said treatle who hadnt noticed the fresh edge to esks tone they are without parallel when when for having babies and so forth there is that yes the wizard conceded generously but they can be a little unsettling at times a little too excitable high magic requires great clarity of thought you see and womens talents do not lie in that direction their brains tend to overheat i am sorry to say there is only one door into wizardry and that is the main gate at unseen university and no woman has ever passed through it tell me said esk what good is high magic exactly treatle smiled at her high magic my child he said can give us everything we want oh so put all this wizard nonsense out of your head all right treatle gave her a benevolent smile what is your name child eskarina and why do you go to ankh my dear i thought i might seek my fortune muttered esk but i think perhaps girls dont have fortunes to seek are you sure wizards give people what they want of course that is what high magic is for i see the whole caravan was travelling only a little faster than walking pace esk jumped down pulled the staff from its temporary hiding place among the bags and pails on the side of the wagon and ran back along the line of carts and animals through her tears she caught a glimpse of simon peering from the back of the wagon an open book in his hands he gave her a puzzled smile and started to say something but she ran on and veered off the track scrubby whinbushes scratched her legs as she scrambled up a clay bank and then she was running free across a barren plateau hemmed in by the orange cliffs she didnt stop until she was good and lost but the anger still burned brightly she had been angry before but never like this normally anger was like the red flame you got when the forge was first lit all glow and sparks but this anger was differentit had the bellows behind it and had narrowed to the tiny bluewhite flame that cuts iron it made her body tingle she had to do something about it or burst why was it that when she heard granny ramble on about witchcraft she longed for the cutting magic of wizardry but whenever she heard treatle speak in his highpitched voice she would fight to the death for witchcraft shed be both or none at all and the more they intended to stop her the more she wanted it shed be a witch and a wizard too and she would show them esk sat down under a lowspreading juniper bush at the foot of a steep sheer cliff her mind seething with plans and anger she could sense doors being slammed before she had barely begun to open them treatle was right they wouldnt let her inside the university having a staff wasnt enough to be a wizard there had to be training too and no one was going to train her the midday sun beat down off the cliff and the air around esk began to smell of bees and gin she lay back looking at the nearpurple dome of the sky through the leaves and eventually she fell asleep one sideeffect of using magic is that one tends to have realistic and disturbing dreams there is a reason for this but even thinking about it is enough to give a wizard nightmares the fact is that the minds of wizards can give thoughts a shape witches normally work with what actually exists in the world but a wizard can if hes good enough put flesh on his imagination this wouldnt cause any trouble if it wasnt for the fact that the little circle of candlelight loosely called the universe of time and space is adrift in something much more unpleasant and unpredictable strange things circle and grunt outside the flimsy stockades of normality there are weird hootings and howlings in the deep crevices at the edge of time there are things so horrible that even the dark is afraid of them most people dont know this and this is just as well because the world could not really operate if everyone stayed in bed with the blankets over their head which is what would happen if people knew what horrors lay a shadows width away the problem is people interested in magic and mysticism spend a lot of time loitering on the very edge of the light as it were which gets them noticed by the creatures from the dungeon dimensions who then try to use them in their indefatigable efforts to break into this particular reality most people can resist this but the relentless probing by the things is never stronger than when the subject is asleep belshamharoth chulagen the insider the hideous old dark gods of the necrotelicomnicon the book known to certain mad adepts by its true name of liber paginarum fulvarum are always ready to steal into a slumbering mind the nightmares are often colourful and always unpleasant esk had got used to them ever since that first dream after her first borrowing and familiarity had almost replaced terror when she found herself sitting on a glittering dusty plain under unexplained stars she knew it was time for another one drat she said all right come on then bring on the monsters i just hope it isnt the one with his winkle on his face but this time it seemed that the nightmare had changed esk looked around and saw rearing up behind her a tall black castle its turrets disappeared among the stars lights and fireworks and interesting music cascaded from its upper battlements the huge double doors stood invitingly open there seemed to be quite an amusing party going on in there she stood up brushed the silver sand off her dress and set off for the gates she had almost reached them when they slammed they didnt appear to move it was simply that in one instant they were lounging ajar and the next they were tight shut with a clang that shook the horizons esk reached out and touched them they were black and so cold that ice was beginning to form on them there was a movement behind her she turned around and saw the staff without its broomstick disguise standing upright in the sand little worms of light crept around its polished wood and crept around the carvings no one could ever quite identify she picked it up and smashed it against the doors there was a shower of octarine sparks but the black metal was unscathed esks eyes narrowed she held the staff at arms length and concentrated until a thin line of fire leapt from the wood and burst against the gate the ice flashed into steam but the darkness she was sure now that it wasnt metal absorbed the power without so much as glowing she doubled the energy letting the staff put all its stored magic into a beam that was now so bright that she had to shut her eyes and could still see it as a brilliant line in her mind then it winked out after a few seconds esk ran forward and touched the doors gingerly the coldness nearly froze her fingers off and from the battlements above she could hear the sound of sniggering laughter wouldnt have been so bad especially an impressive demonic laugh with lots of echo but this was just sniggering it went on for a long time it was one of the most unpleasant sounds esk had ever heard she woke up shivering it was long after midnight and the stars looked damp and chilly the air was full of the busy silence of the night which is created by hundreds of small furry things treading very carefully in the hope of finding dinner while avoiding being the main course a crescent moon was setting and a thin grey glow towards the rim of the world suggested that against all probability another day was on the cards someone had wrapped esk in a blanket i know youre awake said the voice of granny weatherwax you could make yourself useful and light a fire theres damn all wood in these parts esk sat up and clutched at the juniper bush she felt light enough to float away fire she muttered yes you know pointing the finger and whoosh said granny sourly she was sitting on a rock trying to find a position that didnt upset her arthritis i i dont think i can you tell me said granny cryptically the old witch leaned forward and put her hand on esks forehead it was like being caressed by a sock full of warm dice youre running a bit of a temperature she added too much hot sun and cold ground thats forn parts for you esk let herself slump forward until her head lay in grannys lap with its familiar smells of camphor mixed herbs and a trace of goat granny patted her in what she hoped was a soothing way after a while esk said in a low voice theyre not going to allow me into the university a wizard told me and i dreamed about it and it was one of those true dreams you know like you told me a matything metterfor said granny calmly one of them did you think it would be easy asked granny did you think youd walk into their gates waving your staff here i am i want to be a wizard thank you very much he told me theres no women allowed in the university hes wrong no i could tell he was telling the truth you know granny you can tell how foolish child all you could tell was that he thought he was telling the truth the world isnt always as people see it i dont understand said esk youll learn said granny now tell me this dream they wouldnt let you into their university right yes and they laughed and then you tried to burn down the doors esk turned her head in grannys lap and opened a suspicious eye how did you know granny smiled but as a lizard would smile i was miles away she said i was bending my mind towards you and suddenly you seemed to be everywhere you shone out like a beacon so you did as for the fire look around in the halflight of dawn the plateau was a mass of baked clay in front of esk the cliff was glassy and must have flowed like tar under the onslaught there were great gashes across it which had dripped molten rock and slag when esk listened she could hear the faint pink pink of cooling rock oh she said did i do that so it would appear said granny but i was asleep i was only dreaming its the magic said granny its trying to find a way out the witch magic and the wizard magic are i dont know sort of feeding off each other i think esk bit her lip what can i do she asked i dream of all sorts of things well for a start were going straight to the university decided granny they must be used to apprentices not being able to control magic and having hot dreams else the place would have burned down years ago she glanced towards the rim and then down at the broomstick beside her we will pass over the running up and down the tightening of the broomsticks bindings the muttered curses against dwarves the brief moments of hope as the magic flickered fitfully the horrible black feelings as it died the tightening of the bindings again the running again the sudden catching of the spell the scrambling aboard the yelling the takeoff esk clung to granny with one hand and held her staff in the other as they frankly pottered along a few hundred feet above the ground a few birds flew alongside them interested in this new flying tree bugger off screamed granny taking off her hat and flapping it were not going very fast granny said esk meekly were going quite fast enough for me esk looked around behind them the rim was a blaze of gold barred with cloud i think we ought to go lower granny she said urgently you said the broomstick wont fly in sunlight she glanced down at the landscape below them it looked sharp and inhospitable it also looked expectant i know what im doing miss snapped granny gripping the broomstick hard and trying to make herself as light as possible it has already been revealed that light on the discworld travels slowly the result of its passage through the discs vast and ancient magical field so dawn isnt the sudden affair that it is on other worlds the new day doesnt erupt it sort of sloshes gently across the sleeping landscape in the same way that the tide sneaks in across the beach melting the sandcastles of the night it tends to flow around mountains if the trees are close together it comes out of woods cut to ribbons and sliced with shadows an observer on some suitable high point lets say for the sake of argument a wisp of cirrostratus on the edge of space would remark on how lovingly the light spreads across the land how it leaps forward on the plains and slows down when it encounters high ground how beautifully it actually there are some kinds of observers who faced with all this beauty will whine that you cant have heavy light and certainly wouldnt be able to see it even if you could to which one can only reply so how come youre standing on a cloud so much for cynicism but down on the disc itself the broomstick barrelled forward on the cusp of dawn dropping ever backward in the shadow of night granny day burst upon them ahead of the broomstick the rocks seemed to flash into flame as the light washed over them granny felt the stick lurch and stared with horrified fascination at the little scudding shadow below them it was getting closer what will happen when we hit the ground that depends if i can find some soft rocks said granny in a preoccupied voice the broomsticks going to crash cant we do anything well i suppose we could get off granny said esk in the exasperated and remarkably adult voice children use to berate their wayward elders i dont think you quite understand i dont want to hit the ground its never done anything to me granny was trying to think of a suitable spell and regretting that headology didnt work on rocks and had she detected the diamond edge to esks tone perhaps she wouldnt have said tell the broomstick that then and they would indeed have crashed but she remembered in time to grab her hat and brace herself the broomstick gave a shudder tilted and the landscape blurred it was really quite a short trip but one that granny knew she would always remember generally around three oclock in the morning after eating rich food she would remember the rainbow colours that hummed in the rushing air the horrible heavy feeling the impression that something very big and heavy was sitting on the universe she would remember esks laughter she would remember despite her best efforts the way the ground sped below them whole mountain ranges flashing past with nasty zipping noises most of all she would remember catching up with the night it appeared ahead of her a ragged line of darkness running ahead of the remorseless morning she stared in horrified fascination as the line became a blot a stain a whole continent of blackness that raced towards them for an instant they were poised on the crest of the dawn as it broke in silent thunder on the land no surfer ever rode such a wave but the broomstick broke through the broil of light and shot smoothly through into the coolness beyond granny let herself breathe out darkness took some of the terror out of the flight it also meant that if esk lost interest the broomstick ought to be able to fly under its own rather rusty magic granny said and cleared her bonedry throat for a second try esk this is fun isnt it i wonder how i make it happen yes fun said granny weakly but can i fly the stick please i dont want us to go over the edge please is it true that theres a giant waterfall all around the edge of the world and you can look down and see stars said esk yes can we slow down now id like to see it no i mean no not now the broomstick slowed the rainbow bubble around it vanished with an audible pop without a jolt without so much as a shudder granny found herself flying at a respectable speed again granny had built a solid reputation on always knowing the answer to everything getting her to admit ignorance even to herself was an astonishing achievement but the worm of curiosity was chewing at the apple of her mind how she said at last did you do that there was a thoughtful silence behind her then esk said i dont know i just needed it and it was in my head like when you remember something youve forgotten yes but how i i dont know i just had a picture of how i wanted things to be and and i sort of went into the picture granny stared into the night she had never heard of magic like that but it sounded awfully powerful and probably lethal went into the picture of course all magic changed the world in some way wizards thought there was no other use for it they didnt truck with the idea of leaving the world as it was and changing the people but this sounded more literal it needed thinking about on the ground for the first time in her life granny wondered whether there might be something important in all these books people were setting such store by these days although she was opposed to books on strict moral grounds since she had heard that many of them were written by dead people and therefore it stood to reason reading them would be as bad as necromancy among the many things in the infinitely varied universe with which granny did not hold was talking to dead people who by all accounts had enough troubles of their own but not she was inclined to feel as many as her she looked down bemusedly at the dark ground and wondered vaguely why the stars were below her for a cardiac moment she wondered if they had indeed flown over the edge and then she realised that the thousands of little pinpoints below her were too yellow and flickered besides whoever heard of stars arranged in such a neat pattern its very pretty said esk is it a city granny scanned the ground wildly if it was a city then it was too big but now she had time to think about it it certainly smelled like a lot of people the air around them reeked of incense and grain and spices and beer but mainly of the sort of smell that was caused by a high water table thousands of people and a robust approach to drainage she mentally shook herself the day was hard on their heels she looked for an area where the torches were dim and widely spaced reasoning that this would mean a poor district and poor people did not object to witches and gently pointed the broom handle downwards she managed to get within five feet of the ground before dawn arrived for the second time the gates were indeed big and black and looked as if they were made out of solid darkness granny and esk stood among the crowds that thronged the square outside the university and stared up at them finally esk said i cant see how people get in magic i expect said granny sourly thats wizards for you anyone else would have bought a doorknocker she waved her broomstick in the direction of the tall doors youve got to say some hocuspocus word to get in i shouldnt wonder she added they had been in ankhmorpork for three days and granny was beginning to enjoy herself much to her surprise she had found them lodgings in the shades an ancient part of the city whose inhabitants were largely nocturnal and never enquired about one anothers business because curiosity not only killed the cat but threw it in the river with weights tied to its feet the lodgings were on the top floor next to the wellguarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because as granny had heard good fences make good neighbors the shades in brief were an abode of discredited gods and unlicensed thieves ladies of the night and peddlers in exotic goods alchemists of the mind and strolling mummers in short all the grease on civilizations axle and yet despite the fact that these people tend to appreciate the soft magics there was a remarkable shortage of witches within hours the news of grannys arrival had seeped through the quarter and a stream of people crept sidled or strutted towards her door seeking potions and charms and news of the future and various personal and specialised services that witches traditionally provide for those whose lives are a little clouded or full of stormy weather she was at first annoyed and then embarrassed and then flattered her clients had money which was useful but they also paid in respect and that was a rockhard currency in short granny was even wondering about the possibility of acquiring slightly larger premises with a bit of garden and sending for her goats the smell might be a problem but the goats would just have to put up with it they had visited the sights of ankhmorpork its crowded docks its many bridges its souks its casbahs its streets lined with nothing but temples granny had counted the temples with a thoughtful look in her eyes gods were always demanding that their followers acted other than according to their true natures and the human fallout this caused made plenty of work for witches the terrors of civilisation had so far failed to materialise although a cutpurse had tried to make off with grannys handbag to the amazement of passersby granny called him back and back he came fighting his feet which had totally ceased to obey him no one quite saw what happened to her eyes when she stared into his face or heard the words she whispered in his cowering ear but he gave her back all her money plus quite a lot of money belonging to other people and before she let him go had promised to have a shave stand up straight and be a better person for the rest of his life by nightfall grannys description was circulated to all the chapter houses of the guild of thieves cutpurses housebreakers and allied trades with strict instructions to avoid her at all costs thieves being largely creatures of the night themselves know trouble when it stares them in the face granny had also written two more letters to the university there had been no reply i liked the forest best said esk i dunno said granny this is a bit like the forest really anyway people certainly appreciate a witch here theyre very friendly esk conceded you know the house down the street where that fat lady lives with all those young ladies you said were her relatives a very respectable body which in fact represented the major law enforcement agency in the city the reason for this is as follows the guild was given an annual quota which represented a socially acceptable level of thefts muggings and assassinations and in return saw to it in very definite and final ways that unofficial crime was not only rapidly stamped out but knifed garrotted dismembered and left around the city in an assortment of paper bags as well this was held to be a cheap and enlightened arrangement except by those malcontents who were actually mugged or assassinated and refused to see it as their social duty and it enabled the citys thieves to plan a decent career structure entrance examinations and codes of conduct similar to those adopted by the citys other professions which the gap not being very wide in any case they rapidly came to resemble mrs palm said granny cautiously very respectable lady people come to visit them all night long i watched im surprised they get any sleep um said granny it must be a trial for the poor woman with all those daughters to feed too i think people could be more considerate well now said granny im not sure that she was rescued by the arrival at the gates of the university of a large brightly painted wagon its driver reined in the oxen a few feet from granny and said excuse me my good woman but would you be so kind as to move please granny stepped aside affronted by this display of downright politeness and particularly upset at being thought of as anyones good woman and the driver saw esk it was treatle he grinned like a worried snake i say its the young lady who thinks women should be wizards isnt it yes said esk ignoring a sharp kick on the ankle from granny what fun come to join us have you yes said esk and then because something about treatles manner seemed to demand it she added sir only we cant get in we said treatle and then glanced at granny oh yes of course this would be your aunt my granny only not really my granny just sort of everyones granny granny gave a stiff nod well we cannot have this said treatle in a voice as hearty as a plum pudding my word no our first lady wizard left on the doorstep that would be a disgrace may i accompany you granny grasped esk firmly by the shoulder if its all the same to you she began but esk twisted out of her grip and ran towards the cart you can really take me in she said her eyes shining of course i am sure the heads of the orders will be most gratified to meet you most astonished and astounded he said and gave a little laugh eskarina smith said granny and then stopped she looked at treatle i dont know what is in your mind mr wizard but i dont like it she said esk you know where we live be a fool if you must but you might at least be your own fool she turned on her heel and strode off across the square what a remarkable woman said treatle vaguely i see you still have your broomstick capital he let go of the reins for a moment and made a complicated sign in the air with both hands the big doors swung back revealing a wide courtyard surrounded by lawns behind them was a great rambling building or buildings it was hard to tell because it didnt look so much as if it had been designed as that a lot of buttresses arches towers bridges domes cupolas and so forth had huddled together for warmth is that it said esk it looks sort of melted yes thats it said trestle alma mater gaudy armours eagle tour and so on of course its a lot bigger inside than out like an iceberg or so im given to understand ive never seen the things unseen university only of course a lot of it is unseen just go in the back and fetch simon will you esk pushed aside the heavy curtains and peered into the back of the wagon simon was lying on a pile of rugs reading a very large book and making notes on scraps of paper he looked up and gave her a worried smile is that you he said yes said esk with conviction we thought youd left us everyone thought you were riding with everyone else and then wwwwhen we stopped i sort of caught up i think mr trestle wants you to come and look at the university were here he said and gave her an odd look youre here yes how mr treatle invited me in he said everyone would be astounded to meet me uncertainty flashed a fin in the depths of her eyes was he right simon looked down at his book and dabbed at his running eyes with a red handkerchief he has tthese little ffancies he muttered bbbut hes not a bad person bewildered esk looked down at the yellowed pages open in front of the boy they were full of complicated red and black symbols which in some inexplicable way were as potent and unpleasant as a ticking parcel but which nevertheless drew the eye in the same way that a really bad accident does one felt that one would like to know their purpose while at the same time suspecting that if you found out you would really prefer not to have done simon saw her expression and hastily shut the book just some magic he mumbled something im wwwww working said esk automatically thank you on it must be quite interesting reading books said esk sort of cant you read esk the astonishment in his voice stung her i expect so she said defiantly ive never tried esk wouldnt have known what a collective noun was if it had spat in her eye but she knew there was a herd of goats and a coven of witches she didnt know what you called a lot of wizards an order of wizards a conspiracy a circle whatever it was it filled the university wizards strolled among the cloisters and sat on benches under the trees young wizards scuttled along pathways as bells rang with their arms full of books or in the case of senior students with their books flapping through the air after them the air had the greasy feel of magic and tasted of tin esk walked along between trestle and simon and drank it all in it wasnt just that there was magic in the air but it was tamed and working like a millrace it was power but it was harnessed simon was as excited as she was but it showed only because his eyes watered more and his stutter got worse he kept stopping to point out the various colleges and research buildings one was quite low and brooding with high narrow windows tthats the lllibrary said simon his voice bursting with wonder and respect can i have a lllook plenty of time for that later said treatle simon gave the building a wistful look all the bbooks of magic ever written he whispered why are the windows barred said esk simon swallowed um bbecause bbooks of mmagic arent like other bbooks they lead a thats enough snapped treatle he looked down at esk as if he had just noticed her and frowned why are you here you invited me in said esk me oh yes of course sorry mind wandering the young lady who wants to be a wizard let us see shall we he led the way up a broad flight of steps to an impressive pair of doors at least they were designed to be impressive the designer had invested deeply in heavy locks curly hinges brass studs and an intricatelycarved archway to make it absolutely clear to anyone entering that they were not very important people at all he was a wizard he had forgotten the doorknocker treatle rapped on the door with his staff it hesitated for a while and then slowly slid back its bolts and swung open the hall was full of wizards and boys and boys parents there are two ways of getting into unseen university in fact there are three but at this time wizards hadnt realised it the first is to achieve some great work of magic such as the recovery of an ancient and powerful relic or the invention of a totally new spell but in these times it was seldom done in the past there had been great wizards capable of forming whole new spells from the chaotic raw magic of the world wizards from whom as it were all the spells of wizardry had flowed but those days had gone there were no more sourcerers so the more typical method was to be sponsored by a senior and respected wizard after a suitable period of apprenticeship competition was stiff for a university place and the honour and privileges an unseen degree could bring many of the boys milling around the hall and launching minor spells at each other would fail and have to spend their lives as lowly magicians mere magical technologists with defiant beards and leather patches on their elbows who congregated in small jealous groups at parties not for them the coveted pointy hat with optional astrological symbols or the impressive robes or the staff of authority but at least they could look down on conjurers who tended to be jolly and fat and inclined to drop their aitches and drink beer and go around with sad thin women in spangly tights and really infuriate magicians by not realising how lowly they were and kept telling them jokes lowliest of all apart from witches of course were thaumaturgists who never got any schooling at all a thaumaturgist could just about be trusted to wash out an alembic many spells required things like mould from a corpse dead of crushing or the semen of a living tiger or the root of a plant that gave an ultrasonic scream when it was uprooted who was sent to get them right it is a common error to refer to the lower magical ranks as hedge wizards in fact hedge wizardry is a very honoured and specialised form of magic that attracts silent thoughtful men of the druidical persuasion and topiaric inclinations if you invited a hedge wizard to a party he would spend half the evening talking to your potted plant and he would spend the other half listening esk noticed that there were some women in the hall because even young wizards had mothers and sisters whole families had turned up to bid the favoured sons farewell there was a considerable blowing of noses wiping of tears and the clink of coins as proud fathers tucked a little spending money into their offsprings hands very senior wizards were perambulating among the crowds talking to the sponsoring wizards and examining the prospective students several of them pushed through the throng to meet treatle moving like goldtrimmed galleons under full sail they bowed gravely to him and looked approvingly at simon this is young simon is it said the fattest of them beaming at the boy weve heard great reports of you young man eh what simon bow to archchancellor cutangle archmage of the wizards of the silver star said treatle simon bowed apprehensively cutangle looked at him benevolently weve heard great things about you my boy he said all this mountain air must be good for the brain eh he laughed the wizards around him laughed treatle laughed which esk thought was rather funny because there wasnt anything particularly amusing happening i ddddont know ssss from what we hear it must be the only thing you dont know lad said cutangle his jowls waggling there was another carefully timed bout of laughter cutangle patted simon on the shoulder this is the scholarship boy he said quite astounding results never seen better selftaught too astonishing what isnt that so treatle superb archchancellor cutangle looked around at the watching wizards perhaps you could give us a sample he said a little demonstration perhaps simon looked at him in animal panic aactually im not very ggg now now said cutangle in what he probably really did think was an encouraging tone of voice do not be afraid take your time when you are ready simon licked his dry lips and gave treatle a look of mute appeal um he said yyou ssss he stopped and swallowed hard the ffff his eyes bulged the tears streamed from his eyes and his shoulders heaved treatle patted him reassuringly on the back hayfever he explained dont seem to be able to cure it tried everything simon swallowed and nodded he waved treatle away with his long white hands and closed his eyes for a few seconds nothing happened he stood with his lips moving soundlessly and then silence spread out from him like candlelight ripples of noiselessness washed across the crowds in the hall striking the walls with all the force of a blown kiss and then curling back in waves people watched their companions mouthing silently and then went red with effort when their own laughter was as audible as a gnats squeak tiny motes of light winked into existence around his head they whirled and spiralled in a complex threedimensional dance and then formed a shape in fact it seemed to esk that the shape had been there all the time waiting for her eyes to see it in the same way that a perfectly innocent cloud can suddenly become without changing in any way a whale or a ship or a face the shape around simons head was the world that was quite clear although the glitter and rush of the little lights blurred some of the detail but there was great atuin the sky turtle with the four elephants on its back and on them the disc itself there was the sparkle of the great waterfall around the edge of the world and there at the very hub a tiny needle of rock that was the great mountain cori celesti where the gods lived the image expanded and homed in on the circle sea and then on ankh itself the little lights flowing away from simon and winking out of existence a few feet from his head now they showed the city from the air rushing towards the watchers there was the university itself growing larger there was the great hall there were the people watching silent and openmouthed and simon himself outlined in specks of silver light and a tiny sparkling image in the air around him and that image contained an image and another and another there was a feeling that the universe had been turned inside out in all dimensions at once it was a bloated swollen sensation it sounded as though the whole world had said gloop the walls faded so did the floor the paintings of former great mages all scrolls and beards and slightly constipated frowns vanished the tiles underfoot a rather nice black and white pattern evaporated to be replaced by fine sand grey as moonlight and cold as ice strange and unexpected stars glittered overhead on the horizon were low hills eroded not by wind or rain in this weatherless place but by the soft sandpaper of time itself no one else seemed to have noticed no one else in fact seemed alive esk was surrounded by people as still and silent as statues and they werent alone there were otherthingsbehind them and more were appearing all the time they had no shape or rather they seemed to be taking their shapes at random from a variety of creatures they gave the impression that they had heard about arms and legs and jaws and claws and organs but didnt really know how they all fitted together or didnt care or were so hungry they hadnt bothered to find out they made a sound like a swarm of flies they were the creatures out of her dreams come to feed on magic she knew they werent interested in her now except in the nature of an afterdinner mint their whole concentration was focused on simon who was totally unaware of their presence esk kicked him smartly on the ankle the cold desert vanished the real world rushed back simon opened his eyes smiled faintly and gently fell backwards into esks arms a buzz went up from the wizards and several of them started to clap no one seemed to have noticed anything odd apart from the silver lights cutangle shook himself and raised a hand to quell the crowd quite astonishing he said to treatle you say he worked it out all by himself indeed lord no one helped him at all there was no one to help him said treatle he was just wandering from village to village doing small spells but only if people paid him in books or paper cutangle nodded it was no illusion he said yet he didnt use his hands what was he saying to himself do you know he says its just words to make his mind work properly said treatle and shrugged i cant understand half of what he says and thats a fact he says hes having to invent words because there arent any for the things hes doing cutangle glanced sideways at his fellow mages they nodded it will be an honour to admit him to the university he said perhaps you would tell him so when he wakes up he felt a tugging at his robe and looked down excuse me said esk hallo young lady said cutangle in a sugarmouse voice have you come to see your brother enter the university hes not my brother said esk there were times when the world had seemed to be full of brothers but this wasnt one of them are you important she said cutangle looked at his colleagues and beamed there were fashions in wizardry just like anything else sometimes wizards were thin and gaunt and talked to animals while at other times they tended towards the dark and saturnine with little black pointed beards currently aldermanic was in cutangle swelled with modesty quite important he said one does ones best in the service of ones fellow man yes quite important i would say i want to be a wizard said esk the lesser wizards behind cutangle stared at her as if she was a new and interesting kind of beetle cutangles face went red and his eyes bulged he looked down at esk and seemed to be holding his breath then he started to laugh it started somewhere down in his extensive stomach regions and worked its way up echoing from rib to rib and causing minor wizardquakes across his chest until it burst forth in a series of strangled snorts it was quite fascinating to watch that laugh it had a personality all of its own but he stopped when he saw esks stare if the laugh was a music hall clown then esks determined squint was a whitewash bucket on a fast trajectory a wizard he said you want to be a wizard yes said esk pushing the dazed simon into trestles reluctant arms im the eighth son of an eighth son i mean daughter the wizards around her were looking at one another and whispering esk tried to ignore them what did she say is she serious i always think children are so delightful at that age dont you youre the eighth son of an eighth daughter said cutangle really the other way around only not exactly said esk defiantly cutangle dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief this is quite fascinating he said i dont think ive ever heard of something quite like this before eh he looked around at his growing audience the people at the back couldnt see esk and were craning to check if some interesting magic was going on cutangle was at a loss well now he said you want to be a wizard i keep telling everyone but no one seems to listen said esk how old are you little girl nearly nine and you want to be a wizard when you grow up i want to be a wizard now said esk firmly this is the right place isnt it cutangle looked at trestle and winked i saw that said esk i dont think theres ever been a lady wizard before said cutangle i rather think it might be against the lore wouldnt you rather be a witch i understand its a fine career for girls a minor wizard behind him started to laugh esk gave him a look being a witch is quite good she conceded but i think wizards have more fun what do you think i think you are a very singular little girl said cutangle what does that mean it means theres only one of you said trestle thats right said esk and i still want to be a wizard words failed cutangle well you cant he said the very idea he drew himself up to his full width and turned away something tugged at his robe why not said a voice he turned because he said slowly and deliberately because the whole idea is completely laughable thats why and its absolutely against the lore but i can do wizard magic said esk the faintest suggestion of a tremble in her voice cutangle bent down until his face was level with hers no you cant he hissed because you are not a wizard women arent wizards do i make myself clear watch said esk she extended her right hand with the fingers spread and sighted along it until she spotted the statue of malich the wise the founder of the university instinctively the wizards between her and it edged out of the way and then felt rather silly i mean it she said go away little girl said cutangle right said esk she squinted hard at the statue and concentrated the great doors of unseen university are made of octiron a metal so unstable that it can only exist in a universe saturated with raw magic they are impregnable to all force save magic no fire no battering ram no army can breach them which is why most ordinary visitors to the university use the back door which is made of perfectly normal wood and doesnt go around terrorising people or even stand still terrorising people it had a proper knocker and everything granny examined the doorposts carefully and gave a grunt of satisfaction when she spotted what she was looking for she hadnt doubted that it would be there cunningly concealed by the natural grain of the wood she grasped the knocker which was shaped like a dragons head and rapped smartly three times after a while the door was opened by a young woman with her mouth full of clothespegs ot o ont she enquired granny bowed giving the girl a chance to take in the pointy black hat with the batwing hatpins it had an impressive effect she blushed and peering out into the quiet alleyway hurriedly motioned granny inside there was a big mossy courtyard on the other side of the wall crisscrossed with washing lines granny had the chance to become one of the very few women to learn what it really is that wizards wear under their robes but modestly averted her eyes and followed the girl across the flagstones and down a wide flight of steps they led into a long high tunnel lined with archways and currently full of steam granny caught sight of long lines of washtubs in the big rooms off to the sides the air had the warm fat smell of ironing a gaggle of girls carrying washbaskets pushed past her and hurried up the steps then stopped halfway up and turned slowly to look at her granny set her shoulders back and tried to look as mysterious as possible her guide who still hadnt got rid of her clothespegs led her down a sidepassage into a room that was a maze of shelves piled with laundry in the very centre of the maze sitting at a table was a very fat woman with a ginger wig she had been writing in a very large laundry bookit was still open in front of herbut was currently inspecting a large stained vest have you tried bleaching she asked yes mm said the maid beside her what about tincture of myrryt yes mm it just turned it blue mm well its a new one on me said the laundry woman and ayve seen brimstone and soot and dragon blood and demon blood and aye dont know what else she turned the vest over and read the nametape carefully sewn inside hmm granpone the white hes going to be granpone the grey if he doesnt take better care of his laundry aye tell you girl a white magician is just a black magician with a good housekeeper take it she caught sight of granny and stopped ee ocked hat hee oor said grannys guide dropping a hurried curtsey oo ed hat yes yes thank you ksandra you may go said the fat woman she stood up and beamed at granny and with an almost perceptible click wound her voice up several social classes pray hexcuse us she said you find us hall at sixes and sevens it being washing day and heverything his this a courtesy call or may i make so bold as to ask she lowered her voice his there a message from the hother sade granny looked blank but only a fraction of a second the witchmarks on the doorpost had said that the housekeeper welcomed witches and was particularly anxious for news of her four husbands she was also in random pursuit of a fifth hence the ginger wig and if grannys ears werent deceiving her the creak of enough whalebone to infuriate an entire ecology movement gullible and foolish the signs had said granny withheld judgment because city witches didnt seem that bright themselves the housekeeper must have mistaken her expression dont be afraid she said may staff have distinct instructions to welcome witches although of course they upstairs dont approve no doubt you would like a cup of tea and something to eat granny bowed solemnly and aye will see if we cant find a nice bundle of old clothes for you too the housekeeper beamed old clothes oh yes thank you mm the housekeeper swept forward with a sound like an elderly tea clipper in a gale and beckoned granny to follow her ayell have the tea brought to my flat tea with a lot of tealeaves granny stumped along after her old clothes did this fat woman really mean it the nerve of course if they were good quality there seemed to be a whole world under the university it was a maze of cellars coldrooms stillrooms kitchens and sculleries and every inhabitant was either carrying something pumping something pushing something or just standing around and shouting granny caught glimpses of rooms full of ice and others glowing with the heat from redhot cooking stoves wallsized bakeries smelled of new bread and taprooms smelled of old beer everything smelled of sweat and woodsmoke the housekeeper led her up an old spiral staircase and unlocked the door with one of the large number of keys that hung from her belt the room inside was pink and frilly there were frills on things that no one in their right mind would frill it was like being inside candyfloss very nice said granny and because she felt it was expected of her tasteful she looked around for something unfrilly to sit on and gave up whatever am aye thinking of the housekeeper trilled ayem mrs whitlow but i expect you know of course and aye have the honour to be addressing eh oh granny weatherwax said granny the frills were getting to her they gave pink a bad name aym psychic myself of course said mrs whitlow granny had nothing against fortunetelling provided it was done badly by people with no talent for it it was a different matter if people who ought to know better did it though she considered that the future was a frail enough thing at best and if people looked at it hard they changed it granny had some quite complex theories about space and time and why they shouldnt be tinkered with but fortunately good fortunetellers were rare and anyway people preferred bad fortunetellers who could be relied upon for the correct dose of uplift and optimism granny knew all about bad fortunetelling it was harder than the real thing you needed a good imagination she couldnt help wondering if mrs whitlow was a born witch who somehow missed her training she was certainly laying siege to the future there was a crystal ball under a sort of pink frilly tea cosy and several sets of divinatory cards and a pink velvet bag of rune stones and one of those little tables on wheels that no prudent witch would touch with a tenfoot broomstick and granny wasnt sure on this point either some special dried monkey turds from a llamassary or some dried llama turds from a monastery which apparently could be thrown in such a way as to reveal the sum total of knowledge and wisdom in the universe it was all rather sad or theres the tealeaves of course said mrs whitlow indicating the big brown pot on the table between them aye know witches often prefer them but they always seem so well common to me no offence meant there probably wasnt any offence meant at that thought granny mrs whitlow was giving her the sort of look generally used by puppies when theyre not sure what to expect next and are beginning to worry that it may be the rolledup newspaper she picked up mrs whitlows cup and had started to peer into it when she caught the disappointed expression that floated across the housekeepers face like a shadow across a snowfield then she remembered what she was doing and turned the cup widdershins three times made a few vague passes over it and mumbled a charm which she normally used to cure mastitis in elderly goats but never mind this display of obvious magical talent seemed to cheer up mrs whitlow no end granny wasnt normally very good at tealeaves but she squinted at the sugarencrusted mess at the bottom of the cup and let her mind wander what she really needed now was a handy rat or even a cockroach that happened to be somewhere near esk so that she could borrow its mind what granny actually found was that the university had a mind of its own it is well known that stone can think because the whole of electronics is based on that fact but in some universes men spend ages looking for other intelligences in the sky without once looking under their feet that is because theyve got the timespan all wrong from stones point of view the universe is hardly created and mountain ranges are bouncing up and down like organstops while continents zip backwards and forwards in general high spirits crashing into each other from the sheer joy of momentum and getting their rocks off it is going to be quite some time before stone notices its disfiguring little skin disease and starts to scratch which is just as well the rocks from which unseen university was built however have been absorbing magic for several thousand years and all that random power has had to go somewhere the university has in fact developed a personality granny could sense it like a big and quite friendly animal just waiting to roll over on its roof and have its floor scratched it was paying no attention to her however it was watching esk granny found the child by following the threads of the universitys attention and watched in fascination as the scenes unfolded in the great hall in there the voice came from a long way away mmph aye said what do you see in there repeated mrs whitlow eh aye said what do oh granny reeled her mind in quite confused the trouble with borrowing another mind was you always felt out of place when you got back to your own body and granny was the first person ever to read the mind of a building now she was feeling big and gritty and full of passages are you all right granny nodded and opened her windows she extended her east and west wings and tried to concentrate on the tiny cup held in her pillars fortunately mrs whitlow put her plaster complexion and stony silence down to occult powers at work while granny found that a brief exposure to the vast silicon memory of the university had quite stimulated her imagination in a voice like a draughty corridor which made the housekeeper very impressed she wove a future full of keen young men fighting for mrs whitlows ample favours she also spoke very quickly because what she had seen in the great hall made her anxious to go around to the main gates again there is another thing she added yes yes i see you hiring a new servant you do hire the servants here dont you right and this one is a young girl very economical very good worker can turn her hand to anything what about her then said mrs whitlow already savouring grannys surprisingly graphic descriptions of her future and drunk with curiosity the spirits are a little unclear on this point said granny but it is very important that you hire her no problem there said mrs whitlow cant keep servants here you know not for long its all the magic it leaks down here you know especially from the library where they keep all them magical books two of the top floor maids walked out yesterday actually they said they were fed up going to bed not knowing what shape they would wake up in the morning the senior wizards turn them back you know but its not the same yes well the spirits say this young lady wont be any trouble as far as that is concerned said granny grimly if she can sweep and scrub shes welcome ayem sure said mrs whitlow looking puzzled she even brings her own broom according to the spirits that is how very helpful when is this young lady going to arrive oh soon soon thats what the spirits say a faint suspicion clouded the housekeepers face this isnt the sort of thing spirits normally say where do they say that exactly here said granny look the little cluster of tealeaves between the sugar and this crack here am i right their eyes met mrs whitlow might have had her weaknesses but she was quite tough enough to rule the belowstairs world of the university however granny could outstare a snake after a few seconds the housekeepers eyes began to water yes aye expect you are she said meekly and fished a handkerchief from the recesses of her bosom well then said granny sitting back and replacing the teacup in its saucer there are plenty of opportunities here for a young woman willing to work hard said mrs whitlow aye myself started as a maid you know we all do said granny vaguely and now i must be going she stood up and reached for her hat but must hurry urgent appointment said granny over her shoulder as she hurried down the steps theres a bundle of old clothes granny paused her instincts battling for mastery any black velvet yes and some silk granny wasnt sure she approved of silk shed heard it came out of a caterpillars bottom but black velvet had a powerful attraction loyalty won put it on one side i may call again she shouted and ran down the corridor cooks and scullery maids darted for cover as the old woman pounded along the slippery flagstones leapt up the stairs to the courtyard and skidded out into the lane her shawl flying out behind her and her boots striking sparks from the cobbles once out into the open she hitched up her skirts and broke into a full gallop turning the corner into the main square in a screeching twoboot drift that left a long white scratch across the stones she was just in time to see esk come running through the gates in tears the magic just wouldnt work i could feel it there but it just wouldnt come out perhaps you were trying too hard said granny magics like fishing jumping around and splashing never caught any fish you have to bide quiet and let it happen natural and then everyone laughed at me someone even gave me a sweet you got some profit out of the day then said granny granny said esk accusingly well what did you expect she asked at least they only laughed at you laughter dont hurt you walked up to chief wizard and showed off in front of everyone and only got laughed at youre doing well you are have you eaten the sweet esk scowled yes what kind was it toffee cant abide toffee huh said esk i suppose you want me to get peppermint next time dont you sarky me youngfellowmelass nothing wrong with peppermint pass me that bowl another advantage of city life granny had discovered was glassware some of her more complicated potions required apparatus which either had to be bought from the dwarves at extortionate rates or if ordered from the nearest human glassblower arrived in straw and usually pieces she had tried blowing her own and the effort always made her cough which produced some very funny results but the citys thriving alchemy profession meant that there were whole shops full of glass for the buying and a witch could always arrange bargain prices she watched carefully as yellow steam surged along a twisty maze of tubing and eventually condensed as one large sticky droplet she caught it neatly on the end of a glass spoon and very carefully tipped it into a tiny glass phial esk watched her through her tears whats that she asked its a neveryoumind said granny sealing the phials cork with wax a medicine in a manner of speaking granny pulled her writing set towards her and selected a pen her tongue stuck out of the corner of her mouth as she very carefully wrote out a label with much scratching and pausing to work out the spellings whos it for mrs herapath the glassblowers wife esk blew her nose hes the one who doesnt blow much glass isnt he granny looked at her over the top of the desk how do you mean when she was talking to you yesterday she called him old mister once a fortnight mmph said granny she carefully finished the sentence dylewt in won pint warter and won droppe in hys tee and be shure to wear loose clowthing allso that no vysitors exspected one day she told herself im going to have to have that talk with her the child seemed curiously dense she had already assisted at enough births and taken the goats to old nanny annaples billy without drawing any obvious conclusions granny wasnt quite certain what she should do about it but the time never seemed appropriate to bring up the subject she wondered whether in her hearts of hearts she was too embarrassed she felt like a farrier who could shoe horses cure them rear them and judge them but had only the sketchiest idea about how one rode them she pasted the label on to the phial and wrapped it carefully in plain paper now there is another way into the university she said looking sidelong at esk who was making a disgruntled job of mashing herbs in a mortar a witches way esk looked up granny treated herself to a thin smile and started work on another label writing labels was always the hard part of magic as far as she was concerned but i dont expect youd be interested she went on its not very glamorous they laughed at me esk mumbled yes you said so you wont be wanting to try again then i quite understand there was silence broken only by the scratching of grannys pen eventually esk said this way mmph itll get me into the university of course said granny haughtily i said id find a way didnt i a very good way too you wont have to bother with lessons you can go all over the place no one will notice you youll be invisible really and well you can really clean up but of course after all that laughing you wont be interested will you pray have another cup of tea mrs weatherwax said mrs whitlow mistress said granny pardon its mistress weatherwax said granny three sugars please mrs whitlow pushed the bowl towards her much as she looked forward to grannys visits it came expensive in sugar sugar lumps never seemed to last long around granny very bad for the figure she said and the teeth so aye hear i never had a figure to speak of and my teeth take care of themselves said granny it was true mores the pity granny suffered from robustly healthy teeth which she considered a big drawback in a witch she really envied nanny annaple the witch over the mountain who managed to lose all her teeth by the time she was twenty and had real cronecredibility it meant you ate a lot of soup but you also got a lot of respect and then there was warts without any effort nanny managed to get a face like a sockful of marbles while granny had tried every reputable wartcauser and failed to raise even the obligatory nose wart some witches had all the luck mmph she said aware of mrs whitlows fluting aye said said mrs whitlow that young eskarina is a real treasure quate the little find she keeps the floors spotless spotless no task too big aye said to her yesterday aye said that broom of yours might as well have a life of its own and do you know what she said i couldnt even venture a guess said granny weakly she said the dust was afraid of it can you imagine yes said granny mrs whitlow pushed her teacup towards her and gave her an embarrassed smile granny sighed inwardly and squinted into the nonetooclean depths of the future she was definitely beginning to run out of imagination the broom whisked down the corridor raising a great cloud of dust which if you looked hard at it seemed somehow to be sucked back into the broomstick if you looked even harder youd see that the broom handle had strange markings on it which were not so much carved as clinging and somehow changed shape as you watched but no one looked esk sat at one of the high deep windows and stared out over the city she was feeling angrier than usual so the broom attacked the dust with unusual vigour spiders ran desperate eightlegged dashes for safety as ancestral cobwebs disappeared into the void in the walls mice clung to each other legs braced against the inside of their holes woodworm scrabbled in the ceiling beams as they were drawn inexorably backwards down their tunnels you can really clean up said esk huh there were some good points she had to admit the food was simple but there was plenty of it and she had a room to herself somewhere in the roof and it was quite luxurious because here she could lie in until five a m which to grannys way of thinking was practically noon the work certainly wasnt hard she just started sweeping until the staff realised what was expected of it and then she could amuse herself until it was finished if anyone came the staff would immediately lean itself nonchalantly against a wall but she wasnt learning any wizardry she could wander into empty classrooms and look at the diagrams chalked on the board and on the floor too in the more advanced classes but the shapes were meaningless and unpleasant they reminded esk of the pictures in simons book they looked alive she gazed out across the rooftops of ankhmorpork and reasoned like this writing was only the words that people said squeezed between layers of paper until they were fossilized fossils were wellknown on the discworld great spiralled shells and badlyconstructed creatures that were left over from the time when the creator hadnt really decided what he wanted to make and was as it were just idly messing around with the pleistocene and the words people said were just shadows of real things but some things were too big to be really trapped in words and even the words were too powerful to be completely tamed by writing so it followed that some writing was actually trying to become things esks thoughts became confused things at this point but she was certain that the really magic words were the ones that pulsed angrily trying to escape and become real they didnt look very nice but then she remembered the previous day it had been rather odd the university classrooms were designed on the funnel principle with tiers of seats polished by the bottoms of the discs greatest mages looking precipitously down into a central area where there was a workbench a couple of blackboards and enough floor space for a decentsized instructional octogram there was a lot of dead space under the tiers and esk had found it a quite useful observation post peering around between the apprentice wizards pointy boots at the instructor it was very restful with the droning of the lecturers drifting over her as gently as the buzzing of the slightly zonked bees in grannys special herb garden there never seemed to be any practical magic it always seemed to be just words wizards seemed to like words but yesterday had been different esk had been sitting in the dusty gloom trying to do even some very simple magic when she heard the door open and boots clump across the floor that was surprising in itself esk knew the timetable and the second year students who normally occupied this room were down for beginners dematerialisation with jeophal the spry in the gym esk peeped between the slats these werent students they were wizards quite high ones to judge by their robes and there was no mistaking the figure that climbed on to the lecturers dais like a badlystrung puppet bumping heavily into the lectern and absentmindedly apologising to it it was simon no one else had eyes like two raw eggs in warm water and a dose bright red from blowing for simon the pollen count always went to infinity it occurred to esk that minus his general allergy to the whole of creation and with a decent haircut and a few lessons in deportment the boy could look quite handsome it was an unusual thought and she squirrelled it away for future consideration when the wizards had settled down simon began to talk he read from notes and every time he stuttered over a word the wizards as one man without being able to stop themselves chorused it for him after a while a stick of chalk rose from the lectern and started to write on the blackboard behind him esk had picked up enough about wizard magic to know that this was an astounding achievement simon had been at the university for a couple of weeks and most students hadnt mastered light levitation by the end of their second year the little white stub skittered and squeaked across the blackness to the accompaniment of simons voice even allowing for the stutter he was not a very good speaker he dropped notes he corrected himself he ummed and ahhed and as far as esk was concerned he wasnt saying anything very much phrases filtered down to her hiding place basic fabric of the universe was one and she didnt understand what that was unless he meant denim or maybe flannelette mutability of the possibility matrix she couldnt guess at all sometimes he seemed to be saying that nothing existed unless people thought it did and the world was really only there at all because people kept on imagining it but then he seemed to be saying that there was lots of worlds all nearly the same and all sort of occupying the same place but all separated by the thickness of a shadow so that everything that ever could happen would have somewhere to happen in there was something disturbing about the phrases simon used half the time he seemed to be saying that the world was about as real as a soap bubble or a dream the chalk shrieked its way across the board behind him sometimes simon had to stop and explain symbols to the wizards who seemed to esk to be getting excited at some very silly sentences then the chalk would start again curving across the darkness like a comet trailing its dust behind it the light was fading out of the sky outside as the room grew more gloomy the chalked words glowed and the blackboard appeared to esk to be not so much dark as simply not there at all but just a square hole cut out of the world simon talked on about the world being made up of tiny things whose presence could only be determined by the fact that they were not there little spinning balls of nothingness that magic could shunt together to make stars and butterflies and diamonds everything was made up of emptiness the funny thing was he seemed to find this fascinating esk was only aware that the walls of the room grew as thin and insubstantial as smoke as if the emptiness in them was expanding to swallow whatever it was that defined them as walls and instead there was nothing but the familiar cold empty glittering plain with its distant worn hills and the creatures that stood as still as statues looking down there were a lot more of them now they seemed for all the world to be clustering like moths around a light one important difference was that a moths face even close up was as friendly as a bunny rabbits compared to the things watching simon then a servant came in to light the lamps and the creatures vanished turning into perfectly harmless shadows that lurked in the corners of the room at some time in the recent past someone had decided to brighten the ancient corridors of the university by painting them having some vague notion that learning should be fun it hadnt worked its a fact known throughout the universes that no matter how carefully the colours are chosen institutional decor ends up as either vomit green unmentionable brown nicotine yellow or surgical appliance pink by some little understood process of sympathetic resonance corridors painted in those colours always smell slightly of boiled cabbageeven if no cabbage is ever cooked in the vicinity somewhere in the corridors a bell rang esk dropped lightly from her windowsill grabbed the staff and started to sweep industriously as doors were flung open and the corridors filled with students they streamed past her on two sides like water around a rock for a few minutes there was utter confusion then doors slammed a few laggard feet pattered away in the distance and esk was by herself again not for the first time esk wished that the staff could talk the other servants were friendly enough but you couldnt talk to them not about magic anyway she was also coming to the conclusion that she ought to learn to read this reading business seemed to be the key to wizard magic which was all about words wizards seemed to think that names were the same as things and that if you changed the name you changed the thing at least it seemed to be something like that reading that meant the library simon had said there were thousands of books in it and amongst all those words there were bound to be one or two she could read esk put the staff over her shoulder and set off resolutely for mrs whitlows office she was nearly there when a wall said psst when esk stared at it it turned out to be granny it wasnt that granny could make herself invisible it was just that she had this talent for being able to fade into the foreground so that she wasnt noticed how are you getting on then asked granny hows the magic coming along what are you doing here granny said esk been to tell mrs whitlow her fortune said granny holding up a large bundle of old clothes with some satisfaction her smile faded under esks stern gaze well things are different in the city she said city people are always worried about the future it comes from eating unnatural food anyway she added suddenly realising that she was whining why shouldnt i tell fortunes you always said hilta was playing on the foolishness of her sex said esk you said that them as tell fortunes should be ashamed of themselves and anyway you dont need old clothes waste not want not said granny primly she had spent her entire life on the oldclothes standard and wasnt about to let temporary prosperity dislodge her are you getting enough to eat yes said esk granny about this wizard magic its all words always said it was said granny no i mean esk began but granny waved a hand irritably cant be bothered with this at the moment she said ive got some big orders to fill by tonight if it goes on like this im going to have to train someone up cant you come and see me when you get an afternoon off or whatever it is they give you train someone up said esk horrified you mean as a witch no said granny i mean perhaps but what about me well youre going your own way said granny wherever that is mmph said esk granny stared at her ill be off then she said at last she turned and strode off towards the kitchen entrance as she did so her cloak swirled out and esk saw that it was now lined with red a dark winy red but red nevertheless on granny who had never been known to wear any visible clothing that was other than a serviceable black it was quite shocking the library said mrs whitlow aye dont think anyone cleans the library she looked genuinely puzzled why said esk doesnt it get dusty well said mrs whitlow she thought for a while aye suppose it must do since you come to mention it aye never really thought about it you see ive cleaned everywhere else said esk sweetly yes said mrs whitlow you have havent you well then its just that weve never done it before said mrs whitlow but for the life of me aye cant think why well then said esk ook said the head librarian and backed away from esk but she had heard about him and had come prepared she offered him a banana the orangoutan reached out slowly and then snatched it with a grin of triumph there may be universes where librarianship is considered a peaceful sort of occupation and where the risks are limited to large volumes falling off the shelves on to ones head but the keeper of a magic library is no job for the unwary spells have power and merely writing them down and shoving them between covers doesnt do anything to reduce it the stuff leaks books tend to react with one another creating randomised magic with a mind of its own books of magic are usually chained to their shelves but not to prevent them being stolen one such accident had turned the librarian into an ape since when he had resisted all attempts to turn him back explaining in sign language that life as an orangoutan was considerably better than life as a human being because all the big philosophical questions resolved themselves into wondering where the next banana was coming from anyway long arms and prehensile feet were ideal for dealing with high shelves esk gave him the whole bunch of bananas and scurried away amongst the books before he could object esk had never seen more than one book at a time and so the library was for all she knew just like any other library true it was a bit odd the way the floor seemed to become the wall in the distance and there was something strange about the way the shelves played tricks on the eyes and seemed to twist through rather more dimensions than the normal three and it was quite surprising to look up and see shelves on the ceiling with the occasional student wandering unconcernedly among them the truth was that the presence of so much magic distorted the space around it down in the stacks the very denim or possibly flannelette of the universe was tortured into very peculiar shapes the millions of trapped words unable to escape bent reality around them it seemed logical to esk that among all these books should be one that told you how to read all the others she wasnt sure how to find it but deep in her soul she felt it would probably have pictures of cheerful rabbits and happy kittens on the cover the library certainly wasnt silent there was the occasional zip and sizzle of a magical discharge and an octarine spark would flash from shelf to shelf chains clinked faintly and of course there was the faint rustle of thousands of pages in their leatherbound prisons esk made sure no one was paying her any attention and pulled at the nearest volume it sprang open in her hands and she saw gloomily that there were the same unpleasant types of diagram that she had noticed in simons book the writing was entirely unfamiliar and she was glad about that it would be horrible to know what all those letters which seemed to be made up of ugly creatures doing complicated things to each other actually meant she forced the cover shut even though the words seemed to be desperately pushing back there was a drawing of a creature on the front it looked suspiciously like one of the things from the cold desert it certainly didnt look like a happy kitten hallo esk isnt it hhow ddid you get hhere it was simon standing there with a book under each arm esk blushed granny wont tell me she said i think its something to do with men and women simon looked at her blankly then he grinned esk thought about the question a second time i work here i sweep up she waved the staff in explanation inhere esk stared at him she felt alone and lost and more than a little betrayed everyone seemed to be busy living their own lives except her she would spend the rest of her life cleaning up after wizards it wasnt fair and shed had enough actually i dont actually im learning to read so i can be a wizard the boy regarded her through his damp eyes for some seconds then he gently took the book out of esks hands and read its title demonylogie malyfycorum of henchanse thee unsatyfactory how did you think you could learn to rread this um said esk well you just keep trying until you can dont you like milking or knitting or her voice faded away i dont know about that these books can be a bit well aggressive if you ddont be careful they start reading you what do you mean tthey ssss say said esk automatically that there was once a wwww wizard who started to rread the necrotelecomnicon and let his mmind wwwwww wander and next morning they ffound all his clothes on the chair and hhis hat on ttop of them and the bbook had esk put her fingers in her ears but not too hard in case she missed anything i dont want to know about it if its horrid had a lot more pages esk took her fingers out of her ears was there anything on the pages simon nodded solemnly yes on every sssingle one of ththem there www no said esk i dont even want to imagine it i thought reading was more peaceful than that i mean granny read her almanack every day and nothing ever happened to her i ddaresay ordinary tame www words are all right simon conceded magnanimously are you absolutely certain said esk its just that words can have power said simon slotting the book firmly back on its shelf where it rattled its chains at him and they do say the ppen is mightier than the sss sword said esk all right but which would you rather be hit with um i ddont think its any use mme ttelling you you shouldnt be in here is it said the young wizard esk gave this due consideration no she said i dont think it is i could send for the pporters and have you ttaken away yes but you wont i just ddont www want you to get hurt you see i rreally dont this can bbe a ddddangerou esk caught a faint swirling in the air above his head for a moment she saw them the great grey shapes from the cold place watching and in the calm of the library when the weight of magic was wearing the universe particularly thin they had decided to act around her the muted rustling of the books rose to a desperate riffling of pages some of the more powerful books managed to jerk out of their shelves and swung flapping madly from the end of their chains a huge grimoire plunged from its eyrie on the topmost shelf tearing itself free of its chain in the process and flopped away like a frightened chicken scattering its pages behind it a magical wind blew away esks headscarf and her hair streamed out behind her she saw simon trying to steady himself against a bookshelf as books exploded around him the air was thick and tasted of tin it buzzed theyre trying to get in she screamed simons tortured face turned to her a fearcrazed incunable hit him heavily in the small of the back and knocked him to the heaving floor before it bounced high over the shelves esk ducked as a flock of thesauri wheeled past towing their shelf behind them and scuttled on hands and knees towards him thats whats making the books so frightened she shrieked in his ear cant you see them up there simon mutely shook his head a book burst its bindings over them showering them in pages horror can steal into the mind via all the senses theres the sound of the little meaningful chuckle in the locked dark room the sight of half a caterpillar in your forkful of salad the curious smell from the lodgers bedroom the taste of slug in the cauliflower cheese touch doesnt normally get a lookin but something happened to the floor under esks hands she looked down her face a rictus of horror because the dusty floorboards suddenly felt gritty and dry and very very cold there was fine silver sand between her fingers she grabbed the staff and sheltering her eyes against the wind waved it at the towering figures above her it would have been nice to report that a searing flash of pure white fire cleansed the greasy air it failed to materialise the staff twisted like a snake in her hand and caught simon a crack on the side of the head the grey things wavered and vanished reality returned and tried to pretend that it had never left silence settled like thick velvet wave after wave of it a heavy echoing silence a few books dropped heavily out of the air feeling silly the floor under esks feet was undoubtedly wooden she kicked it hard to make sure there was blood on the floor and simon lay very quietly in the centre of it esk stared down at him and then up at the still air and then at the staff it looked smug she was aware of distant voices and hurrying feet a hand like a fine leather glove slipped gently into hers and a voice behind said ook very softly she turned and found herself staring down into the gentle innertube face of the librarian he put his finger to his lips in an unmistakable gesture and tugged gently at her hand ive killed him she whispered the librarian shook his head and tugged insistently ook he explained ook he dragged her reluctantly down a side alleyway in the maze of ancient shelving a few seconds before a party of senior wizards drawn by the noise rounded the corner the books have been fighting again oh no itll take ages to capture all the spells again you know they go and find places to hide whos that on the floor there was a pause hes knocked out a shelf caught him by the looks of it who is he that new lad you know the one they say has got a whole head full of brains if that shelf had been a bit closer wed be able to see if they were right you two get him along to the infirmary the rest of you better get these books rounded up wheres the damn librarian he ought to know better than to let a critical mass build up esk glanced sideways at the orangoutan who waggled his eyebrows at her he pulled a dusty volume of gardening spells out of the shelves beside him extracted a soft brown banana from the recess behind it and ate it with the quiet relish of one who knows that whatever the problems are they belong firmly to human beings she looked the other way at the staff in her hand and her lips went thin she knew her grip hadnt slipped the staff had lunged at simon with murder in its heartwood the boy lay on a hard bed in a narrow room a cold towel folded across his forehead treatle and cutangle watched him carefully how long has it been said cutangle trestle shrugged three days and he hasnt come around once no cutangle sat down heavily on the edge of the bed and pinched the bridge of his nose wearily simon had never looked particularly healthy but now his face had a horrible sunken look a brilliant mind that one he said his explanation of the fundamental principles of magic and matter quite astounding trestle nodded the way he just absorbs knowledge said cutangle ive been a working wizard all my life and somehow i never really understood magic until he explained it so clear so well obvious everyone says that said trestle gloomily they say its like having a hoodwink pulled off and seeing the daylight for the first time thats exactly it said cutangle hes sourcerer material sure enough you were right to bring him here there was a thoughtful pause only said trestle only what asked cutangle only what was it you understood said trestle thats whats bothering me i mean can you explain it how do you mean explain cutangle looked worried what he keeps talking about said trestle a hint of desperation in his voice oh its the genuine stuff i know but what exactly is it cutangle looked at him his mouth open eventually he said oh thats easy magic fills the universe you see and every time the universe changes no i mean every time magic is invoked the universe changes only in every direction at once dyou see and he moved his hands uncertainly trying to recognise a spark of comprehension in trestles face to put it another way any piece of matter like an orange or the world or or a crocodile suggested trestle yes a crocodile or whatever is basically shaped like a carrot i dont remember that bit said trestle im sure thats what he said said cutangle he was starting to sweat no i remember the bit where he seemed to suggest that if you went far enough in any direction you would see the back of your head trestle insisted youre sure he didnt mean someone elses head trestle thought for a bit no im pretty sure he said the back of your own head he said i think he said he could prove it they considered this in silence finally cutangle spoke very slowly and carefully i look at it all like this he said before i heard him talk i was like everyone else you know what i mean i was confused and uncertain about all the little details of life but now he brightened up while im still confused and uncertain its on a much higher plane dyou see and at least i know im bewildered about the really fundamental and important facts of the universe trestle nodded i hadnt looked at it like that he said but youre absolutely right hes really pushed back the boundaries of ignorance theres so much about the universe we dont know they both savoured the strange warm glow of being much more ignorant than ordinary people who were ignorant of only ordinary things then trestle said i just hope hes all right hes over the fever but he just doesnt seem to want to wake up a couple of servants came in with a bowl of water and fresh towels one of them carried a rather tatty broomstick as they began to change the sweatsoaked sheets under the boy the two wizards left still discussing the vast vistas of unknowingness that simons genius had revealed to the world granny waited until their footsteps had died away and took off her headscarf damn thing she said esk go and listen at the door she removed the towel from simons head and felt his temperature it was very good of you to come said esk and you so busy with your work and everything mmmph granny pursed her lips she pulled up simons eyelids and sought his pulse she laid an ear on his xylophone chest and listened to his heart she sat for some time quite motionless probing around inside his head she frowned is he all right said esk anxiously granny looked at the stone walls drat this place she said its no place for sick people yes but is he all right what granny was startled out of her thoughts oh yes probably wherever he is esk stared at her and then at simons body nobodys home said granny simply what do you mean listen to the child said granny youd think i taught her nothing i mean his minds wandering hes gone out of his head she looked at simons body with something verging on admiration quite surprisin really she added i never yet met a wizard who could borrow she turned to esk whose mouth was a horrified o i remember when i was a girl old nanny annaple went wanderin got too wrapped up with being a vixen as i recall took us days to find her and then there was you too i never would have found you if it wasnt for that staff thing and what have you done with it girl it hit him esk muttered it tried to kill him i threw it in the river not a nice thing to do to it after it saved you said granny it saved me by hitting him didnt you realise he was callin to them things thats not true granny stared into esks defiant eyes and the thought came to her mind ive lost her three years of work down the privy she couldnt be a wizard but she might have been a witch why isnt it true miss clever she said he wouldnt do something like that esk was near to tears i heard him speak hes well hes not evil hes a brilliant person he nearly understands how everything works hes i expect hes a very nice boy said granny sourly i never said he was a black wizard did i theyre horrible things esk sobbed he wouldnt call out to them he wants everything that theyre not and youre a wicked old the slap rang like a bell esk staggered back white with shock granny stood with her hand upraised trembling shed struck esk once before the blow a baby gets to introduce it to the world and give it a rough idea of what to expect from life but that had been the last time in three years under the same roof there had been cause enough when milk had been left to boil over or the goats had been carelessly left without water but a sharp word or a sharper silence had done more than force ever could and left no bruises she grabbed esk firmly by the shoulders and stared into her eyes listen to me she said urgently didnt i always say to you that if you use magic you should go through the world like a knife goes through water didnt i say that esk mesmerised like a cornered rabbit nodded and you thought that was just old grannys way didnt you but the fact is that if you use magic you draw attention to yourself from them they watch the world all the time ordinary minds are just vague to them they hardly bother with them but a mind with magic in it shines out you see its a beacon to them its not darkness that calls them its light light that creates the shadows but but why are they interested what do they wwant life and shape said granny she sagged and let go of esk theyre pathetic really she said theyve got no life or shape themselves but what they can steal they could no more survive in this world than a fish could live in a fire but that doesnt stop them trying and theyre just bright enough to hate us because were alive esk shivered she remember the gritty feel of the cold sand what are they i always thought they were just a sort a sort of demon nah no one really knows theyre just the things from the dungeon dimensions outside the universe thats all shadow creatures she turned back to the prone form of simon you wouldnt have any idea where he is would you she said looking shrewdly at esk not gone off flying with the seagulls has he esk shook her head no said granny i didnt think so theyve got him havent they it wasnt a question esk nodded her face a mask of misery its not your fault said granny his mind gave them an opening and when he was knocked out they took it back with them only she drummed her fingers on the edge of the bed and appeared to reach a decision whos the most important wizard around here she demanded um lord cutangle said esk hes the archchancellor he was one of the ones who was in here the fat one or the one like a streak of vinegar esk dragged her mind from the image of simon on the cold desert and found herself saying hes an eighth level wizard and a mage actually you mean hes bent said granny all this hanging around wizards has made you take them seriously my girl they all call themselves the lord high this and the imperial that its all part of the game even magicians do it youd think theyd be more sensible at least but no they call around saying theyre the amazingbonkoanddoris anyway where is this high rumtiddlypo theyll be at dinner in the great hall said esk can he bring simon back then thats the difficult part said granny i daresay we could all get something back easily enough walking and talking just like anyone whether it would be simon is quite another sack of ferrets she stood up lets find this great hall then no time to waste um women arent allowed in said esk granny stopped in the doorway her shoulders rose she turned around very slowly what did you say she said did these old ears deceive me and dont say they did because they didnt sorry said esk force of habit i can see youve been getting ideas below your station said granny coldly go and find someone to watch over the lad and lets see whats so great about this hall that i mustnt set foot in it and thus it was that while the entire faculty of unseen university were dining in the venerable hall the doors were flung back with a dramatic effect that was rather spoiled when one of them rebounded off a waiter and caught granny a crack on the shin instead of the defiant strides she had intended to make across the chequered floor she was forced to halfhop halflimp but she hoped that she hopped with dignity esk hurried along behind her acutely aware of the hundreds of eyes that were turned towards them the roar of conversation and the clatter of cutlery faded away a couple of chairs were knocked over at the far end of the hall she could see the most senior wizards at their high table which in fact bobbed a few feet off the floor they were staring a mediumgrade wizard esk recognised him as a lecturer in applied astrology rushed towards them waving his hands nononono he shouted wrong door you must go away dont mind me said granny calmly pushing past him nonono its against the lore you must go away now ladies are not allowed in here im not a lady im a witch said granny she turned to esk is he very important i dont think so said esk right granny turned to the lecturer go and find me an important wizard please quickly esk tapped her on the back a couple of wizards with a rather greater presence of mind had nipped smartly out of the door behind them and now several college porters were advancing threateningly up the hall to the cheers and catcalls of the students esk had never much liked the porters who lived a private life in their lodge but now she felt a pang of sympathy for them two of them reached out hairy hands and grabbed grannys shoulders her arm disappeared behind her back and there was a brief flurry of movement that ended with the men hopping away clutching bits of themselves and swearing hatpin said granny she grabbed esk with her free hand and swept towards the high table glaring at anyone who so much as looked as if they were going to get in her way the younger students who knew free entertainment when they saw it stamped and cheered and banged their plates on the long tables the high table settled on the tiles with a thump and the senior wizards hurriedly lined up behind cutangle as he tried to summon up his reserves of dignity his efforts didnt really work it is very hard to look dignified with a napkin tucked into ones collar he raised his hands for silence and the hall waited expectantly as granny and esk approached him granny was looking interestedly at the ancient paintings and statues of bygone mages who are them buggers she said out of the corner of her mouth they used to be chief wizards whispered esk they look constipated i never met a wizard who was regular said granny theyre a nuisance to dust thats all i know said esk cutangle stood with legs planted wide apart arms akimbo and stomach giving an impression of a beginners ski slope the whole of him therefore adopting a pose usually associated with henry viii but with an option on henry ix and x as well well he said what is the meaning of this outrage is he important said granny to esk i madam am the archchancellor and i happen to run this university and you madam are trespassing in very dangerous territory indeed i warn you that stop looking at me like that cutangle staggered backwards his hands raised to ward off grannys gaze the wizards behind him scattered turning over tables in their haste to avoid the stare grannys eyes had changed esk had never seen them like this before they were perfectly silver like little round mirrors reflecting all they saw cutangle was a vanishingly small dot in their depths his mouth open his tiny matchstick arms waving in desperation the archchancellor backed into a pillar and the shock made him recover he shook his head irritably cupped a hand and sent a stream of white fire streaking towards the witch without dropping her iridescent stare granny raised a hand and deflected the flames towards the roof there was an explosion and a shower of tile fragments her eyes widened cutangle vanished where he had been standing a huge snake coiled poised to strike granny vanished where she had been standing was a large wicker basket the snake became a giant reptile from the mists of time the basket became the snow wind of the ice giants coating the struggling monster with ice the reptile became a sabretoothed tiger crouched to spring the gale became a bubbling tar pit the tiger managed to become an eagle stooping the tar pits became a tufted hood then the images began to flicker as shape replaced shape stroboscope shadows danced around the hall a magical wind sprang up thick and greasy striking octarine sparks from beards and fingers in the middle of it all esk peering through streaming eyes could just make out the two figures of granny and cutangle glossy statues in the midst of the hurtling images she was also aware of something else a highpitched sound almost beyond hearing she had heard it before on the cold plain a busy chittering noise a beehive noise an anthill sound theyre coming she screamed about the din theyre coming now she scrambled out from behind the table where she had taken refuge from the magical duel and tried to reach granny a gust of raw magic lifted her off her feet and bowled her into a chair the buzzing was louder now so that the air roared like a threeweek corpse on a summers day esk made another attempt to reach granny and recoiled when green fire roared along her arm and singed her hair she looked around wildly for the other wizards but those who had fled from the effects of the magic were cowering behind overturned furniture while the occult storm raged over their heads esk ran down the length of the hall and out into the dark corridor shadows curled around her as she hurried sobbing up the steps and along the buzzing corridors towards simons narrow room something would try to enter the body granny had said something that would walk and talk like simon but would be something else a cluster of students were hovering anxiously outside the door they turned pale faces towards esk as she darted towards them and were sufficiently shaken to draw back nervously in the face of her determined progress somethings in there said one of them we cant open the door they looked at her expectantly then one of them said you wouldnt have a pass key by any chance esk grabbed the doorhandle and turned it it moved slightly but then spun back with such force it nearly took the skin off her hands the chittering inside rose to a crescendo and there was another noise too like leather flapping youre wizards she screamed bloody well wizz we havent done telekinesis yet said one of them i was ill when we did firethrowing actually im not very good at dematerialisation esk went to the door and then stopped with one foot in the air she remembered granny talking about how even buildings had a mind if they were old enough the university was very old she stepped carefully to one side and ran her hands over the ancient stones it had to be done carefully so as not to frighten it and now she could feel the mind in the stones slow and simple but still mind it pulsed around her she could feel the little sparkles deep in the rock something was hooting behind the door the three students watched in astonishment as esk stood rock still with her hands and forehead pressed against the wall she was almost there she could feel the weight of herself the ponderousness of her body the distant memories of the dawn of time when rock was molten and free for the first time in her life she knew what it was like to have balconies she moved gently through the buildingmind refining her impressions looking as fast as she dared for this corridor this door she stretched out one arm very carefully the students watched as she uncurled one finger very slowly the door hinges began to creak there was a moment of tension and then the nails sprang from the hinges and clattered into the wall behind her the planks began to bend as the door still tried to force itself open against the strength of whatever was holding it shut the wood billowed beams of blue light lanced out into the corridor moving and dancing as indistinct shapes shuffled through the blinding brilliance inside the room the light was misty and actinic the sort of light to make steven spielberg reach for his copyright lawyer esks hair leapt from her head so that she looked like an ambulant dandelion little firesnakes of magic crackled across her skin as she stepped through the doorway the students outside watched in horror as she disappeared into the light it vanished in a silent explosion when they eventually found enough courage to look inside the room they saw nothing there but the sleeping body of simon and esk silent and cold on the floor breathing very slowly and the floor was covered with a fine layer of silver sand esk floated through the mists of the world noticing with a curious impersonal feeling the precise way in which she passed through solid matter there were others with her she could hear their chittering fury rose like bile she turned and set out after the noise fighting the seductive forces that kept telling her how nice it would be just to relax her grip on her mind and sink into a warm sea of nothingness being angry that was the thing she knew it was most important to stay really angry the discworld fell away and lay below her as it did on the day she had been an eagle but this time the circle sea was below her it certainly was circular as if god had run out of ideas and beyond it lay the arms of the continent and the long chain of the ramtops marching all the way to the hub there were other continents she had never heard of and tiny island chains as her point of view changed the rim came into sight it was night time and since the discs orbiting sun was below the world it lit up the long waterfall that girdled the edge it also lit up great atuin the world turtle esk had often wondered if the turtle was really a myth it seemed a lot of trouble to go to just to move a world but there it was almost as big as the disc it carried frosted with stardust and pocked with meteor craters its head passed in front of her and she looked directly into an eye big enough to float all the fleets in the world she had heard it said that if you could look far enough into the direction that great atuin was staring you would see the end of the universe maybe it was just the set of its beak but great atuin looked vaguely hopeful even optimistic perhaps the end of everything wasnt as bad as all that dreamlike she reached out and tried to borrow the biggest mind in the universe she stopped herself just in time like a child with a toy toboggan who expected a little gentle slope and suddenly looks out of the magnificent mountains snowcovered stretching into the icefields of infinity no one would ever borrow that mind it would be like trying to drink all the sea the thoughts that moved through it were as big and as slow as glaciers beyond the disc were the stars and there was something wrong with them they were swirling like snowflakes every now and again they would settle down and look as immobile as they always did and then theyd suddenly take it into their heads to dance real stars shouldnt do that esk decided which meant she wasnt looking at real stars which meant she wasnt exactly in a real place but a chittering close at hand reminded her that she could almost certainly really die if she once lost track of those noises she turned and pursued the sounds through the stellar snowstorm and the stars jumped and settled jumped and settled as she swooped upward esk tried to concentrate on everyday things because if she let her mind dwell on precisely what it was she was following then she knew she would turn back and she wasnt sure she knew the way she tried to remember the eighteen herbs that cured earache which kept her occupied for a while because she could never recall the last four a star swooped past and then was violently jerked away it was about twenty feet across when she ran out of herbs she started on the diseases of goats which took quite a long time because goats can catch a lot of things that cows can catch plus a lot of things plus that sheep plus catch plus a complete range of horrible ailments of their very own when she had finished listing wooden udder ear wilt and the octarine garget she tried to recall the complex code of dots and lines that they used to cut in the trees around bad ass so that lost villagers could find their way home on snowy nights she was only as far as dot dot dot dash dot dash when the universe around her vanished with a faint pop she fell forward hit something hard and gritty and rolled to a halt the grittiness was sand fine dry cold sand you could tell that even if you dug down several feet it would be just as cold and just as dry esk lay with her face in it for a moment summoning the courage to look up she could just see a few feet away from her the hem of someones dress somethings dress she corrected herself unless it was a wing it could be a wing a particularly tatty and leathery one her eyes followed it up until she found a face higher than a house outlined against the starry sky its owner was obviously trying to look nightmarish but had tried too hard the basic appearance was that of a chicken that had been dead for about two months but the unpleasant effect was rather spoiled by warthog tusks moth antennae wolf ears and a unicorn spike the whole thing had a selfassembled look as if the owner had heard about anatomy but couldnt quite get to grips with the idea it was staring but not at her something behind her occupied all its interest esk turned her head very slowly simon was sitting crosslegged in the centre of a circle of things there were hundreds of them as still and silent as statues watching him with reptilian patience there was something small and angular held in his cupped hands it gave off a fuzzy blue light that made his face look strange other shapes lay on the ground beside him each in its little soft glow they were the regular sort of shapes that granny dismissed airily as jommetrycubes manysided diamonds cones even a globe each one was transparent and inside was esk edged closer no one was taking any notice of her inside a crystal sphere that had been tossed aside on to the sand floated a bluegreen ball crisscrossed with tiny white cloud patterns and what could almost have been continents if anyone was silly enough to try to live on a ball it might have been a sort of model except something about its glow told esk that it was quite real and probably very big and not in every sense totally inside the sphere she put it down very gently and sidled over to a tensided block in which floated a much more acceptable world it was properly discshaped but instead of the rimfall there was a wall of ice and instead of the hub there was a gigantic tree so big that its roots merged into mountain ranges a prism beside it held another slowlyturning disc surrounded by little stars but there were no ice walls around this one just a redgold thread that turned out on closer inspection to be a snake a snake big enough to encircle a world for reasons best known to itself it was biting its own tail esk turned the prism over and over curiously noticing how the little disc inside stayed resolutely upright simon giggled softly esk replaced the snakedisc and peered carefully over his shoulder he was holding a small glass pyramid there were stars in it and occasionally he would give it a little shake so that the stars swirled up like snow in the wind and then settled back in their places then he would giggle and beyond the stars it was the discworld a great atuin no bigger than a small saucer toiled along under a world that looked like the work of an obsessive jeweller jiggle swirl jiggle swirl giggle there were already hairline cracks in the glass esk looked at simons blank eyes and then up into the hungry faces of the nearest things and then she reached across and pulled the pyramid out of his hands and turned and ran the things didnt stir as she scurried towards them bent almost double with the pyramid clasped tightly to her chest but suddenly her feet were no longer running over the sand and she was being lifted into the frigid air and a thing with a face like a drowned rabbit turned slowly towards her and extended a talon youre not really here esk told herself its only a sort of dream what granny calls an annaloggy you cant really be hurt its all imagination theres absolutely no harm that can come to you its all really inside your mind i wonder if it knows that the talon picked her out of the air and the rabbit face split like a banana skin there was no mouth just a dark hole as if the thing was itself an opening to an even worse dimension a place by comparison with which freezing sand and moonless moonlight would be a jolly afternoon at the seaside esk held the discpyramid and flailed with her free hand at the claw around her it had no effect the darkness loomed over her a gateway to total oblivion she kicked it as hard as she could which was not given the circumstances very hard but where her foot struck there was an explosion of white sparks and a pop which would have been a much more satisfying bang if the thin air here didnt suck the sound away the thing screeched like a chainsaw encountering deep inside an unsuspecting sapling a lurking and longforgotten nail the others around it set up a sympathetic buzzing esk kicked again and the thing shrieked and dropped her to the sand she was bright enough to roll with the tiny world hugged protectively to her because even in a dream a broken ankle can be painful the thing lurched uncertainly above her esks eyes narrowed she put the world down very carefully hit the thing very hard around the point where its shins would be if there were shins under that cloak and picked up the world again in one neat movement the creature howled bent double and then toppled slowly like a sackful of coathangers when it hit the ground it collapsed into a mass of disjointed limbs the head rolled away and rocked to a standstill is that all thought esk they can hardly walk even when you hit them they just fall over the nearest things chittered and tried to back away as she marched determinedly towards them but since their bodies seemed to be held together more or less by wishful thinking they werent very good at it she hit one which had a face like a small family of squid and it deflated into a pile of twitching bones and bits of fur and odd ends of tentacle very much like a greek meal another was slightly more successful and had begun to shamble uncertainly away before esk caught it a crack on one of its five shins it flailed desperately as it fell and brought down another two by then the others had managed to lurch out of her way and stood watching from a distance esk took a few steps towards the nearest one it tried to move away and fell over they may have been ugly they may have been evil but when it came to poetry in motion the things had all the grace and coordination of a deckchair esk glared at them and took a look at the disc in its glass pyramid all the excitement didnt seem to have disturbed it a bit shed been able to get out if this indeed was out and if the disc could be said to be in but how was one supposed to get back somebody laughed it was the sort of laugh basically it was pchzarnichiwkov this epiglottisthrottling word is seldom used on the disc except by highlypaid stunt linguists and of course the tiny tribe of the kturni who invented it it has no direct synonym although the cumhoolie word squemt begins to approach it in general depth of feeling the closest translation is as follows the nasty little sound of a sword being unsheathed right behind one at just the point when one thought one had disposed of ones enemies although ktumi speakers say that this does not convey the cold sweating heartstopping gutfreezing sense of the original it was that kind of laugh esk turned around slowly simon drifted towards her across the sand with his hands cupped in front of him his eyes were tight shut did you really think it would be as easy as that he said or something said it didnt sound like simons voice but like dozens of voices speakingat once simon she said uncertainly he is of no further use to us said the thing with simons shape he has shown us the way child now give us our property esk backed away i dont think it belongs to you she said whoever you are the face in front of her opened its eyes there was nothing there but blackness not a colour just holes into some other space we could say that if you gave it to us we would be merciful we could say we would let you go from here in your own shape but there wouldnt really be much point in us saying that would there i wouldnt believe you said esk well then the simonthing grinned youre only putting off the inevitable it said suits me we could take it anyway take it then but i dont think you can you cant take anything unless its given to you can you they circled round youll give it to us said the simonthing some of the other things were approaching now striding back across the desert with horrible jerky motions youll get tired it continued we can wait were very good at waiting it made a feint to the left but esk swung around to face it that doesnt matter she said im only dreaming this and you cant get hurt in dreams the thing paused and looked at her with its empty eyes have you got a word in your world i think its called psychosomatic never heard of it snapped esk it means you can get hurt in your dreams and what is so interesting is that if you die in your dreams you stay here that would be niiiiice esk glanced sideways at the distant mountains sprawled on the chilly horizon like melted mud pies there were no trees not even any rocks just sand and cold stars and she felt the movement rather than heard it and turned with the pyramid held between her hands like a club it hit the simonthing in midleap with a satisfying thump but as soon as it hit the ground it somersaulted forward and bounced upright with unpleasant ease but it had heard her gasp and had seen the brief pain in her eyes it paused ah that hurt you did it not you dont like to see another one suffer yes not this one it seems it turned and beckoned and two of the tall things lurched over to it and gripped it firmly by the arms its eyes changed the darkness faded and then simons own eyes looked out of his face he stared up at the things on either side of him and struggled briefly but one had several pairs of tentacles wrapped around his wrist and the other was holding his arm in the worlds largest lobster claw then he saw esk and his eyes fell to the little glass pyramid run away he hissed take it away from here dont let them get it he grimaced as the claw tightened on his arm is this a trick said esk who are you really dont you recognise me he said wretchedly what are you doing in my dream if this is a dream then id like to wake up please said esk listen you must run away now do you understand dont stand there with your mouth open give it to us said a cold voice inside esks head esk looked down at the glass pyramid with its unconcerned little world and stared up at simon her mouth an o of puzzlement but what is it look hard at it esk peered through the glass if she squinted it seemed that the little disc was granular as if it was made up of millions of tiny specks if she looked hard at the specks its just numbers she said the whole world its all made up of numbers its not the world its an idea of the world said simon i created it for them they cant get through to us do you see but ideas have got a shape here ideas are real give it to us but ideas cant hurt anyone i turned things into numbers to understand them but they just want to control simon said bitterly they burrowed into my numbers like he screamed give it to us or we will take him to bits esk looked up at the nearest nightmare face how do i know i can trust you she said you cant trust us but you have no choice esk looked at the ring of faces that not even a necrophile could love faces put together from a fishmongers midden faces picked randomly from things that lurked in deep ocean holes and haunted caves faces that were not human enough to gloat or leer but had all the menace of a suspiciously vshaped ripple near an incautious bather she couldnt trust them but she had no choice something else was happening in a place as far away as the thickness of a shadow the student wizards had run back to the great hall where cutangle and granny weatherwax were still locked in the magical equivalent of indian arm wrestling the flagstones under granny were halfmelted and cracked and the table behind cutangle had taken root and already bore a rich crop of acorns one of the students had earned several awards for bravery by daring to tug at cutangles cloak and now they were crowded into the narrow room looking at the two bodies cutangle summoned doctors of the body and doctors of the mind and the room buzzed with magic as they got to work granny tapped him on the shoulder a word in your ear young man she said hardly young madam sighed cutangle hardly young he felt drained it had been decades since hed duelled in magic although it was common enough among students he had a nasty feeling that granny would have won eventually fighting her was like swatting a fly on your own nose he couldnt think what had come over him to try it granny led him out into the passage and around the corner to a windowseat she sat down leaning her broomstick against the wall rain drummed heavily on the roofs outside and a few zigzags of lightning indicated a storm of ramtop proportions approaching the city that was quite an impressive display she said you nearly won once or twice there oh said cutangle brightening up do you really think so granny nodded cutangle patted at various bits of his robe until he located a tarry bag of tobacco and a roll of paper his hands shook as he fumbled a few shreds of secondhand pipeweed into a skinny homemade he ran the wretched thing across his tongue and barely moistened it then a dim remembrance of propriety welled up in the back of his mind um he said do you mind if i smoke granny shrugged cutangle struck a match on the wall and tried desperately to navigate the flame and the cigarette into approximately the same position granny gently took the match from his trembling hand and lit it for him cutangle sucked on the tobacco had a ritual cough and settled back the glowing end of the rollup the only light in the dim corridor theyve gone wandering said granny at last i know said cutangle your wizards wont be able to get them back i know that too they might get something back though i wish you hadnt said that there was a pause while they contemplated what might come back inhabiting living bodies acting almost like the original inhabitants its probably my fault they said in unison and stopped in astonishment you first madam said cutangle them cigaretty things asked granny are they good for the nerves cutangle opened his mouth to point out very courteously that tobacco was a habit reserved for wizards but thought better of it he extended the tobacco pouch towards granny she told him about esks birth and the coming of the old wizard and the staff and esks forays into magic by the time she had finished she had succeeded in rolling a tight thin cylinder that burned with a small blue flame and made her eyes water i dont know that shaky nerves wouldnt be better she wheezed cutangle wasnt listening this is quite astonishing he said you say the child didnt suffer in any way not that i noticed said granny the staff seemed well on her side if you know what i mean and where is this staff now she said she threw it in the river the old wizard and the elderly witch stared at each other their faces illuminated by a flare of lightning outside cutangle shook his head the rivers flooding he said its a milliontoone chance granny smiled grimly it was the sort of smile that wolves ran away from granny grasped her broomstick purposefully milliontoone chances she said crop up nine times out of ten there are storms that are frankly theatrical all sheet lightning and metallic thunder rolls there are storms that are tropical and sultry and incline to hot winds and fireballs but this was a storm of the circle sea plains and its main ambition was to hit the ground with as much rain as possible it was the kind of storm that suggests that the whole sky has swallowed a diuretic the thunder and lightning hung around in the background supplying a sort of chorus but the rain was the star of the show it tapdanced across the land the grounds of the university stretched right down to the river by day they were a neat formal pattern of gravel paths and hedges but in the middle of a wet wild night the hedges seemed to have moved and the paths had simply gone off somewhere to stay dry a weak wyrdlight shone inefficiently among the dripping leaves but most of the rain found its way through anyway can you use one of them wizard fireballs have a heart madam are you sure she would have come this way theres a sort of jetty thing down here somewhere unless im lost there was the sound of a heavy body blundering wetly into a bush and then a splash ive found the river anyway granny weatherwax peered through the soaking darkness she could hear a roaring and could dimly make out the white crests of floodwater there was also the distinctive river smell of the ankh which suggested that several armies had used it first as a urinal and then as a sepulchre cutangle splashed dejectedly towards her this is foolishness he said meaning no offence madam but itll be out to sea on this flood and ill die of cold you cant get any wetter than you are now anyway you walk wrong for rain i beg your pardon you go all hunched up you fight it thats not the way you shouldwell move between the drops and indeed granny seemed to be merely damp ill bear that in mind come on madam its me for a roaring fire and a glass of something hot and wicked granny sighed i dont know somehow i expected to see it sticking out of the mud or something not just all this water cutangle patted her gently on the shoulder there may be something else we can do he began and was interrupted by a zip of lightning and another roll of thunder i said maybe theres something he began again what was that i saw demanded granny what was what said cutangle bewildered give me some light the wizard sighed wetly and extended a hand a bolt of golden fire shot out across the foaming water and hissed into oblivion there said granny triumphantly its just a boat said cutangle the boys use them in the summer he waded after grannys determined figure as fast as he could you cant be thinking of taking it out on a night like this he said its madness granny slithered along the wet planking of the jetty which was already nearly under water you dont know anything about boats cutangle protested i shall have to learn quickly then replied granny calmly but i havent been in a boat since i was a boy i wasnt actually asking you to come does the pointy bit go in front cutangle moaned this is all very creditable he said but perhaps we can wait till morning a flash of lightning illuminated grannys face perhaps not cutangle conceded he lumbered along the jetty and pulled the little rowing boat towards him getting in was a matter of luck but he managed it eventually fumbling with the painter in the darkness the boat swung out into the flood and was carried away spinning slowly granny clung to the seat as it rocked in the turbulent waters and looked expectantly at cutangle through the murk well she said well what said cutangle you said you knew all about boats no i said you didnt oh they hung on as the boat wallowed heavily miraculously righted itself and was carried backwards downstream when you said you hadnt been in a boat since you were a boy granny began i was two years old i think the boat caught on a whirlpool spun around and shot off across the flow i had you down as the sort of boy who was in and out of boats all day long i was born up in the mountains i get seasick on damp grass if you must know said cutangle the boat banged heavily against a submerged tree trunk and a wavelet lapped the prow i know a spell against drowning he added miserably im glad about that only you have to say it while youre standing on dry land fake your boots off granny commanded what take your boots off man cutangle shifted uneasily on his bench what have you in mind he said the water is supposed to be outside the boat i know that much granny pointed to the dark tide sloshing around the bilges fill your boots with water and tip it over the side cutangle nodded he felt that the last couple of hours had somehow carried him along without him actually touching the sides and for a moment he nursed the strangely consoling feeling that his life was totally beyond his control and whatever happened no one could blame him filling his boots with water while adrift on a flooded river at midnight with what he could only describe as a woman seemed about as logical as anything could be in the circumstances a fine figure of a woman said a neglected voice at the back of his mind there was something about the way she used the tattered broomstick to scull the boat across the choppy water that troubled longforgotten bits of cutangles subconscious not that he could be certain about the fine figure of course what with the rain and the wind and grannys habit of wearing her entire wardrobe in one go cutangle cleared his throat uncertainly metaphorically a fine figure he decided um look he said this is all very creditable but consider the facts i mean the rate of drift and so forth you see it could be miles out on the ocean by now it might never come to shore again it might even go over the rimfall granny who had been staring out across the water turned around cant you think of anything else at all helpful that we could be doing she demanded cutangle baled for a few moments no he said have you ever heard of anyone coming back no then its worth a try isnt it i never liked the ocean said cutangle it ought to be paved over theres dreadful things in it down in the deep bits ghastly sea monsters or so they say keep baling my lad or youll be able to see if theyre right the storm rolled backwards and forwards overhead it was lost here on the flat river plains it belonged in the high ramtops where they knew how to appreciate a good storm it grumbled around looking for even a moderately high hill to throw lightning at the rain settled down to the gentle patter of rain that is quite capable of keeping it up for days a sea fog also rolled in to assist it if we had some oars we could row if we knew where we were going said cutangle granny didnt answer he heaved a few more bootfuls of water over the side and it occurred to him that the gold braiding on his robe would probably never be the same again it would be nice to think it might matter one day i dont suppose you do know which way the hub is by any chance he ventured just making conversation look for the mossy side of trees said granny without turning her head ali said cutangle and nodded he peered down gloomily at the oily waters and wondered which particular oily waters they were judging by the salty smell they were out in the bay now what really terrified him about the sea was that the only thing between him and the horrible things that lived at the bottom of it was water of course he knew that logically the only thing that separated him from say the maneating tigers in the jungles of klatch was mere distance but that wasnt the same thing at all tigers didnt rise up out of the chilly depths mouths full of needle teeth he shivered cant you feel it asked granny you can taste it in the air magic its leaking out from something its not actually water soluble said cutangle he smacked his lips once or twice there was indeed a tinny taste to the fog he had to admit and a faint greasiness to the air youre a wizard said granny severely cant you call it up or something the question has never arisen said cutangle wizards never throw their staffs away its around here somewhere snapped granny help me look for it man cutangle groaned it had been a busy night and before he tried any more magic he really needed twelve hours sleep several good meals and a quiet afternoon in front of a big fire he was getting too old that was the trouble but he closed his eyes and concentrated there was magic around all right there are some places where magic naturally accumulates it builds up around deposits of the transmundane metal octiron in the wood of certain trees in isolated lakes it sleets through the world and those skilled in such things can catch it and store it there was a store of magic in the area its potent he said very potent he raised his hands to his temples its getting bloody cold said granny the insistent rain had turned to snow there was a sudden change in the world the boat stopped not with a jar but as if the sea had suddenly decided to become solid granny looked over the side the sea had become solid the sound of the waves was coming from a long way away and getting further away all the time she leaned over the side of the boat and tapped on the water ice she said the boat was motionless in an ocean of ice it creaked ominously cutangle nodded slowly it makes sense he said if they are where we think they are then its very cold as cold as the night between the stars it is said so the staff feels it too right said granny and stepped out of the boat all we have to do is find the middle of the ice and theres the staff right i knew you were going to say that can i at least put my boots on they wandered across the frozen waves with cutangle stopping occasionally to try and sense the exact location of the staff his robes were freezing on him his teeth chattered arent you cold he said to granny whose dress fairly crackled as she walked im cold she conceded i just aint shivering we used to have winters like this when i was a lad said cutangle blowing on his fingers it doesnt snow in ankh hardly really said granny peering ahead through the freezing fog there was snow on the tops of the mountains all year round i recall oh you dont get temperatures like you did when i was a boy at least until now he added stamping his feet on the ice it creaked menacingly reminding him that it was all that lay between him and the bottom of the sea he stamped again as softly as possible what mountains were these asked granny oh the ramtops up towards the hub in fact place called brass neck grannys lips moved cutangle cutangle she said softly any relation to old acktur cutangle used to live in a big old house under leaping mountain had a lot of sons my father how on disc dyou know that i was raised up there said granny resisting the temptation merely to smile knowingly next valley bad ass i remember your mother nice woman kept brown and white chickens i used to go up there to buy eggs for me mam that was before i was called to witching of course i dont remember you said cutangle of course it was a long time ago there was always a lot of children around our house he sighed i suppose its possible i pulled your hair once it was the sort of thing i used to do maybe i remember a fat little boy rather unpleasant that might have been me i seem to recall a rather bossy girl but it was a long time ago a long time ago i didnt have white hair in those days said granny everything was a different colour in those days thats true it didnt rain so much in the summer time the sunsets were redder there were more old people the world was full of them said the wizard yes i know and now its full of young people funny really i mean youd expect it to be the other way round they even had a better kind of air it was easier to breathe said cutangle they stamped on through the swirling snow considering the curious ways of time and nature ever been home again said granny cutangle shrugged when my father died its odd ive never said this to anyone butwell there were my brothers because i am an eighth son of course and they had children and even grandchildren and not one of them can hardly write his name i could have bought the whole village and they treated me like a king but i mean ive been to places and seen things that would curdle their minds ive faced down creatures wilder than their nightmares i know secrets that are known to a very few you felt left out said granny theres nothing strange in that it happens to all of us it was our choice wizards should never go home said cutangle i dont think they can go home agreed granny you cant cross the same river twice i always say cutangle gave this some thought i think youre wrong there he said i must have crossed the same river oh thousands of times ah but it wasnt the same river it wasnt no cutangle shrugged it looked like the same bloody river no need to take that tone said granny i dont see why i should listen to that sort of language from a wizard who cant even answer letters cutangle was silent for a moment except for the castanet chatter of his teeth oh he said oh i see they were from you were they thats right i signed them on the bottom its supposed to be a sort of clue isnt it all right all right i just thought they were a joke thats all said cutangle sullenly a joke we dont get many applications from women we dont get any i wondered why i didnt get a reply said granny i threw them away if you must know you could at least have there it is where where oh there the fog parted and they now saw it clearly a fountain of snowflakes a ornamental pillar of frozen air and below it the staff wasnt locked in ice but lay peacefully in a seething pool of water one of the unusual aspects of a magical universe is the existence of opposites it has already been remarked that darkness isnt the opposite of light it is simply the absence of light in the same way absolute zero is merely the absence of heat if you want to know what real cold is the cold so intense that water cant even freeze but antiboils look no further than this pool they looked in silence for some seconds their bickering forgotten then cutangle said slowly if you stick your hand in that your fingersll snap like carrots do you think you can lift it out by magic said granny cutangle started to pat his pockets and eventually produced his rollup bag with expert fingers he shredded the remains of a few dogends into a fresh paper and licked it into shape without taking his eyes off the staff no he said but ill try anyway he looked longingly at the cigarette and then poked it behind his ear he extended his hands fingers splayed and his lips moved soundlessly as he mumbled a few words of power the staff spun in its pool and then rose gently away from the ice where it immediately became the centre of a cocoon of frozen air cutangle groaned with the effort direct levitation is the hardest of the practical magics because of the everpresent danger of the wellknown principles of action and reaction which means that a wizard attempting to lift a heavy item by mind power alone faces the prospect of ending up with his brains in his boots can you stand it upright said granny with great delicacy the staff turned slowly in the air until it hung in front of granny a few inches above the ice frost glittered on its carvings but it seemed to cutangle through the red haze of migraine that hovered in front of his eyes to be watching him resentfully granny adjusted her hat and straightened up purposefully right she said cutangle swayed the tone of voice cut through him like a diamond saw he could dimly remember being scolded by his mother when he was small well this was that voice only refined and concentrated and edged with little bits of carborundum a tone of command that would have a corpse standing to attention and could probably have marched it halfway across its cemetery before it remembered it was dead granny stood in front of the hovering staff almost melting its icy covering by the sheer anger in her gaze this is your idea of proper behaviour is it lying around on the sea while people die oh very well done she stomped around in a semicircle to cutangles bewilderment the staff turned to follow her so you were thrown away snapped granny so what shes hardly more than a child and children throw us all away sooner or later is this loyal service have you no shame lying around sulking when you could be of some use at last she leaned forward her hooked nose a few inches from the staff cutangle was almost certain that the staff tried to lean backwards out of her way shall i tell you what happens to wicked staffs she hissed if esk is lost to the world shall i tell you what i will do to you you were saved from the fire once because you could pass on the hurt to her next time it wont be the fire her voice sank to a whiplash whisper first itll be the spokeshave and then the sandpaper and the auger and the whittling knife i say steady on said cutangle his eyes watering and whats left ill stake out in the woods for the fungus and the woodlice and the beetles it could take years the carvings writhed most of them had moved around the back out of grannys gaze now she said ill tell you what im going to do im going to pick you up and we are all going back to the university arent we otherwise its blunt saw time she rolled up her sleeves and extended a hand wizard she said i shall want you to release it cutangle nodded miserably when i say now now now cutangle opened his eyes again granny was standing with her left arm extended full length in front of her her hand clamped around the staff the ice was exploding off it in gouts of steam right finished granny and if this happens again i shall be very angry do i make myself clear cutangle lowered his hands and hurried towards her are you hurt she shook her head its like holding a hot icicle she said come on we havent got time to stand around chatting how are we going to get back oh show some backbone man for goodness sake well fly granny waved her broomstick the archchancellor looked at it doubtfully on that of course dont wizards fly on their staffs its rather undignified if i can put up with that so can you yes but is it safe granny gave him a withering look do you mean in the absolute sense she asked or say compared with staying behind on a melting ice floe this is the first time i have ever ridden on a broomstick said cutangle really i thought you just had to get on them and they flew said the wizard i didnt know you had to do all that running up and down and shouting at them its a knack said granny i thought they went faster cutangle continued and to be frank higher what do you mean higher asked granny trying to compensate for the wizards weight on the pillion as they turned back upriver like pillion passengers since the dawn of time he persisted in leaning the wrong way well more sort of above the trees said cutangle ducking as a dripping branch swept his hat away theres nothing wrong with this broomstick that you losing a few stone wouldnt cure snapped granny or would you rather get off and walk apart from the fact that half the time my feet are touching the ground anyway said cutangle i wouldnt want to embarrass you if someone had asked me to list all the perils of flying you know it would never have occurred to me to include having ones legs whipped to death by tall bracken are you smoking said granny staring grimly ahead somethings burning it was just to calm my nerves what with all this headlong plunging through the air madam well put it out this minute and hold on the broomstick lurched upwards and increased its speed to that of a geriatric jogger mr wizard hallo when i said hold on yes i didnt mean there there was a pause oh yes i see im terribly sorry thats all right my memory isnt what it was i assure you no offence meant none taken they flew in silence for a moment nevertheless said granny thoughtfully i think that on the whole i would prefer you to move your hands rain gushed across the leads of unseen university and poured into the gutters where ravens nests abandoned since the summer floated like very badlybuilt boats the water gurgled along ancient crusted pipes it found its way under tiles and said hallo to the spiders under the eaves it leapt from gables and formed secret lakes high amongst the spires whole ecologies lived in the endless rooftops of the university which by comparison made gormenghast look like a toolshed on a railway allotment birds sang in tiny jungles grown from apple pips and weed seeds little frogs swam in the upper gutters and a colony of ants were busily inventing an interesting and complex civilisation one thing the water couldnt do was gurgle out of the ornamental gargoyles ranged around the roofs this was because the gargoyles wandered off and sheltered in the attics at the first sign of rain they held that just because you were ugly it didnt mean you were stupid it rained streams it rained rivers it rained seas but mainly it rained through the roof of the great hall where the duel between granny and cutangle had left a very large hole and treatle felt that it was somehow raining on him personally he stood on a table organising the teams of students who were taking down the paintings and ancient tapestries before they got soaked it had to be a table because the floor was already several inches deep in water not rainwater unfortunately this was water with real personality the kind of distinctive character water gets after a long journey through silty countryside it had the thick texture of authentic ankh water too stiff to drink too runny to plough the river had burst its banks and a million little watercourses were flowing backwards bursting in through the cellars and playing peekaboo under the flagstones there was the occasional distant boom as some forgotten magic in a drowned dungeon shorted out and surrendered up its power treatle wasnt at all keen on some of the unpleasant bubblings and hissings that were escaping to the surface he thought again how nice it would be to be the sort of wizard who lived in a little cave somewhere and collected herbs and thought significant thoughts and knew what the owls were saying but probably the cave would be damp and the herbs would be poisonous and treatle could never be sure when all was said and done exactly what thoughts were really significant he got down awkwardly and paddled through the dark swirling waters well he had done his best hed tried to organise the senior wizards into repairing the roof by magic but there was a general argument over the spells that could be used and a consensus that this was in any case work for artisans thats wizards for you he thought gloomily as he waded between the dripping arches always probing the infinite but never noticing the definite especially in the matter of household chores we never had this trouble before that woman came he squelched up the steps lit by a particularly impressive flash of lightning he had a cold certainty that while of course no one could possibly blame him for all this everybody would he seized the hem of his robe and wrung it out wretchedly then he reached for his tobacco pouch it was a nice green waterproof one that meant that all the rain that had got into it couldnt get out again it was indescribable he found his little clip of papers they were fused into one lump like the legendary pound note found in the back pockets of trousers after they have been washed spun dried and ironed bugger he said with feeling i say treatle treatle looked around he had been the last to leave the hall where even now some of the benches were beginning to float whirlpools and patches of bubble marked the spots where magic was leaking from the cellars but there was no one to be seen unless of course one of the statues had spoken they had been too heavy to move and trestle remembered telling the students that a thorough wash would probably do them good he looked at their stern faces and regretted it the statues of very powerful dead mages were sometimes more lifelike than statues had any right to be maybe he should have kept his voice down yes he ventured acutely aware of the stony stares up here you fool he looked up the broomstick descended heavily through the rain in a series of swoops and jerks about five feet above the water it lost its few remaining aerial pretensions and flopped noisily into a whirlpool dont stand there idiot treatle peered nervously into the gloom ive got to stand somewhere he said i mean give us a hand snapped cutangle rising from the wavelets like a fat and angry venus the lady first of course he turned to granny who was fishing around in the water ive lost my hat she said cutangle sighed does that really matter at a time like this a witch has got to have a hat otherwise whos to know said granny she made a grab as something dark and sodden drifted by cackled triumphantly tipped out the water and rammed the hat on her head it had lost its stiffening and flopped rather rakishly over one eye right she said in a tone of voice that suggested the whole universe had just better watch out there was another brilliant flash of lightning which shows that even the weather gods have a welldeveloped sense of theatre it rather suits you said cutangle excuse me said trestle but isnt she the w never mind that said cutangle taking grannys hand and helping her up the steps he flourished the staff but its against the lore to allow w he stopped and stared as granny reached out and touched the damp wall by the door cutangle tapped him on the chest show me where its written down said cutangle theyre in the library granny interrupted it was the only dry place said treatle but this building is frightened of thunderstorms said granny it could do with comforting but the lore repeated treatle desperately granny was already striding down the passage with cutangle hopping along behind he turned you heard the lady he said treatle watched them go with his mouth hanging open when their footsteps had died away in the distance he stood silently for a moment thinking about life and where his could have gone wrong however he wasnt going to be accused of disobedience very carefully without knowing exactly why he reached out and gave the wall a friendly pat there there he said strangely enough he felt a lot better it occurred to cutangle that he ought to lead the way in his own premises but granny in a hurry was no match for a nearterminal nicotine addict and he kept up only by a sort of crabwise leaping its this way he said splashing through the puddles i know the building told me yes i was meaning to ask about that said cutangle because you see its never said anything to me and ive lived here for years have you ever listened to it not exactly listened no cutangle conceded not as such well then said granny edging past a waterfall where the kitchen steps used to be i think its up here and along the passage isnt it she swept past a trio of astonished wizards who were surprised by her and completely startled by her hat cutangle panted after her and caught her arm at the doors to the library look he said desperately no offence miss um mistress i think esmerelda will suffice now what with us having shared a broomstick and everything can i go in front it is my library he begged granny turned around her face a mask of surprise then she smiled of course im so sorry for the look of the thing you see said cutangle apologetically he pushed the door open the library was full of wizards who care about their books in the same way that ants care about their eggs and in time of difficulty carry them around in much the same way the water was getting in even here and turning up in rather odd places because of the librarys strange gravitational effects all the lower shelves had been cleared and relays of wizards and students were piling the volumes on every available table and dry shelf the air was full of the sound of angry rustling pages which almost drowned out the distant fury of the storm this was obviously upsetting the librarian who was scurrying from wizard to wizard tugging ineffectually at their robes and shouting ook he spotted cutangle and knuckled rapidly towards him granny had never seen an orangoutan before but wasnt about to admit it and remained quite calm in the face of a small potbellied man with extremely long arms and a size iz skin on a size body ook it explained ooook i expect so said cutangle shortly and grabbed the nearest wizard who was tottering under the weight of a dozen grimoires the man stared at him as if he was a ghost looked sideways at granny and dropped the books on the floor the librarian winced archchancellor gasped the wizard youre alive i mean we heard youd been spirited away by he looked at granny again i mean we thought treatle told us oook said the librarian shooing some pages back between their covers where are young simon and the girl what have you done with them granny demanded they we put them over here said the wizard backing away um show us said cutangle and stop stuttering man youd think youd never seen a woman before the wizard swallowed hard and nodded vigorously certainly and i mean please follow me um you werent going to say anything about the lore were you asked cutangle um no archchancellor good they followed hard on his troddendown heels as he scurried between the toiling wizards most of whom stopped working to stare as granny strode past this is getting embarrassing said cutangle out of the corner of his mouth i shall have to declare you an honorary wizard granny stared straight ahead and her lips hardly moved you do she hissed and i will declare you an honorary witch cutangles mouth snapped shut esk and simon were lying on a table in one of the side readingrooms with half a dozen wizards watching over them they drew back nervously as the trio approached with the librarian swinging along behind ive been thinking said cutangle surely it would be better to give the staff to simon he is a wizard and over my dead body said granny yours too theyre getting their power through him do you want to give them more cutangle sighed he had been admiring the staff it was one of the best he had seen very well youre right of course he leaned down and laid the staff on esks sleeping form and then stood back dramatically nothing happened one of the wizards coughed nervously nothing continued to happen the carvings on the staff appeared to be grinning its not working said cutangle is it ook give it time said granny they gave it time outside the storm strode around the sky trying to lift the lids off houses granny sat down on a pile of books and rubbed her eyes cutangles hands strayed towards his tobacco pocket the wizard with the nervous cough was helped out of the room by a colleague ook said the librarian i know said granny so that cutangles halfrolled homemade shot out of his nerveless fingers in a shower of tobacco what its not finished what she cant use the staff of course said granny standing up but you said she swept the floors with it and it protects her and cutangle began nonono said granny that means the staff uses itself or it uses her but shes never been able to use it dyou see cutangle stared at the two quiet bodies she should be able to use it its a proper wizards staff oh said granny so shes a proper wizard is she cutangle hesitated well of course not you cant ask us to declare her a wizard wheres the precedent the what asked granny sharply its never happened before lots of things have never happened before were only born once cutangle gave her a look of mute appeal but its against the i he began to say lore but the word mumbled into silence where does it say it said granny triumphantly where does it say women cant be wizards the following thoughts sped through cutangles mind it doesnt say it anywhere it says it everywhere but young simon seemed to say that everywhere is so much like nowhere that you cant really tell the difference do i want to be remembered as the first archchancellor to allow women into the university still id be remembered thats for sure she really is a rather impressive woman when she stands in that sort of way that staff has got ideas of its own theres a sort of sense to it i would be laughed at it might not work it might work she couldnt trust them but she had no choice esk stared at the terrible faces peering down at her and the lanky bodies mercifully cloaked her hands tingled in the shadowworld ideas are real the thought seemed to travel up her arms it was a buoyant sort of thought a thought full of fizz she laughed and moved her hands apart and the staff sparkled in her hands like solid electricity the things started to chitter nervously and one or two at the back started to lurch away simon fell forward as his captors hastily let go and he landed on his hands and knees in the sand use it he shouted thats it theyre frightened esk gave him a smile and continued to examine the staff for the first time she could see what the carvings actually were simon snatched up the pyramid of the world and ran towards her come on he said they hate it pardon said esk use the staff said simon urgently and reached out for it hey it bit me sorry said esk what were we talking about she looked up and regarded the keening things as it were for the first time oh those they only exist inside our heads if we didnt believe in them they wouldnt exist at all simon looked around at them i cant honestly say i believe you he said i think we should go home now said esk people will be worrying she moved her hands together and the staff vanished although for a moment her hands glowed as though they were cupped around a candle the things howled a few of them fell over the important thing about magic is how you dont use it said esk taking simons arm he stared at the crumbling figures around him and grinned foolishly you dont use it he queried oh yes said esk as they walked towards the things try it yourself she extended her hands brought the staff out of the air and offered it to him he went to take it then drew back his hand uh no he said i dont think it likes me much i think its all right if i give it to you it cant really argue with that said esk where does it go it just becomes an idea of itself i think he reached out his hand again and closed his fingers around the shining wood right he said and raised it in the classical revengeful wizards pose ill show them no wrong what do you mean wrong ive got the power theyre sort ofreflections of us said esk you cant beat your reflections theyll always be as strong as you are thats why they draw nearer to you when you start using magic and they dont get tired they feed off magic so you cant beat them with magic no the thing is well not using magic because you cant thats no use at all but not using magic because you can that really upsets them they hate the idea if people stopped using magic theyd die the things ahead of them fell over each other in their haste to back away simon looked at the staff then at esk then at the things then back at the staff this needs a lot of thinking about he said uncertainly id really like to work this out i expect youll do it very well because youre saying that the real power is when you go right through magic and out the other side it works though doesnt it they were alone on the cold plain now the things were distant stickfigures i wonder if this is what they mean by sourcery said simon i dont know it might be id really like to work this out said simon again turning the staff over and over in his hands we could set up some experiments you know into deliberately not using magic we could carefully not draw an octogram on the floor and we could deliberately not call up all sorts of things and it makes me sweat just to think about it id like to think about how to get home said esk looking down at the pyramid well that is supposed to be my idea of the world i should be able to find a way how do you do this thing with the hands he moved his hands together the staff slid between them the light glowing through his fingers for a moment and then vanished he grinned right now all we have to do is look for the university cutangle lit his third rollup from the stub of the second this last cigarette owed a lot to the creative powers of nervous energy and looked like a camel with the legs cut off he had already watched the staff lift itself gently from esk and land on simon now it had floated up into the air again other wizards had crowded into the room the librarian was sitting under the table if only we had some idea what is going on said cutangle its the suspense i cant stand think positively man snapped granny and put out that bloody cigarette i cant imagine anyone wanting to come back to a room that smells like a fireplace as one man the assembled college of wizards turned their faces towards cutangle expectantly he took the smouldering mess out of his mouth and with a glare that none of the assembled wizards cared to meet trod it underfoot probably time i gave it up anyway he said that goes for the rest of you too worse than an ashpit in this place sometimes then he saw the staff it was the only way cutangle could describe the effect was that it seemed to be going very fast while staying in exactly the same place streamers of gas flared away from it and vanished if they were gas it blazed like a comet designed by an inept special effects man coloured sparks leapt out and disappeared somewhere it was also changing colour starting with a dull red and then climbing through the spectrum until it was a painful violet snakes of white fire coruscated along its length there should be a word for words that sound like things would sound like if they made a noise he thought the word glisten does indeed gleam oily and if there was ever a word that sounded exactly the way sparks look as they creep across burned paper or the way the lights of cities would creep across the world if the whole of human civilisation was crammed into one night then you couldnt do better than coruscate he knew what would happen next look out he whispered its going to go in total silence in the kind of silence in fact that sucks in sounds and stifles them the staff flashed into pure octarine along the whole of its length the eighth colour produced by light falling through a strong magical field blazed out through bodies and bookshelves and walls other colours blurred and ran together as though the light was a glass of gin poured over the watercolour painting of the world the clouds over the university glowed twisted into fascinating and unexpected shapes and streamed upwards an observer above the disc would have seen a little patch of land near the circle sea sparkle like a jewel for several seconds then wink out the silence of the room was broken by a wooden clatter as the staff dropped out of the air and bounced on the table someone said ook very faintly cutangle eventually remembered how to use his hands and raised them to where he hoped his eyes would be everything had gone black is anyone else there he said gods you dont know how glad i am to hear you say that said another voice the silence was suddenly full of babble are we still where we were i dont know where were we here i think can you reach out not unless i am quite certain about what im going to touch my good man said the unmistakable voice of granny weatherwax everyone try and reach out said cutangle and choked down a scream as a hand like a warm leather glove closed around his ankle there was a satisfied little ook which managed to convey relief comfort and the sheer joy of touching a fellow human being or in this case anthropoid there was a scratch and then a blessed flare of red light as a wizard on the far side of the room lit a cigarette who did that sorry archchancellor force of habit smoke all you like that man thank you archchancellor i think i can see the outline of the door now said another voice granny yes i can definitely see esk im here granny can i smoke too sir is the boy with you yes ook im here whats happening everyone stop talking ordinary light slow and easy on the eye sidled back into the library esk sat up dislodging the staff it rolled under the table she felt something slip over her eyes and reached up for it just a moment said granny darting forward she gripped the girls shoulders and peered into her eyes welcome back she said and kissed her esk reached up and patted something hard on her head she lifted it down to examine it it was a pointed hat slightly smaller than grannys but bright blue with a couple of silver stars painted on it a wizard hat she said cutangle stepped forward ah yes he said and cleared his throat you see we thought it seemed anyway when we considered it youre a wizard said granny simply the archchancellor changed the lore quite a simple ceremony really theres the staff somewhere about here said cutangle i saw it fall down oh he stood up with the staff in his hand and showed it to granny i thought it had carvings on he said this looks just like a stick and that was a fact the staff looked as menacing and potent as a piece of kindling esk turned the hat around in her hands in the manner of one who opening the proverbial brightlywrapped package finds bath salts its very nice she said uncertainly is that all you can say said granny its pointed too somehow being a wizard didnt feel any different from not being a wizard simon leaned over remember he said youve got to have been a wizard then you can start looking on the other side like you said their eyes met and they grinned granny stared at cutangle he shrugged search me he said whats happened to your stutter boy seems to have gone sir said simon brightly must have left it behind somewhere the river was still brown and swollen but at least it resembled a river again it was unnaturally hot for late autumn and across the whole of the lower part of ankhmorpork the steam rose from thousands of carpets and blankets put out to dry the streets were filled with silt which on the whole was an improvement ankhmorporks impressive civic collection of dead dogs had been washed out to sea the steam also rose from the flagstones of the archchancellors personal verandah and from the teapot on the table granny lay back in an ancient cane chair and let the unseasonal warmth creep around her ankles she idly watched a team of city ants who had lived under the flagstones of the university for so long that the high levels of background magic had permanently altered their genes anthandling a damp sugar lump down from the bowl on to a tiny trolley another group was erecting a matchstick gantry at the edge of the table granny may or may not have been interested to learn that one of the ants was drum billet who had finally decided to give life another chance they say she said that if you can find an ant on hogswatch day it will be very mild for the rest of the winter who says that said cutangle generally people who are wrong said granny i makes a note in my almanack see i checks most things most people believe are wrong like red sky at night the citys alight said cutangle and you cant teach an old dog new tricks i dont think thats what old dogs are for said granny the sugar lump had reached the gantry now and a couple of ants were attaching it to a microscopic block and tackle i cant understand half the things simon says said cutangle although some of the students get very excited about it i understand what esk says all right i just dont believe it said granny except the bit about wizards needing a heart she said that witches need a head too said cutangle would you like a scone a bit damp im afraid she told me that if magic gives people what they want then not using magic can give them what they need said granny her hand hovering over the plate so simon tells me i dont understand it myself magics for using not storing up go on spoil yourself magic beyond magic snorted granny she took the scone and spread jam on it after a pause she spread cream on it too the sugar lump crashed to the flagstones and was immediately surrounded by another team of ants ready to harness it to a long line of red ants enslaved from the kitchen garden cutangle shifted uneasily in his seat which creaked esmerelda he began ive been meaning to ask no said granny actually i was going to say that we think we might allow a few more girls into the university on an experimental basis once we get the plumbing sorted out said cutangle thats up to you of course and and it occurred to me that since we seem destined to become a coeducational establishment as it were it seemed to me that is well if you might see your way clear to becoming that is whether you would accept a chair he sat back the sugar lump passed under his chair on matchstick rollers the squeaking of the slavedriver ants just at the edge of hearing hmm said granny i dont see why not ive always wanted one of those big wicker ones you know with the sort of sunshade bit on the top if thats not too much trouble that isnt exactly what i meant said cutangle adding quickly although im sure that could be arranged no i mean would you come and lecture the students once in a while what on cutangle groped for a subject herbs he hazarded were not very good on herbs here and headology esk told me a lot about headology it sounds fascinating the sugar lump disappeared through a crack in a nearby wall with a final jerk cutangle nodded towards it theyre very heavy on the sugar he said but we havent got the heart to do anything about it granny frowned and then nodded across the haze over the city to the distant glitter of the snow on the ramtops its a long way she said i cant be keeping on going backwards and forwards at my time of life we could buy you a much better broomstick said cutangle one you dont have to bump start and you you could have a flat here and all the old clothes you can carry he added using the secret weapon he had wisely invested in some conversation with mrs whitlow mmph said granny silk black and red said cutangle an image of granny in black and red silk trotted across his mind and he bit heavily into his scone and maybe we can bring some students out to your cottage in the summer cutangle went on for extramural studies whos extra muriel i mean theres lots they can learn im sure granny considered this certainly the privy needed a good seeingto before the weather got too warm and the goat shed was ripe for the muckingout by spring digging over the herb bed was a chore too the bedroom ceiling was a disgrace and some of the tiles needed fixing practical things she said thoughtfully absolutely said cutangle mmph well ill think about it said granny dimly aware that one should never go too far on a first date perhaps you would care to dine with me this evening and let me know said cutangle his eyes agleam whats to eat cold meat and potatoes mrs whitlow had done her work well there was esk and simon went on to develop a whole new type of magic that no one could exactly understand but which nevertheless everyone considered very worthwhile and somehow comforting perhaps more importantly the ants used all the sugar lumps they could steal to build a small sugar pyramid in one of the hollow walls in which with great ceremony they entombed the mummified body of a dead queen on the wall of one tiny hidden chamber they inscribed in insect hieroglyphs the true secret of longevity they got it absolutely right and it would probably have important implications for the universe if it hadnt next time the university flooded been completely washed away the end
