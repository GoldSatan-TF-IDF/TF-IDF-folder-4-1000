authors note this was the second of my books to be published twentythree years ago it took me nearly three years to write because i was working as an engineer on the construction of an airship and i wrote only in the evenings in the intervals of more important technical work it was written through from start to finish twice andsome of it three times clearly i was still obsessed with standard subjects as a source of drama spying detection and murder so seldom encountered by real people in real life perhaps i was beginning to break loose from these constraints the reader must judge that for himself in revising the book for reissue i have altered half a dozen outmoded pieces of slang but i have made no other changes the book achieved publication in the united states under the somewhat uninspiring title the mysterious aviator nevil shute preface the greater part of this book is based upon my written statement to the foreign secretary dated april th reference has also been made to the official notes of my evidence before the italian secret police given through the british viceconsul at san remo on march th and to the deposition sworn before the italian civil authorities by captain philip stenning dso mc upon the same day i am indebted to the foreign office for permission to redraft the less confidential portions of these documents and to lord arner for permission to detail certain personal events without which this account would hardly be complete these are the dry bones of my story and it may well be urged that the time has not yet come when they can be brought to life unbiased but memory is short in this book and before my recollections have grown dim with the great assistance of my wife i have tried to set down something of the history of that great pilot and most involuntary adventurer who came to me in the night stayed with me for five days and went peter l moran the old hall under sussex and then none shall be unto them so odious and disdained as the traitours who have solde their countrie to a straunger and forsaken their faith and obedience contrarie to nature or religion and contrarie to that humane and generall honour not onely of christians but of heathen and irreligious nations who have always stained what labour soever and embraced even death itself for their countrie prince and commonwealth sir walter raleigh one as i have said this matter started in the night i was agent to lord arner at that time steward and agent for most of the family affairs passed through my hands and i ran the outdoor business of the house itself i lived by myself in the stewards house at under hall about a couple of miles from the little town of under in west sussex i live there still very late on the night of which i am writing i was driving home over the south downs after a dinner in winchester i forget for the moment what that dinner was about i do not think it can have been connected with my old school because i was driving home in a very bad temper and so i think it must have been the corn association they tell me that i am reactionary very likely they are right but they should give a man a better dinner than that before they tell him so in any case all that is beside the point i started home to drive the forty odd miles from winchester to under at about halfpast eleven that night it was march a fine bight with a pack of loose cloud in front of the moon that gradually turned to rain i was in a dinnerjacket but the hood of my old morris is pretty watertight i could take the rain phlegmatically and so i set the wiper going jammed my foot down a bit harder and wished i was in bed with a fire in my bedroom instead of bucketing along at forty miles an hour over the black country roads now on that run from winchester to under you pass over giveandtake sort of country for most of the way but about ten miles from under the road gets up on to the high ground by leventer and runs along the top for a couple of miles that two miles runs with a fairly good surface straight over the unfenced down you can let a car out there in the daytime but at night you have to be careful because of the cattle it was about halfpast twelve when i came swinging up over that bit of down that night doing about forty and keeping a sharp lookout for sheep the night was as black as the pit by that time the rain was coming down pretty hard there was no traffic on the road at that time of night i sat there sucking my dead pipe and thinking no evil watched the rain beat against the windscreen watching the wiper flick it off again and thanked my lucky stars that i wasnt out in it about halfway along that stretch of down i passed a man on the road he was walking along in the direction of under i didnt see very much of him as i passed because the rain blurred the windscreen except just where the wiper caught it and i was going at a fair pace he seemed to be a tallish wellsetup fellow in a leather coat but without a hat the water was fairly streaming and glistening off him in my headlights i drove past then it struck me that it was a pretty rotten trick to drive by and leave a man out on the road in a night like that i jammed both feet hard down and we stopped with a squeal about twenty yards beyond him i stuck my pipe in my pocket switched on the dashboard light leaned over and opened the door want a lift into under i called on a night like that i should have expected to hear his footsteps squelching along at the side of the road when i didnt i turned and looked out of the little window at tine back he seemed to have stopped dead i fancied that i could see him dimly in the rain standing by the side of the road in the red light of my tail lamp the rain came beating steadily against the car with little patterings to put it frankly i thought it was our local idiot in a job like mine one gets to know the look of those chaps and the way they wander about the country in the worst weather often with no hat on we have a good few naturals about my part of the world and they dont come to much harm their people seem them about the place and theyre good with animals in any case it was arotten night for an idiot to be out it didnt much matter to me what time i got to bed now and i had a fancy to collect this chap and see him safely home his people live at a farm about five miles off that road more or less on the way to under i thought that he was frightened at the sudden stopping of the car and so i slid along the seat and stuck my head out of the door to reassure him all right ben i said they call him ben im mr moran from under hall ill take you back home in the car if youll come with me its a rotten wet night for walking thats right stay where you are and ill bring the car back to you then you can come in out of the wet i slipped the gear into reverse and ran the car back along the road to him he was still standing motionless by the grass i could see him in the gleam of the tail lamp through the little window i stopped the car when he was opposite the door come on in i said its all wet out there you know me mr moran he moved at last and stooped towards the door its very good of you he said its not much of a night for walking i knew he wasnt an idiot as soon as i heard his voice of course and while i was wondering why he had held back from accepting a lift upon a night like that he stuck his head in under the hood and followed it with his body he settled himself into his seat and turned to face me im going as far as under he said quietly if you could put me down at the station id be very grateful he had a lean tanned face which he was wiping with a khaki handkerchief his hair was straight and black and fell down wetly over his forehead towards his eyes in the road the rain dripped monotonously from the car in little liquid notes that mingled with the purring of the engine i stared at him for a minute he returned my stare unmoved my name is moran i said at last arent you maurice lenden we met in the flying corps in ninetytwo squadron in about june or july i remember you quite well now i paused and eyed him curiously its funny how one runs across people he avoided my eyes you must be mixing me up with someone else he said uncertainly my name is james from the way he spoke i knew that he was lying but apart from that i never forget a face if i wasnt pretty good that way i shouldnt have been agent to lord arner i knew as certainly as i was sitting there that he was lenden i remembered that i had met him since the war at a reunion dinner in or i remembered that somebody had told me that he was still flying as a civilian aeroplane pilot and there was something else that i had heard about him in gossip with some old flying corps men in town quite recently divorce or something of the sort at the moment i couldnt bring that to mind i wrinkled my brows and glanced at him again and for the first time i noticed his clothes it was probably the clothes which brought him to my mind so readily at first damn it the man was dressed for flying he had no hat but he wore a long heavy leather coat with pockets at the knee there was a map sticking out of one of these all sodden with the rain he had altered very little in those clothes he might have come walking into the mess in when i used to play that game myself below the coat he was wearing sheepskin thighboots reaching high above the knee with the fur inside i was so positive that i smiled james or lenden i said im damn glad to see you again been flying i suppose i was a bit riled at his refusal to know me i was watching him as i spoke and i saw his lips tighten irritably but all he said was i should bet very grateful for a lift into under if youre going that way the rain streamed down into the headlights and the wiper flicked uneasily upon the windscreen you wont get a train from under tonight i said and youll have your work cut out to wake them at the pub its a rotten hole if youre lenden youd better come along back with me theres a spare room in my place that you can have dare say i can fix you up with a pair of pyjamas too he was about to say something but hesitated and then its very good of you he muttered but id rather go on i sat there staring at him in perplexity he was hugging a little square black case in the crook of his arm but at the moment it didnt strike me what that was i couldnt understand why he had given me a false name and then it struck me that hed made a damn poor show of it if he wanted to get away unnoticed and that i could have done it very much better myself but that was in keeping with the man as i remembered him he was a simple soul and quite incapable of any sustained deception look here i said at last purely as a matter of general interest where have you come from youve been flying havent you i see youre in flying kit he didnt answer for a minute but then i had a forced landing he said here he jerked his head towards the down just over there i wrinkled my brows how long ago about an hour hour and a half perhaps just before the rain came i leaned forward on the wheel and stared at him i couldnt make out for the moment whether to believe a word of what he said there was something wrong about him and i didnt know what it was he wasnt drunk i thought it might be drugs he didnt sound natural his talk about a forced landing seemed to me to be all nonsense ive been a pilot myself and i know when one is in sole charge of a machine worth several thousand pounds and one has just put it down very suddenly and unexpectedly and hard one doesnt just go off and leave it especially on a night like that the rain drummed steadily upon the fabric of the hood you are lenden arent you i inquired he laughed shortly and a little selfconsciously yes im lenden he said just my infernal luck running up against a man like you ive been a regular jonah lately and he laughed again thanks i said dryly he stirred uneasily in his seat lets get on he muttered right you are i said and slipped in the gear i didnt want to go ferreting about in his affairs if he wanted to keep them to himself you werent speaking the truth by any chance when you said youd had a forced landing that stung him up a bit youll know in the morning i suppose he replied theyll find the machine i slipped it out again damn it i said do you mean youve got an aeroplane out there he nodded did you crash her no shes all right but for the oil pressure it was that that brought me down i could make nothing of his way of treating the affair what have you done with her i asked theres a barn about half a mile down the hill over there did you get her under the lee of that he looked embarrassed i just left her where she was i gazed at him blankly hardly able to believe my ears it was the sort of thing a novice might have said not a pilot of his experience after all one expects a man to do his best for the machine do you mean she isnt pegged down or anything he shook his head i just left her i leaned forward and switched off the engine of the car but damn it all i said shell blow away he didnt stir let her he said i knew then that it must be drugs we cant do that i said irritably shell be blowing about all over the country on a night like this it riled me that i should have to get out of the car into the rain in my dinnerjacket to go and tie up this mans aeroplane hut there seemed to be nothing for it i reached out and took an electric torch from the dashboard pocket and nudged him come on i said get out were going to peg her down get on with it he didnt move i paused for a moment he seemed to make something of an effort look here moran he said lets get going to under that machines all right where she is leaving her loose i asked he nodded thats right leave her loose look here i dont want to bother about her just take me along to under and drop me at the station well drugs are the devil cant do that old boy i said cheerfully shes on our land lord arners land it might cost us a couple of pounds if she blew through a hedge leaving her loose like that more perhaps i shoved him towards the door come on lets go and have a look at her he shrugged his shoulders if you like i had a couple of garden forks and a hank of cord in the back of the car as luck would have it that id got in winchester for the house there was a strap in the dickey too i took the lot out wrapped my raincoat closely round me swore a little and set out with lenden across the down it was infernally dark the lights of the car behind us gave us a direction and prevented us from wandering in circles on the slopes lenden didnt know where he had left the machine but thought that he had walked for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before he hit the road we went stumbling on into the darkness for a bit flashing my torch in every direction presently i stopped it was pretty hopeless to go on groping for her that way on a night like that r did you land into wind i asked he nodded it was pure guesswork of course the wind must have been a bit under the starboard wing because she went down to port as i touched still i got her up again so she cant have been far wrong right said i now did you land uphill or down he considered for a moment uphill by the feel of it he said vaguely she pulled up pretty quickly yes im sure it was uphill not much of a slope though you had lights to land by wingtip flares they burnt out as soon as i was on the ground so i couldnt see much he hesitated i say lets leave the ruddy thing i disregarded that and stood thinking about it for a minute if he had landed uphill and into wind it localized the machine pretty well especially as it was only ten minutes walk from the road i bore round to the right and began to traverse the only uphill slope that faced into the wind we found her at the top of the down where the slope was gentle i heard her before we got the light on her a series of drumming crashes as the loose rudder flicked over from hardaport to hardastarboard and then to port again i switched the light in that direction and there she was facing more or less into wind with the controls slamming free he hadnt even troubled to drop the belt around the stick damn fine way to leave a machine i muttered if he heard lenden did not reply that was a very big aeroplane i hadnt flown myself since when i went down with a bullet through my chest to spend the remainder of the war in germany i thought that i had forgotten all about that game but now i am inclined to regard it as one of those things that no man ever really forgets an old pilot will always linger a little over the photographs of aeroplanes on the back page of the daily mail that is the only way in which i can account for the fact that i knew that machine by sight the french had been doing a number of recordbreaking longdistance flights upon the type i stood there in the rain for a minute playing the torch upon the wings and fuselage and wondered what on earth lenden was doing with a french highspeed bomber where dyou get the breguet from lenden i asked he hesitated for a moment ive been doing a job on her he said vaguely there was no point in standing there in the rain questioning a man who didnt want to talk the first thing was to stop those controls slamming about i made him get up into the cockpit and tighten the belt around the stick he obeyed me quietly then we set about pegging her down for the night in a quarter of an hour it was done wed buried the garden forks beneath each wingtip and stamped the sods down over them lashing the wing loosely to them with the cord that was the best that we could do in the circumstances it was a pretty rotten job when if was done but it only had to hold till daylight i didnt think it was going to blow hard i went all round before we left to have a final look that everything was shipshape the wind went sighing through the wires in the darkness and the rain beat and drummed most desolately upon the fabric of the wings flashing my light under the fuselage i saw a sort of blunt snout four or five inches in diameter sticking out down below the clean lines of the body i stooped curiously and ran my fingers over the bottom of it there was a lens all right said lenden from the darkness behind me its a camera i straightened up and thought of the black packet that he had left in the car but i had had enough of asking questions lets get along back to under i said and turned towards the lights of the car unless youre staying here he shook his head and we went stumbling through the rain over the down towards the car i was thoroughly wet by the time we got there and not in the best of tempers id done my best to help the man for the sate of old times but i couldnt help feeling a bit hurt at the way that he had received the assistance i had given him and it was a funny business too i didnt see what he was doing with a breguet xix in england and i didnt see what had brought him to make a forced landing with it in the middle of the night and it was very evident that he didnt want to tell me we reached the car in silence and bundled in out of the wet i paused for a moment before pressing the starter youd better come along back with me to my place i suggested he seemed embarrassed at that its very good of you he said diffidently but id rather go straight to the station im in a hurry you wont do much good at the station at this time of night i remarked there isnt a train till twenty past seven i considered for a moment and added youd better come along with me and sleep on the sofa if you want to catch that train therell be a fire to sleep by which is more than youll find at the station i eyed him thoughtfully theres nobody else in the house im a bachelor i dont quite know why i added that he hesitated again and gave in all right he said at last id like to very much we were about five miles from under hall i lived there in the stewards house just across the stableyard from the mansion it had been the most convenient arrangement in every way arner himself was over seventy years old and too busy a man to occupy himself with the management of his estate his only son was in persia it was no great shakes as a job but it suited me the screw wasnt much to boast about but i had a small income of my own that was getting gradually larger with judicious nursing and the family treated me as an equal its the sort of job that im cut out for i was articled to a solicitor some years before the war though i was countrybred i tried it again for a year after the armistice and then i gave it up i should have made a rotten lawyer i drove into the stableyard at about a quarterpast two that night left the car in the coachhouse and walked across to my own place with lenden the stewards house at under is built into the grey stone wall that separates the gardens from the stableyard and the one big livingroom has rather a pleasant outlook on the right side of the wall there are three little bedrooms and a kitchen it suited me to live there they had banked up the fire for me and left a cold meal on the table with a jug of beer standing in the grate there was a cold pie i remember and a potato salad i threw off my coat kicked the fire into a blaze gave lenden the use of my room for a wash and settled down with him for a late supper i didnt eat much at that time in the morning but lenden seemed hungry and made quite a heavy meal i lit my pipe and sat there lazily with my back to the fare waiting and smoking till he had finished between the mouthfuls he talked in a desultory manner about the war the squadron was reequipped late in after i was shot down with bristol fighters i had heard that later they got moved to a place near abbeville he got shot through the thigh soon after that and his observer was killed in the same fight and he crashed in our support trenches he became an instructor at stamford when he came out of hospital and afterwards at netheravon yes he supposed hed been luckier than most damn sight better off than if youd been in germany i said shortly you didnt stay on at all after the war i paused someone told me that standish had gone back i said and watched the smoke curl into the darkness above the lamp shortservice commission or something i forget who it was he nodded he did but i came straight out at armistice he glanced at me darkly across the table i was married got married in august an i wanted to be out of it make a home for my girl an all that sort of thing he grinned without laughing like hell i nodded absently lenden had finished eating went joyriding with a fellow from twentyone squadron that summer he said early summer of just after the war we had an avro seaplane he mused over it for a minute my god wed got a lot to learn in those days we took our wives with us for one thing he leaned his head upon his hands and began to tell me about this joyriding concern they spent practically the whole of their savings and gratuity upon this seaplane and they started in with it to tour the south coast towns giving joyrides at a guinea a head in the prevailing optimism of those days they thought that they could make it pay perhaps if they had had a land machine they might have got away with it in spite of their total lack of business experience lenden with the knowledge that he had gained in later years had no illusions on that point but he himself put down their failure to the difficulty of operating the machine from the beach of a crowded seaside resort and he talked for a long time about that handling the machine on to the beach thats what did us in properly damn it it took the hell of a time days when there was a sea breeze id come in to land over the town sideslipping down over the houses and the promenade we were always getting pulled up for flying too low over the promenade they didnt think about our having a living to get out of their ruddy town he stared morosely at the tablecloth the sea breeze was hell id land a couple of hundred yards out and then turn to taxi in to the beach then the fun began and wed come taxiing in to the beach with a twentymile wind behind blowing us straight on to the sand we hit the beach like that once or twice when we were new to the game an stove in a float each time when we got sick of patching floats i used to try and swing her round into the wind again at the last moment to check her way often as not id get outside the stretch of shore the council had roped off for us in doing that and go driving in among the bathers that meant stopping the prop for fear of hitting them and blowing ashore on to the beach and there was always a row about it afterwards we never got more than three tenminute joyrides done in the hour he said and the engine running the whole time it meant that we had to make the charge thirty shillings a flight and so it came to an end they began operations in may at brighton by july they were in difficulties and in september they gave up they were lucky in that they were able to sell the machine and in that way they realized sufficient of their capital to pay off most of the bills and to leave them with about fifty pounds each in hand i sent my wife back to her people for a bit said lenden that was the first time he relapsed into silence and sat there brooding over the table and when he spoke again i was suddenly sorry for the man its ruddy good fun having to do that he said quietly especially when its the first time he went on to tell me that he had been out of a job then for about two months hanging about the aerodromes and living on what he could pick up he bought and sold one or two old cars at a profit in those days there was ready money to be made that way and so be eked out his little means until he got a job at hounslow with at and t i raised my head inquiringly aircraft transport and travel he replied on the paris route we used to fly nines and sixteens from hounslow to le bourget and get through as best you could later on we moved to croydon i nodded i crossed that way once they gave us paper bags to be sick into dare say it was all right while the fine weather lasted but in the winter it was rotten rotten no ground organization to help you no wireless or weather reports in those days days when it was too thick to see the tree beyond the aerodrome we used to ring up the harbour master at folkestone and get a weather report from him but we didnt do that much and people used to pay to come with us he said slowly on days like that he rested his chin upon one hand and stared across the white table into the shadows of the room ive taken a sixteen off from hounslow with a full load of passengers when the clouds were right down to the ground he said and flown all the way to the coast without ever getting more than two hundred feet up time and again jerking her nose up into a zoom when you came to a tree or a church and letting her down again the other side sos you could see the ground again at over a hundred miles an hour crossing the channel like that ten minutes in a cold sweat praying to god that your compass was right and your engine would stick it out and youd see the cliffs the other side before you hit and then at the end of it all to have to land in a field halfway between the coast and le bourget because it was getting too thick for safety he paused it was wicked he said they used to carry the much advertised air mails that meant that the machines had to fly whether there were passengers to be carried or not it was left to the discretion of the pilot whether or not the flight should be cancelled in bad weather the pilots were dead keen and went on flying in the most impossible conditions sanderson got killed that way he said at douinville an all he had in the machine was a couple of picture postcards from trippers in paris sent to their families in england as a curiosity that was the air mail no passengers or anything just the mail he thought for a little now that was a funny thing he said quietly sanderson hit a tree on top of a little cliff and he died about a week later an all the time in the hospital he was explaining to the nurse how hed put his machine in through the roof of the coliseum and what a pity it was because there was a damn good show going on at the time and hed gone and spoilt it all and presently he died we got a bit more careful after that he said for lenden that had been a good job he told me that he had been making about nine hundred a year while it lasted he took a little flat in croydon and lived there with his wife for twelve months or so that was a fine time he said the best ive ever had wed got plenty of money for the first time since we were married an mollie liked the flat all right and she made it simply great we thought we was going on for ever an we were beginning to make plans to get into a house with a bit of garden where we could have fruit trees and things and we were going to have a pack o kids two or three of them as soon as we got settled there was silence in the room for a minute you cant run a show like that without a subsidy he said at last or you couldnt in those days with the equipment we had it lasted on into the winter of then aircraft transport and travel it was a damn good name that they packed up and that was the end of that he was staring into the shadows at the far end of the room and speaking in a very quiet voice i had heard something of that early failure in the heroic period of aviation but this was the first time that i had heard a personal account this time he was longer out of a job the flat in croydon was broken up and his wife went back again to her people while lenden went wandering around the south of england in his search for flying work the time had gone by when motor cars could be bought and sold at a profit by those outside the trade and i gathered that by the end of four months his wifes parents were financing him in the end he found a job again in his own line of business as pilot for an aerial survey to be made in honduras dyou ever meet sam robertson he inquired he was an observer in the war and he got this contract for a survey for the development trust raked round in the city and got it all off his own bat and he got me in on it to do the flying for him in honduras theyd taken over a concession up the patuca theres lashings of copper up there if only you could get it out lashings of it this survey was one of the first shows of that sort to be done it was a seaplane job sam bought a fairey with a rolls eagle in her from the disposals crowd and we left for belize in march it meant leaving mollie with her people he said i could make her a pretty fair allowance of course id got the money then for as long as the job lasted i stirred in my chair was this a photographic survey then i asked he nodded in a way the contract didnt run to a proper mosaic of photographs there wasnt any need for it for what they wanted and anyway wed have had a job to line it up because theres never been any sort of ground work done there to give you a grid no we picked up one of their people at trujillo a fellow called wilson who was their resident out there and he came on up the patuca with us we did most of the work with oblique photographs and each evening he made up a rough map of the country wed flown over he paused it was the copper he was mostly interested in you can tell it by the colour of the trees you know they look all dusty and dried up from the air different to the rest of the jungle you can see the copper areas quite clearly that way he said it was the devil of a country from belize they had gone by a little coastal steamer brazilianowned to trujillo there they erected the machine on the beach in the sun the inhabitants were a sort of indian very quiet and mostly diseased they used to come and sit round staring at us without saying anything at all he said and then when wed sweated a bucket wed go in to the pub and drink with the dagoes it was a rotten place that rotten when the machine was ready they sent a launch full of stores round by sea to the mouth of the patuca he told me that the concession was about a hundred miles up the river wilson went with the launch lenden and robertson gave them three days start and went after them in the seaplane in a couple of hours flight they had passed the launch and then they carried on up the river to the agreed meeting place jutigalpa he told me that that was a glorified mud village with a spanishspeaking halfcaste to collect a few taxes from the indians they lived in a native hut picketing the machine in the shade of the trees on the beach that was to be their home for the next six months they started flying operations as soon as the launch arrived they had a very fat mechanic meyer by name within the first three days he was down with fever and some form of heat apoplexy and had to be sent back to trujillo in the launch that delayed them for a week then they carried on with the flying and had surveyed about a third of the area when they crashed a float lenden in taxiing the machine on the water ran her over a submerged snag which ripped their port float from bow to stern he was fortunate in being able to run the machine ashore before she sank and there we were he said for the next three months till we got a new float out from england wilson went back with robertson to trujillo to send the order and then robertson came back to jutigalpa and we built a sort of palmleaf hut over the machine with the indians and then we just sat on our backsides in that rotten little hole and waited for the float when the float came they repaired the machine and carried on finishing the survey in about six weeks from the point of view of the development trust it was a success they had found out what they wanted to know about their land cheaply and accurately we finished the job and came back to trujillo said lenden the coals fell together with a little crash it was about halfpast three in the morning i had lost all desire to go to bed now that lenden was talking freely i wanted to hear the end of his story i knew what was coming gradually and in his own way he was working up to the point of telling me what he had been doing with that breguet on the down i wanted to know about that i swung round pitched one or two more lumps of coal into the grate and poked them up lenden got up absently from the table and came and threw himself down into a chair before the fire no he said at last you wouldnt have heard about ft here but there was a tornado out there that year sam robertson arid i settled down at trujillo for a few weeks while he got in touch with some of the mines in nicaragua we thought that while we were there we might get one or two more jobs of the same sort in that district and wilson gave us a whole lot of help in getting them wed just about fixed to go down to the santa vanua it was a sort of forestry survey that they wanted there when the storm came he was staring into the fire and speaking very quietly it came one evening quite suddenly we had the fairey pegged down upon the beach in the lee of a cliff it was the only place we had to put her but no pickets could have stood against that wind we got the whole town out to hold her down i dare say there were fifty of us hanging on to her in the dusk and she blew clean out of our hands and away up the beach he glanced at me she was all we had you know the whole capital sam and i hung on to her after she took charge and she chucked us off like a horse robertson fell soft but i broke an arm as i went down he passed his hand absently up bis left forearm yes she was all we had and she went flying up the beach till she cartwheeled into a little corrugatediron hut and knocked it flat and then on what was left of her till she fetched up against the forest we lay on the beach all that night because we could hear the houses crashing in the town and robertson made splints for my arm and when the morning came and it blew itself out half the houses in the place were down and sam was as rich as me thats rotten luck i muttered he nodded yes it was bad luck because there was all the makings of a survey business out there but that finished us and we came home third class and so he gave up aviation he had been bitten three times and hed enough of it he wanted to settle down he said and live with his wife he told me that he had come to the conclusion out in trujillo that flying was no good for a married man and that he must look for more stable employment in the future he realized that he would have to start at the bottom wilson stepped in there and gave him an introduction to a cousin who ran a firm of wholesale clothiers in st pauls churchyard and lenden came home to england to start work in the city on four pounds ten a week with robertson he had been getting seven hundred a year i took mollie out of pawn again he said a little bitterly and we got furnished rooms between eltham and lewisham not very far from her people and that year it went all right he stared into the fire i was the proper city gent mr everyman i wore a bowler hat and a morning coat like all the other stiffs and carried a pair of gloves and read the daily mail going up and the evening news coming down it seemed to have been a poor sort of job from the first there was little chance that he could make a success of it the clerks with whom he worked had forgotten more about business than he had ever known he was unsuited for it temperamentally and he was getting fifteen shillings a week more than the others which didnt make things any easier for him and he was desperately hard up he couldnt live on his pay his wifes parents had to come forward again and make him a substantial allowance and that got him on the raw he told me all this that night he stuck it out for two years i chucked it in the early summer of he said and shot the ash from his cigarette into the fire its the spring that gets you in a job like that when the days begin to get a bit warm and sunny an you know you could make better money out in the clean country on an aerodrome he was quiet for a little after that and then he said we were right on the rocks by then and not a chance of things getting any better i was still on four pounds ten a week the way i put it to the old man i said i simply had to go where i stood a chance of earning a bit money it wasnt good enough to stick on like that he cut up pretty rough about it but i was through with the city mollie went home again for a bit and i went back to the old game it was joyriding again this time as a paid pilot to a concern called the atalanta flying services the atalanta flying services was a threeseater avro painted a bright scarlet all over the pilot who had been flying her before had just cut off with all the loose cash in the kitty and while they tracked him down lenden got the job to carry on this time however the directors put a secretary into the concern to keep him company ive picked up the machine at gloucester he said where the other fellow left her when he vanished there were four of us in the game there was the secretary a chap called carpenter and a ground engineer and an oddjob man and myself we had the avro and a ford lorry that was all coveredin with tarpaulins and fitted up for sleeping and living in and a cowley twoseater carpenter used to drive the cowley up in front and get to the next town a day or so ahead of us and fix up the landingground with the farmer and get out the posters he thought for a minute i dare say youve seen the posters he said we came all round this part of the country we had em printed in red very big and staring like this watch for the red aeroplane youve seen people walking on the wings at the cinema but have you ever seen it with your own eyes have you ever flown in an aeroplane at a dizzy height above the ground while a man walked coolly to the extreme tips of the wings no but you can next week the atalanta flying services are coming with captain lenden mc who shot down fourteen enemy machines in the war and is one of britains most experienced airmen the air ministry have certified that captain lenden is absolutely safe flying daily from shotover farm by kind permission of mr joshua phillips and a lot more of the same sort of thing he said you know two very happy years followed the job was one that suited lenden it was a country life with few business worries the pay worked out at about four hundred and fifty and that enabled him to make a respectable allowance to his wife though he seldom had an opportunity of seeing her with the avro the ford lorry and the morriscowley the atalanta flying services went wandering and for the first eighteen months wherever they wandered they made money they were entirely selfcontained we did it this way he said wed pick our field and put up a fence of sackcloth round as much of it as we could we charged sixpence for admission to see the flying just by the entrance we had the lorry and we used it as a sort of office in the day at night we used to picket the machine as close to the van as we could get her and then turn in all snug for the night they went all over the country in the next two years staying ten days at each little town from gloucester they worked down through devon into cornwall then back along the whole length of the south coast till in the winter of they found themselves in kent at croydon they overhauled the machine and went north into essex and up the coast to sheringham and cromer in they went right up the east coast as far as edinburgh and back through the midlands till in the spring of they found themselves again in gloucester he glanced at me i dont know that ive ever enjoyed a job so much as that taking it all round it was damn hard work but it suited me the life did he stopped talking and remained staring moodily into the fire i realized that the next episode had proved less prosperous and left him to himself for a bit the fire was dying down i got up and threw a few more lumps on and raked the ashes from the hearth i settled down into my chair again and lit a pipe it was about four oclock in the morning what happened next i asked i wanted to hear the end of this story if it meant sitting up all night he roused himself and smiled a little what happened next he said quietly was that mollie left me i wasnt prepared for that though on his own showing nothing was more probable i said something or other but he went on again without listening it was my fault of course wed never been able to have a proper home or the kids we wanted and one way or another id given her a rotten time of it we hadnt lived together for two years when that happened there was a cousin of hers a chap in the navy she was still a girl you know a good bit younger than me i went down to see her at her peoples place he was quiet for a minute and then he laughed i came away out of it as soon as i could there was a girl at gloucester who got me out of that mess worked in an office there she was a damn good sort an her name was mollie too i took her to the regent at cheltenham and we spent a night there and i sent my wife the bill and presently i got a notice that she was suing for divorce he sat brooding in his chair for a bit then staring into the fire immersed in memories but presently he roused himself again that killed my luck he said after that happened everything went wrong we started off again from gloucester to do the south coast and at every place we went we showed a loss at every ruddy place places like taunton and honiton where wed been really busy a couple of years before if we got a dozen of them into the air it was all we did people seemed to have got tired of it we carried on that way for a couple of months and then the directors got tired of it too i brought the machine up to croydon to be sold and that was the end of that he lit another cigarette i hadnt got a home to go to then he said he said no more than that but something in the way he said it revealed to me something of what that meant to him i know now that he was a man of little stamina in all his roving and uncertain life since the war he had always had a base somewhere to retire to to be alone with his wife and to regain his selfrespect i think his wife must have been a great backbone to him he wasnt the sort of man ever to make a name for himself alone and in the loss of his wife he had suffered a grave injury i had about fifty pounds in hand and while that lasted i hung about croydon touting for a job but there wasnt much doing there stavanger gave me a few odd taxi trips to do for him but nothing regular and then i went and did my reserve training and that carried me on for a few weeks by the end of the summer i was on the street he said it was either earn something or starve then i got a job in a garage as a fitter in acton two pounds ten a week he grinned unpleasantly at me temporary of course just till something else turned up i suppose thats how everyone looks at it when they go down the drain he told me about his life in the garage in little short cynical sentences from something that he said i gained a very clear impression that he had been drinking heavily ever since his wife left him a circumstance which probably accounted for his failure to get a flying job unlike the other failures to which he likened himself however he hated the garage enough to rouse himself to get out of ft possibly he gave up drinking i dont know about that at all events he told me that he began to look about for a chance to get out of the country he thought that if he could get out to australia he might be able to pick up a job in aviation again he said he wanted to get out of england he could have got a free passage to australia but he didnt know that and then a queer thing happened to him he used to take a packet of lunch to work with him from his fifthrate lodgings in harlesden and every other day he bought a copy of the daily mail to read in the lunch hour and there one day he read an article about the red menace he lit another cigarette bit of luck i got the paper that day he said i might have missed it god knows what would have happened then i was about through with fitters work it said in the article that the russians were building up the hell of an air service that was getting to be a menace to the whole of the rest of europe id heard somewhere or other that they were enlarging their service but id no idea till i read that bit in the paper that it was anything like that and then it went on to say how they were getting hold of british exofficers and sending them out to russia to train the red army in the latest tricks of aerial warfare and what a sin and a shame it was that englishmen should go and do that and how the government ought to stop it it went on like that for a couple of columns it said that they were paying as much as a thousand a year to these chaps he lifted his eyes from the fire and stared across at me in the firelight and the shadows of the room there was a momentary pause well he said at last so they were i stirred in my chair a little uneasily you went after it then like a knife so would you have done he read that at lunch time and he abandoned the garage and went straight off to the public baths in the high street and had a sixpenny hot bath then he went back to his room and got out the most respectable of hisold suits and found he had a visiting card left and he went straight off to the soviet embassy in chesham place he sat there in my armchair staring into the fire for a minute sod fingering the matchbox on his knee and it was all quite true he said id got away from all that muck just when i was beginning to think i never would the tone of relief in which he said that silenced me abruptly it silenced me then and it has done so ever since for him service with the soviet meant a deliverance from hell and a chance to get away and make a fresh start that was a great injury that his wife did him when she went it was a sort of polish jew who interviewed him he took lenden through it pretty thoroughly asking him the most searching questions about his war service he was particularly anxious to know whether he had had any experience on postwar singleseater fighting machines lenden had done half an hour on one of the earlier siskins and made some capital out of that for the rest he judged it better to speak the truth they sent him away with instructions to come back next day in the interval they must have looked up his record at the air ministry in some occult manner for they told him quite a lot about himself that he hadnt mentioned before then they gave him a pretty stiff medical examination and then they photographed him and finally they presented him with a contract drawn up and ready for him to sign eight hundred a year for a two years engagement with repatriation at the end of it he signed it on the spot and they gave him thirty pounds salary in advance you could have knocked me down with a feather he said but theyve treated me damn well all through i know theyre dirty dogs in other ways of course ive seen it a damn sight too much of it out there but theyve always given me a square deal and i dont mind saying so jews mostly all that ive had anything to do with and you mostly get a square deal in business from the jews in three days time they sent him his passport and some tickets he went out to russia indirectly travelling under an assumed name there was a place up on the hills behind ventimiglia he said the villa of an italian profiteer that seemed to serve as a centre for their vas activities in that part of europe and it was to this place that he was told to go he reported there in due course and the next day he was sent on through austria and poland into russia he bad a fair command of languages that he had picked up through flying about the continent and the travelling didnt present many difficulties from san remo he travelled on a forged american passport they sent him first to moscow he did a little flying there send in about ten days time he was sent on down to kieff where they were forming a squadron for instruction in advanced fighting were a pretty mixed crowd he said most of the instructors out there are germans but there were a couple of english there before me and one or two french and italians he shifted in his chair never hit it off very well with the other two english out there not my sort the germans arent a bad crowd though theres one chap there that i got to know pretty well a fellow called keumer who comes from nuremburg married with two or three children like the rest of us couldnt get anything to do in his own place used to fly a halberstadt in the war in our part of the line too hes a damn stout lad we live in pairs out there in little threeroomed huts and after a bit i went and shared his place he stared reflectively into the fire kieffs a good town he said it must have been better before the revolution but its a good spot still they put us out beyond pechersk with the aerodrome about a mile from the river not much to do away from the aerodrome you can go into the town they lend us a car whenever we want it and eat a heavy meal with the germans or you can go toying with amaryllis theres any amount of that to be had for the asking or you can go to the cinema and see douglas fairbanks and norma talmadge and mack sennett pretty well as soonas you cam see em io london with russian subtitles and eat crystallized fruits i tell you theres a glut of crystallized fruits in that town you cant get a proper cigarette for love or money but you can get those damn things pretty well chucked at you its a local industry or something he went on to talk for a long time about the type of machine that they had out there and the ability of the russian pilots he was of the opinion that the best pilots were the cossacks and he said that the russians were concentrating on trying to turn the best of their cavalry into fighting pilots he thought that that was sound and he had a very high opinion of their ability the trouble was that they were so illiterate everyone coming to that course was supposed to be able to read and write in actual fact their best pilots could do neither with any accuracy many of them had their horses with them there were horselines along one side of the aerodrome they fly into a fight like riding a horse no theory about it but theyre good theyve got a feel for the machine from the very first its a natural genius for the game and theyve got any amount of guts there was a very long silence then he sat there in that chair before the fire staring at the coals his hands outstretched upon the bolstered arms his long black hair falling down over his forehead in the halflight i thought that he was shivering a little as i watched him that went on till about six weeks ago he said at last i had a pretty good time of it out there taking it all round my pay comes regularly and i send a good bit of it back to england i arranged that before i signed the contract and they stuck to their side of it the money gets through all right and i like the work id have been there still but for this job i leaned forward and knocked my pipe out slowly against the palm of my hand over the grate i knew that we were coming to the root of it now this is for them i asked he didnt answer that at once theyve grown to trust me pretty well out there he said more than the others they came along one day about the middle of last month and made me an offer they wanted a long night flight or rather a series of night flights done outside wsa ss paf m tiiqgrjgbi russia they offered me a thousand pounds sterling with all expenses as a fee for doing it he paused irresolute whered you got to fly to i asked portsmouth he said laconically i had guessed something of the sort i suppose at all events it didnt come as much of a surprise he went on without looking at me im getting to the end of my time out there ive saved a bit of course about a couple of hundred pounds but thats not capital it wouldnt go any way if i was out of a job i tell you half a dozen times in the last three years id have been on my feet if i could have raked up a thousand or so dawson wanted me to go in with him in that show of his in penang you know i didnt know but i was silent and i couldnt and he sold out to the dutch as a going concern at three hundred per cent and then sam robertson gave me a chance of going in with him on the argentine survey and hes doing damn well i hear and id have liked to have been with sam again i cut him short why did they choose an englishman he laughed bar the english and the germans i dont suppose theres a pilot in russia that can lay a course properly night flying not to call a pilot they wanted a set of flashlight photographs taken from the air he said of portsmouth the scheme as they put it to him was worth the thousand as a pilots fee alone there was the devil of a lot oј risk about it he was to take a machine from kieff and fly by night across poland and germany to a place near hamburg where he was to land and wait during the day on the next night he was to fly to portsmouth do his job and return to hamburg before dawn the following night he was to return to kieff if anything went wrong he was to land and burn the machine and get away back to russia with the plates by land i stared at him incredulously i never heard of night flying like that i said its absolutely crazy do you mean to say you took it on he smiled a little bitterly i wanted that thousand you see im getting towards the end of my time out there yes i took it on i made damn sure about the money though i had it paid into my bank at croydon by the trade delegation and i wouldnt stir a finger till i had a letter from the manager about it in his own handwriting that made it as certain as it could be and when i got that i carried on with the preparations he began upon a long technical description of the machine and its equipment for this flight it was many years since i had had to do with aeroplanes and much of what he told me passed over my head i was afraid to put him off his tale by asking questions he said that they had several of those breguets in the school at kieff and he chose one of them for the job and he told me in a mass of technicalities that they had a propeller for that machine which at slow speeds was very quiet now half the noise of an aeroplane comes from the propeller virtually they had washed that out they set to work then and built a silencer for the exhaust of the engine they made the machine into a singleseater and fitted her with fuel tanks for about fifteen hours flight by the time theyd finished with her they had a machine which would fly from hamburg to portsmouth and back in a night and would keep in the air without losing height silently we did two machines like that he said one for a reserve in case anything happened to mine we fixed it that old keumer should fly the reserve one if it was necessary by the time wed done with mine shed fly at about eighty so quietly that you could hear the rustle of a map as you unfolded it in the cockpit it gave me a queer start the first time i heard that and they couldnt hear her on the ground at all when she was a couple of hundred metres up they had one or two rehearsals of the photography using a parachute flare and then they were ready what days this he asked suddenly thursday i said or i suppose its friday by this he thought for a little we were all ready last week i started for germany on sunday night the landingplace in germany was between lubeck and elmshorn a little to the north of hamburg the flight by the route he took was about seven hundred and fifty miles he took about six and threequartet hours to do it he left kieff with a full load of fuel at about five oclock in the afternoon mideurope time and set a compass course for the baltic it was a very dark night and the ground was covered with snow he said that it was very cold he flew most of the way at about five thousand feet the breguet wasnt a silent machine at her cruising speed by any means and he didnt want to wake the poles up down below between kieff and danzig he didnt check his course at all he just sat there watching his compass and trying to fight the miseries of cold and when he had been in the air for four hours he came down to about a couple of hundred feet to see where he was he saw the lights of a village on the snow and he nearly hit a hill in trying to get down lower to see ae sort of country he was over upon that he went up again and carried on for another twenty minutes at the end of that time he found that he was over sea he thought it out and came to the conclusion that he must be to the east of his course since there was a westerly wind blowing and he had seen no sign of danzig on the coast accordingly he swung round and set a course southwest by south to hit the coast again and in a few minutes he had picked up the lighthouse at putzig that gave him his position and he set to flying along the coast towards rigged about a hundred and twenty miles farther on there was a stiffish wind against him and that leg of the course took him an hour and a quarter the darkness and the intense cold together with the strain were making him sleepy he had several drinks out of his flask he said and presently he picked up a lighthouse on rigged after that he was pretty well home he passed over about looking for his russians had secured a great stood in the middle of that marshy that it was all shut up except for three rooms that they lived in he said he didnt ask many questions about the place anyway he said theyd done their part of it all right the arrangement was that theyd have the devil of a great bonfire lighted halfway between elmshorn and lubeck and three miles south of that id find the landing lights laid out on the ground for me to land by inconspicuouslike well i picked up the bonfire all right theyd given a beano to some village there and supplied the wood and the drink and everything it was a good fire that the flames must have been getting on for fifty feet high at times i saw it twenty miles away and gave it a pretty good berth it was easy then i circled round a bit and found the landing and put the breguet down on to the grass along the line of lights he said that it had been a very cold flight living in england you dont know what its like i was all sort of cramped and stiffened in the one position i tried to get out of the machine when she stopped but i had to sit there till they came and climbed up on to the fuselage to help me out ive never been like that before the usual crowd of jew boys but they were damn good to me that night they had hot soup all ready and a fire and as soon as i was thawed out a bit and had a quart or so of soup inside me i fell asleep where i was pretty well standing up he slept till noon the next day and spent the afternoon with a mechanic overhauling the machine for the flight to portsmouth that was monday afternoon he said i started at about six in the evening with fifteen hours fuel on board that flight should take about eleven hours for the return journey allowing a bit for head winds and for about a quarter of an hour over portsmouth he took a compass course over holland passing pretty well inland he said he was afraid of getting mixed up with the zuyder zee he ostend and took a departure fr flying at about three thousand feet island at about halfpast eleven he picked lighthouse first and from there he followed straight along in through spithead he took up the poker absently and scraped a little of the ash from the bars of the grate the fire was glowing very red into his face i throttled down at the nab he said and then we went creeping in doing about eighty and so quiet that i might have heard my watch ticking if id put it to my ear i had the parachute flare all ready with a little stick to poke it down the tube with it was the entrance to the harbour that i had to take the narrow part my pipe was out but i was afraid to interrupt his narrative by stirring to relight it it was easy enough the lights from the town the streetlamps showed on both sides of the water so that the entrance looked like a great streak of black between the lights i cruised round a bit before i set off the flare and dropped off a little height so that i finished up at about two thousand five hundred feet eight hundred metres was the height that wed fixed for the focus of the camera you see he paused i could see that there was something funny going on before i set off the flare he said there was a string of green lights stretching right across the entrance from side to side near the mouth like a barrier to stop vessels coming in and about half a mile inside from that there was a sort of faint glow in the middle of the harbour like a couple of floodlights running a bit dim you couldnt see anything from the air but just that there was light there in the middle of the water not like the lights of a ship either more like a quay he laid down the poker and glanced across at me well i was all ready i went over to the gosport side to start the fun it was a westerly wind you see and i wanted to place the flare so that it would drift over the target i turned her beyond the town and came back again down wind towards the entrance and when the target bore about thirty degrees from the vertical with me i made contact and shoved the flare down through tube it burst about thirty feet below me and i had time for a quick glance round before the sights came on he relapsed into a long silence i knew that having got so far he would finish the story in his own time and i left him to think it over looking back upon it now i think he may have been reluctant to tell what he had seen to any living person i think that may have been one of the reasons for his pause was there much going on i asked at last he raised his head and eyed me steadily i dont know what it was he said and thats the truth ive never seen anything like it before there was some damn great thing out there in the middle of the harbour it wasnt a ship and it wasnt a barge i dont know what it was there were three or four vessels standing by it and there was a sort of thick black line of something running from it to the gosport shore thats what i saw its all i had time to see because the sights began to bear and i got busy it stood out pretty well as clear as daylight the shadows all black and sharp that flare was a corker of a thing he flung his halfsmoked cigarette into the fire and lit another it burnt for about thirty seconds i flew straight over the target and got in three good shots one after the other that would join up to make a long strip photograph you see when the sights ceased to bear i chucked her round ia a quick turn and made another run over the target i went slower over the ground that time because i was flying against the wind i got in five shots on that run and i passed the flare about halfway a little below me gad to starboard i swung her round again at the end of that run and got in two more shots as i headed east over the thing in the middle of the second one the light went out i tell you it was a fine flare that there wasnt even a red glow to show where it had been and make them smell a rat it just flicked clean out into the darkness he was heading east when that happened he didnt linger over portsmouth but went straight on ahead and back the way he came he kept his machine flying slowly and quietly till he was well out at sea past the nab then opened up his engine and made straight along the coast for dover i got up from my chair and crossed to the back of the room the daily papers generally lie about there for a week or so before they disappear and i had no difficulty in finding the one i wanted that passage was there as i remembered it fireball at portsmouth meteorologists today are eagerly discussing the appearance of a large fireball or meteor over portsmouth on monday night according to eyewitnesses the phenomenon made its appearance at about halfpast eleven and lasted for a period variously estimated as from forty seconds to a minute the body materialised at a comparatively low height and according to one statement was accompanied by a low rumbling noise the streets of the city and the harbour were brilliantly illuminated for a few moments during the passage of the phenomenon which moved slowly in an easterly direction no damage is reported i showed it to lenden he read it through and smiled you got back all right then i asked he was staring into the fire and shivering a little yes i got back he said slowly i landed at about four oclock it was twice as long a flight as the one from kieff but i didnt feel it half so much i was tired of course but nothing beyond the ordinary it hadnt been so cold for one thing as soon as he landed they set about pegging down the machine for the night and draining the radiator then they wentto get the plates from the camera he said that the plates for that camera were held in two chargers they were all in one box to start with and as you exposed each plate it slid over to the other box automatically leaving a fresh plate all ready over the lens they went to take off the box of exposed plates it didnt come away freely and when they finally got it off there was a crack and a tinkle of glass he glanced at me the first plate had jammed he said quietly it was the tripping gear they hadnt been passing the lens at all id taken all the ten exposures on the one plate id done it all and flown all that way for nothing it was bad luck that from his point of view it meant that the flight all had to be done again he told me that he was forced to leave it for a day or two hed done two long night flights on two successive nights and he wasnt fit to do another one straight off he had to have some rest he said that he was getting jumpy and feverish with the exposure he talked it over with the jews and they made it thursday night for the second shot the interval he spent mostly in bed there was another thing he said i knew thered be some risk about the second trip i mean to say whatever it is thats going on there its pretty secret one cant go on letting off fireballs over portsmouth indefinitely and think they wont tumble to the game and its a protected area you know theyve got every right to shoot you down if you go monkeying about over that sort of place it had been all right the first time id taken them by surprise but i knew it wasnt going to be so easy the second time he paused and by god it wasnt he shivered violently and drew up closer to the fire he flew over in exactly the same way he found the same subdued light in the middle of the entrance but the thing had moved nearer to the gosport shore and as he drew closer he saw one thing that scared him stiff and put the wind up him properly they had the landinglights out on gosport aerodrome he sat there very still staring at the glowing embers of the fire i could see that i was in for it then he said very quietly and from our own people i knew that as soon as i let off my flare itd be like poking a stick into a wasps nest i knew thered be machines coming up from the aerodrome after me and that in a few minutes i might have something like a gamecock hanging on behind me and then id have to land or be shot down he was silent for a minute the worst part of it what put the wind up me most he was speaking so quietly that i could hardly hear what he said was that theyd be our own people somebody like dick scott or poddy armstrong that id played pills with at the royal aero club sitting there in the gamecock pooping off tracer bullets at me and thinking he was doing a damn good job he pulled himself together and lit another cigarette he was still shivering a bit i wondered if he had taken ill he said that the job went through almost exactly as it had before he set his flare off on the gosport side of the harbour and began taking photographs as he went east as he turned the machine at the end of that run he saw the first of the green lights come up they were setting off green rockets from gosport in groups of three at a time it was the signal to land at once the things rose to a height of about a thousand feet and burst in a duster of green stars they were shooting them up in groups of three at intervals of about ten seconds lenden paid no attention to them but he got in five photographs on his way west over the target he took nine exposures in all and then swung the machine round and went straight out to sea i didnt dare to open out my engine the breguet can do about a hundred and sixty miles an hour but to do that youve got to make a noise i kept her throttled down and silent and went drifting out towards the island doing about eighty i turned in my seat as i went and had a good look at the aerodrome behind me they had stopped sending up the rockets and as i watched i distinctly saw a machine sweep across the aerodrome in front of the landing lights as she took off i knew then were after me he sat playing with the poker for a bit well he said they didnt find me they didnt get their searchlights going fast enough by the time the first of those came up he was miles away right out to sea above spithead he carried on like that till he was somewhere off st helens then he thought that his best course was to put on speed and get dear so he switched on the little shaded light over his instruments and with an eye wandering over the dials thrust forward the throttle he saw the needle of the oil gauge go leaping up till it jammed at the limit of the dial he glanced at me i had barely appreciated the significance of that it was so long since i had flown its rotten when a thing like that happens he said quietly at night and over strange country and i was right out to sea mind you about five miles from land i didnt see the fun in coming down in the water if my engine was going to pack up and so i turned towards the coast somewhere by selsey and then quite suddenly the gauge flicked down to zero and oil began to come spraying down the fuselage from the engine coating the wind screen and blowing in my face warm oil all black and sticky in the darkness i knew that i was in for it then he said and it was all dark below pitch dark with only a little white surf to show the line of the beaches no hope of being able to pick out a field to land in and i knew that very soon the engine would pack up he was shivering again i threw a lump or two of coal on the fire and he crouched a little closer towards it he said he made for the downs he knew that part of the country fairly well from flying over it and he knew that he could pull off a forced landing on the top of the downs without hurting himself he didnt care a damn what happened to the machine so long as he could get down uninjured with the plates his orders were that in ich a case the machine was to be burnt i went up between chichester and arundel and as i went he said i was climbing climbing for all i was fit to get a bit of height while the engine lasted i got her up to five thousand feet or so a few miles inland from the coast i knew it was all open grass land in front of me then and every chance of a decent landing i thought i might want the engine again at the last minute to pull me clear of a tree or a house so i shut off before she seized up for good and put the machine on the glide down to land and then as luck would have it the moon came out for a couple of minutes and showed me the lie of the country the only time id seen the moon since i left kieff it was easy then i set off a wingtip flare at about fifty feet and landed where you saw his voice died into the silence he had come to the end of his story it seemed and now he was waiting for me to say something i glanced uneasily about the room in search of inspiration and saw the black tin case he had brought from the machine lying beside his chair i would have picked it up but he was before me these are the photographs i asked he nodded turning the box over and over in his hands i thought about it for a minute why didnt you burn the machine grouching towards the fire he glanced up at me and grinned i hadnt got a match i suppose i looked doubtful he said that he had made a little pile of papers in the cockpit and soaked them with petrol and then he went through his pockets and found he had one match just the one hehadnt thought about bringing proper incendiary materials with him he struck the head off that match at the first go and there he was he tried to get a spark out of the lighting system for a time but failed to ignite his papers then he tried to get one of the flares off the wing and presently he had to give that up for lack of tools then it came on to rain in buckets he said i was fed up with it by then and left her that explained why he had not picketed the machine lenden crouched a little closer to the fire and began shivering again that drew my attention youve got a chill i said he sat back from the fire a little and stopped shivering its nothing he replied ive had it for some days i eyed him thoughtfully for a minute and wondered if he was going to be ill he had flushed up in the last hour or so fever he nodded got it when i was out with sam robertson on the patuca he said i never give it much heed it was the flight from kieff that started it this time ive had it intermittently since then off and on you know ill take some quinine if youve got any i went into my bedroom and returned with a bottle of tablets he read the label counted out about half the bottle into the palm of his hand and swallowed them with the help of a glass of water from the table it was getting towards dawn outside the lawns of the garden were beginning to show grey through the uncurtained window i could see the outline of a flower bed and a shadowy tree i remained standing on the fender there before the fire and staring down at him i didnt know what to do he was still handling that flat box of plates i stood there in perplexity for a bit and at last what are you going to do with those i asked bluntly lenden had begun to shiver again he seemed not to have heard my question but sat there crouching down over the fire he had an odd flushed look about him i remember his hair was ruffled and hanging down over his forehead giving him a worn and dissipated appearance i thought for a little are you on your way back to russia i asked presently i repeated the question he didnt take his eyes from the fire god knows he said morosely i dont it was no use thinking of going to bed now it was getting on for halfpast five and the daylight was growing fast outside the window i stood there on the fender studying him for a bit longer and then i crossed the room and sat down at the piano it was a baby grand that i had bought a year or so before and i was still paying for it that piano stands beside me now it had a pleasant dean tone with little volume to it most suitable to the sort of room that i can afford i had done that before and i have done it since ive always lived a pretty healthy life to lose a nights sleep means very little to me if i may sit quietly at the piano for an hour at the beginning of the new day i slid on to the stool that morning dropped my fingers on to the keys and began upon the overture to my play it goes gently that overture and in my hands of course it plays itself i let it ripple on through the various themes absently polishing it a bit as i went now and again i glanced across to lenden he was still sitting exactly as i had left him crouching over the fire his hair hanging down untidily over his forehead fingering that infernal box and shivering it was pretty evident that he was going to be ill and that wasnt surprising he had been soaked to the skin when i met him on the road and i hadnt thought of offering him a change of clothes he had dried before the fire i finished the overture and began upon the plot the forest scenes come first in the play i dont suppose i shall ever really be satisfied with those forest scenes i have polished and refined them out of all recognition continually i dont know how long i sat over them then but i was startled by lendens voice whats that youre playing i dropped my hands from the piano and swung round on the stool he had got up and was standing on the fender with his back to the fire sorry i said id forgotten about you he was staring at me most intently across the room i remember you now he said slowly id forgotten all about you except that there was a man of your name in the squadron but i remember you now quite well you used to fly the machine with the three red stars on the fuselage and you used to play for us in the mess when we were tired of the gramophone i nodded that was my machine ive got a photograph of her somewhere i remember you now he repeated whats that you were playing then i turned again to the piano its a play for the cinema i said an opera if you like for the films i dropped my fingers on to the keys again and replayed the opening to the forest scene it goes very pleasantly that bit i knew that he was standing there by the fire and watching me as i faced the rosewood of the instrument and i knew that i was holding his attention whether he knew anything about music didnt matter with that thing i wrote it for the people who didnt i came to the end of that theme i had forgotten all about aeroplanes by then whats it all about he asked curiously i touched a few chords of the next theme before replying and then paused its about a kings daughter i said who went walking in the forest and got chased by a bear by the hell of a bear you can do that sort of thing on the pictures you know you cant go and put on a scene of a bear chasing a girl all round the stage at covent garden not so that youd see the princess all of a muck sweat but you can do it on the films i began to play the first passages of the next theme a little absently for one thing she wouldnt be able to sing if you chased her properly i said not for an hour or two anyway the storys just that she went into the forest alone because she wanted to get away from the court and from her women and to be alone spring o the year you know you can do the court all right on the films indicate it fourteenth century with those tall hats with a veil hanging down from them and a tall misty castle lenden had moved closer to the piano as i talked my fingers were running automatically through the preliminary forest passages she went out after the flowers and got chased by a bear that came sort of wuffling out of a thicket at her and frightened her very much he had come quite close i finished that passage looked up and grinned at him this is the bear i thought for a minute and began upon the bear theme it starts with the bear rooting and snuffling in the undergrowth with a second motif of the princess coming closer among the flowers because she wanted to be alone that motif starts faint and grows and then theres a bit of blood and thunder when the bear comes out into the open that merges into a regular nightmare bit of music that i take at racing speed its quite a simple theme it starts fairly quietly shes a good way ahead of the bear then as the chase goes on through the trees of the wood that theme gets louder and faster more monstrous more uncouth on the film one can work that up well of course the whole thing lasts for nearly five minutes of tense panic the trees of the forest get larger and the bear himself one makes larger and larger more monstrous as he gets closer its a good bit of writing that though i say it myself i put all i knew into it and stopped abruptly at the woodman i dropped my hands from the keys and turned to lenden thats the bear i said by god he muttered i dont wonder she got the wind up i think it may have been his simplicity that roused me to a sense of his position and made me swing round suddenly upon my stool see here i said what about you lenden dyou want to stay here you can if you like you know theres a bedroom in there and youre welcome to it for as long as you want it or are you going on up to town he shifted his position uneasily and avoided my eyes i dont quite know what to do he said uncertainly ive got these ruddy plates to get rid of his eyes when i saw them were halfclosed and very bright he had flushed up and altogether he looked a pretty sick man im no doctor but i got up and took his wrist his pulse seemed to be overrevving badly and he was very hot i was morally certain that if he went travelling alone hed end his journey in a london hospital and i said as much i know he pressed both hands to his forehead for a moment and passed them back over his hair its this infernal fever and getting wet im in for a searcher this time i met his eyes and held them for a moment youd better get to bed i said theres nobody comes to this house but me and the servants ill say that i brought you back with me from winchester i doubt if he heard what i said it always shakes me when i get a bout like this he muttered it was different when mollie was there he was shivering again lie up here for a day or two till youre fit i suggested then you can go on to town when you like you cant go travelling like this id ha been all right if id got tight last night he said i knew this was coming i went through into the spare bedroom there was a greyness over everything by now in the sittingroom the lamps were burning yellow in the growing morning light i found sheets and blankets under the coverlet and made up the bed for him when that was done i went back to the sittingroom he was still turning that black box over and over in his hands uncertainly i filled a kettle and put it on the fire to boil rooms ready when you are i said youd better go to bed and stay there ill get you a hotwater bottle soon as this boils its damn good of you he muttered he went through into the bedroom and began to undress presently the kettle boiled i took the bottle in to him and found him in bed he was very grateful in an inarticulate sort of way i cut him short went out of the room and left him to go to sleep back in the sittingroom i stood for a minute looking at myself in the glass over the mantelpiece i cant say it was a pretty sight i was still in evening kit but my tie had worked up towards one ear and my trousers were smeared with mud from the down the room was littered and squalid in the grey light the electric lights unwholesome and the remains of supper on the table an offence only the white keys and rosewood of the piano by the window appeared clean in that room i went into my bedroom undressed and had a bath that pulled me round a bit half an hour later when i had shaved dressed and flung open the window in the sittingroom i was more or less myself again it was a cloudless morning over the kitchen garden the sun was rising through the mists left by the rain and in the stable eaves the birds were beginning softly like a bit of grieg i went to the door of my house and looked out over the yard nobody was stirring yet nor would be for half an hour to come unless some underhousemaid in the mansion i had a job of work to do before breakfast but i needed the help of one or two labourers for it and i knew that it was no good going out to look for them for a bit i shut the door and went back to the sittingroom and kicked the dying fire together and stood over it for a little and then since there was nothing else to do i sat down again at the piano the morning was coming up all sunny and bright it must have been chilly at the piano for the window was open beside me but i didnt seem to notice it i had arranged that corner of the garden to have a fine show of daffodils that spring it was a wild part where the family didnt come much i could see them just beginning to poke up through the grass there were primroses there buckets of them and a few snowdrops i sat there looking at them for a bit halfasleep through the trees in winter you can see the grey whaleback of the down as it sweeps up above the house and the village i was sick of my own work i strummed a bar or two and played chopin for a little till i grew tired of him i sat there for a bit then and thought id better get out into the yard and start up my car i had that aeroplane to hide but i sat there for a little longer before moving and presently i found myself rippling through the spring song it was the cold that started me off on it i suppose that and the flowers i must have become engrossed in it again i know i ran through it several times quite softly rippling through it and wondering if i should ever write anything myself onetenth so good it should be played lightly that thing very lightly and a little staccato i dont know for how long i went on playing it may have been for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour till some slight sound made me turn my head lenden was standing in the doorway in my pyjamas his hand resting on the jamb to steady him his face dead white i dropped my hands from the keys better get along back to bed i said youve got the hell of a temperature he moistened his lips for christs sake stop playing that infernal thing i cant stick it any longer i stared at him puzzled why not whats the matter he avoided my eyes i thought you might be doing it on purpose he said uncertainly if you werent the way you went on and on i smiled got up from the piano and crossed the room to him as for you i said youre bats thats whats the matter with you youre imagining things im going out now to hide that aeroplane of yours where it wont be seen from the road before anyone else gets to know about it youre going to go back to bed and go to sleep pretty damn quick he turned from the door all right he said wearily ill have some breakfast sent over for you about ten oclock bit of fish or something i paused and dont be a ruddy fool two i went out into the yard to start up the car it was very fresh and cold outside i left the engine to run warm while i went back into the house for a coat then i got going on the road for the downs the wind and the rain of the night had gone completely and left only a thin mist about the hedges in the rising sun i passed through the main street of under and let the car rip along the road for leventer i saw the machine when i was a mile away there she was stuck right up on top of the down insecurely tethered and swaying a little in the light wind she was a landmark for miles around i stopped the car near to where i had picked up lenden and began to walk across the down towards her hoping most earnestly that no one else had passed that way since dawn it wasnt very likely there was a barn in the hollow of the down below the machine about half a mile distant from her in the opposite direction to the road i passed her without stopping and went on down the hill i thought it might be possible to get her down the slopes and tether her behind the barn she would be out of sight of the road there and as secret as it was possible to make her short of dismantling her altogether i realized as i walked that it might come to that in time if she was to be disposed of secretly the only way would be to take her to bits and burn her piecemeal the slopes were easy enough on the way down to the barn there would be no difficulty about getting her down the hill into seclusion if ever she were needed again it would even be possible to taxi her up the hill again under her own power till level ground was reached for her to take off at that time i didnt think that there was the least chance of that ever happening but there was very little doubt that it could be done if necessary i had a bit of luck then spadden the farmer came out of the barn as i approached a grizzled uncommunicative man of fiftyodd he had a couple of sheep in there with bad feet he told me he had had the vet out to them from leventer the day before in a terrible fright that it was footandmouth the vet it seemed had laughed heartily given him a poultice drunk a stoup of ale and departed spadden told me all this as he greeted me beside the barn and as he was showing me the beasts he was a good sort was spadden hed always given me a square deal and i knew he wouldnt talk i put it to him bluntly been up on the down this morning i inquired he hadnt well ive got an aeroplane up there he nodded slowly nasty dangerous things he said at last you dont want to go messing about with them no more thought youd had your fill in the war i laughed its nothing to do with me ive not been flying it but i know the pilot hes an old friend of mine he landed here late last night hes had to go to london in a hurry i said id look after it for him and see that it was picketed down somewhere in shelter from the wind he said he reckoned to leave it here a week it was a thin tale aye said spadden phlegmatically wherell we put it i thanked god for him bring it down into the hollow here i said and picket it under the lee of the barn its quiet enough down here aye he said again its quiet down here he stared around never a great wind down here if you put it here the sheepll be worrying it they cant hurt it reckon theyll rub let em i said there was very little chance i thought that anyone would ever want to fly it again he went off and fetched one of his labourers and then we went trudging up to the top of the down there we cut loose the lashings that held her lifted the tail shoulderhigh and began to wheel her down to the barn it was all downhill or wed never have got her there we must have put her down a dozen times for a spell she was a big machine that breguet and a heavy one to handle on the ground i know that by the time we got her down to the barn i for one was wishing most heartily that id never set eyes on her there was everything we needed in that barn right on the spot we drove stakes into the ground beneath the wingtips with a wooden mallet and lashed her to them loosely to enable her to ride a little in the wind we lashed sacking down over the engine the propeller and the cockpit i made a proper job of the controls by the time id done with her she was a fixture and fit to lie out there for a winter without taking any great harm apart from the sheep that is i made a rough examination of her before i left there was an oil pipe broken in the engine mounting a bit of rubber piping that connected the oil tank to the engine perhaps an inch in diameter frayed and burst there was a great slaver of oil all about that had come from this pipe that was the trouble that had brought him down something must have made the pipe burst i supposed some stoppage in the circuit but what it was i did not know i left her then spadden said hed keep an eye on her and see that she didnt suffer too much from the sheep i took the occasion to urge him not to talk about her but there was little need for that he didnt want a lot of sightseers wandering about all over his land i went back to under for breakfast well satisfied with myself the machine couldnt be seen from the road and i had left her in as great concealment as could be contrived in england it is no easy matter to hide an aeroplane it is a most conspicuous thing and every village constable seems to have an official interest in it on all occasions i drove back to the hall put my car in the coach house and went across to my own place they had made my bed and had begun to lay the table for breakfast i looked into my spare room lenden was asleep in bed flushed and breathing heavily i closed the door softly and went out i crossed the yard and went to the gunroom in the mansion the morning papers generally tarry a while there on their way to the breakfast table whenever i want to know any particular item of news in a hurry i go and look through them there before breakfast i spread them out upon the gunroom table that morning and glanced quickly through the lot halfhoping to find a second paragraph about fireballs over portsmouth i found nothing at all i gave it up at last rang the bell and sent for sanders the butler he came in due course greyheaded lean and infinitely well bred morning sanders i said i brought a gentleman back with me from winchester last night and stuck him in my spare room i expect the maid told you he inclined his head gravely she did sir well said i i think hes going to be ill he looked concerned i am very sorry to hear that sir yes so am i as a matter of fact i dont think its anything very bad touch of malaria i should think hes not long back from the east shivering fits and a temperature he took enough quinine to kill a dog when we got in last night and went off to bed ive just looked in on him now hes asleep i paused and thought for a minute ive got to go to pithurst for a sale today i cant miss that ill be out to lunch hell probably stay in bed all day i should think will you see mrs richards about it and get him some lunch taken over something pretty light bit of fish or something ill see if theres anything he wants before i go and ill be back about teatime very good sir he might fancy a grapefruit with the fever i nodded good scheme you might send one over m the middle of the morning if hes awake he went away and i turned again to the papers relations with russia were more strained than they had been since the time of the general strike the mail in particular was very insistent on the subject the times was frankly concerned over the reception of our note i spread it out upon the gunroom table and became immersed in the leading article i dont generally read die leaders in the times theyre not much in my line ive never taken much stock of politics or legislation or the affairs of state but that day it was different i wanted to find out exactly how matters stood and as i sat there that morning on the edge of the gunroom table in the sunlight reading that leading article i realized that things had gone further in the direction of a breach with russia than i had dreamed lenden was awake when i got back to the house i looked in at the door of his room for a moment before breakfast he was very hot and restless in bed he remarked thickly that he had a ruddy mouth like the bottom of the parrots cage he said there wasnt anything that he wanted better stay where you are for the present then i replied and retired to my bacon and eggs i looked in on him again before i went out he was feeling very thick and rotten and was evidently in for a pretty sharp bout of fever i sat chatting with him for a bit and then rang up the housekeeper and asked her to send over a thermometer he had a temperature of about a hundred and two in ordinary circumstances id have sent for a doctor at that point you cant afford to go messing about with a temperature like that lenden wouldnt hear of it he said he knew what had to be done lie in bed and take quinine and neat brandy till it went off that seemed very reasonable to me in any ease it was the treatment that had cured this thing before it might have been rather difficult to explain him to the doctor too i didnt want his presence in under advertised more than necessary until i knew what he was going to do he didnt want anything to eat i made him comfortable and went over and had a chat with mrs richards the housekeeper i wasnt very happy about having him in a strange house in that condition and told her to send over someone every couple of hours or so to see that he was all right more than that i couldnt do i left him some books and a decanter of brandy got out my car and went off to my office in under my office is in the main street of the town about a hundred yards from the market i rent a couple of rooms there for the business in the same building as the rural district council and the waterworks company i had a good bit to do that morning i remember because it was getting on towards quarter day however at about halfpast eleven i left my clerk to cope with the rest of it and got going on the road for pithurst i had to go there was a chap there whod made a real effort to get a pedigree herd of shorthorns together arner was keen on all pedigree stock and wed helped him quite a lot this chap had put every bean hed got into this herd and borrowed a lot he hadnt and then died it really was rather important that i should be there to watch the sale i had a long chat with arner about it a couple of days before we fixed it that if things began to go badly i was to start running the price up on one or two of the young bulls if they came to us by the hammer we could ship them out to las plantas and get a good bit of our money back that way as it happened that wasnt necessary there was a fellow there whod come up from devon for the sale and really wanted the whole lot i believe or at any rate the heifers and young bulls im not sure that if id gone to him privately he wouldnt have made an offer for the whole issue as it stood still wed arranged an auction and there were a good many of the local people interested this devon chap would have had it all his own way in spite of that if i hadnt been there time after time i ran him up to a decent price for the beast when the locals had dropped out and then left him to it as things turned out he paid a pretty fair average price for what he had and by the time wed finished he was ready to see me dead the locals took what was left not a bad sale and i went home at the end feeling that id done a pretty good days work it was about five oclock when i moved off i went by the under road because i wanted to drop in at the office to sign my letters i stayed there for a quarter of an hour or so and then drove back to the hall now under hall lies about two and a half miles from the town on the other side of the rother you come out of the town past the station and go on for about a mile or so till you come to a humpy stone bridge across the river under hall is about a mile farther on from that i came swinging along that road in the morris thinking no evil and pulled up with a squeal of brakes as i came upon the bridge sheila darle was there arners niece sitting on the stone parapet in one of the triangular recesses she hadnt got a hat on and i can remember that the wind was ruffling her short brown hair that meant that shed just strolled down from the hall she was sitting there on the bridge waiting for someone and i had a feeling when i saw her that probably she was waiting for me i pulled up beside her good evening miss darle i remarked well it was it had been a fresh windy sort of day now in the evening the wind had dropped the clouds had turned white and the sky deep blue the sun was setting behind the down she slid down from the parapet and came and leaned her arms upon the hood on the opposite side of the car to me good evening mr moran she said somewhere behind her there was a thrush the first id heard that year can i give you a lift back i asked im going straight home she shook her head absently its a nice evening for walking i wanted the walk she glanced up at me mr moran she said whos that youve got in your house there was no point in wasting petrol i leaned forward to stop the engine and took my time over answering that question a chap i used to know in the flying corps i replied and stared her down i met him in winchester and brought him back with me last night his names lenden maurice lenden she smiled at me across the car maurice lenden she observed now thats about the only thing i didnt know about him i eyed her thoughtfully for a minute i see i said at last youve been doing a bit of lady investigating she nodded i had known sheila darle since first i came to under when i came here she was still at school she used to spend her summer holidays with her uncle at the hall one day that summer she went to london and had her hair bobbed in the childrens department at harrods and came back looking about ten years older fired by that on the same evening she took her uncles little talbot twoseater that we kept for running in and out of town and proclaimed her intention of driving it drive it she did too very neatly and accurately into the gatepost of the stableyard and the dogkennel that was my first acquaintance with sheila darle when she came to me very nearly in tears about it and wanted to know what she was to do i was younger then than i am now but not so young as to miss the implication that the damaged wing and radiator should be repaired before lord arner came back from town i got it done in time but i made her go and tell him about it that set the keynote to our relations since those days i had sent off a couple of men with a horse to bring her car in about once every six months sometimes it was too bad for that and then we had to get the garage to go and fetch it in i knew she wouldnt let me down in this youve been talking to him i asked she shook her head hes been talking but not to me hes very ill i wrinkled my brows hes got a touch of fever i said he took a cold a few days ago and made it worse last night but he should be all right dyou mean hes off his head she nodded him i reached out and put my hand to the starter id better get along back to him she didnt move from her position leaning against the car hes all right now she said he was sleeping quite nicely when i came out and mrs richards is in the sittingroom but you shouldnt have left him like that you gave mrs richards a great fright im sorry about that i said i didnt think he was going to be off his head he gets this thing whenever he takes a bad chill malaria or something he picked it up out in honduras she didnt make any reply to that so that there was silence for a bit then she looked up suddenly is he an airman she inquired i nodded he was in my squadron in the war he became a professional pilot after that and now she said casually hes just come back from russia i glanced down at the river it runs pretty fast over pebbles beneath that bridge and with a rippling sound i have heard that there are grayling in it and i remember wondering then if that were true and presently i glanced at her again youd better tell me about it i said quietly she laughed theres nothing much to tell only its so funny mrs richards sent a maid over to him in the middle of the morning with a grapefruit and some barley water because she thought hed like it and the girl came back and said she couldnt make him understand anything but he was talking to himself all the time mrs richards thought youd got a looney over there and went over herself and then she came and fetched me i see i muttered thats how it was did you send for aromatize the local doctor she shook her head i didnt think it was necessary unless he got worse you see youd told them that hed got malaria and that hed have to lie up for a bit you hadnt told them that he was going to be off his head though no we just took it in turns to sit with him that was kind of you i said not a bit hes a nice man i knew what she meant by that theres no better way to get to know a mans character than to get him tight and see how he talks then and i suppose delirium is much the same she leaned both arms upon the hood of the car and looked straight at me he was saying such funny things she remarked i nodded ruefully i expect he was what did he say she considered for a minute it was all so mixed up she said he seemed to be talking most of the time about a long night flight that he had made in the dark in the cold she glanced at me do you know where that was i shook my head it was over snowy country and it was very cold he was frozen in his seat so stiff that he couldnt move and his head kept dropping forward with the sleepiness of it and to keep himself awake he raised his goggles and the cold bit his face and made his eyes water and the tears froze on his cheeks and he was most terribly frightened she paused thats one of them he gets a sort oј cold fit every now and again and whenever he gets that he comes back to talking about that cold flight he shivers poor old soul i remarked what else did he say he was talking a lot about his wife but i dont want to repeat that and there wasnt anything that really mattered except to them all right what else it was very quiet by the river he was talking about a man called poddy armstrong that he used to meet at the royal aero club it was rather horrid that wheres the royal aero club mr moran its a london club i said in clifford street i glanced at her i suppose youre going to tell me that poddy armstrong was chasing him in another machine and trying to shoot him down in the dark she stared at me how did you know why i said simply he told me why was poddy armstrong going to shoot at him i took a long time over answering that question perhaps theyd had a quarrel i suggested in the end she was about to say something to that but checked herself i knew that i had hurt her in the end she smiled at me i know its not my business she said but one cant help being curious neither yours nor mine i said its his own affair hes been in a good bit of trouble lately one way and another he told me some of it last night when we didnt go to bed did he say any more she considered for a little no only one funny thing happened he woke up at about three oclock and we gave him a drink of barley water he was quieter then and he seemed so hot we thought itd be a good thing he asked for you and i said that you were away but youd be back presently and then he said a funny thing she eyed me steadily he said you played the spring song at him is that all he said thats all it didnt seem to make sense he just rolled over and went to sleep when wed given him his drink i think hes sleeping still i sat there staring at the last gleams of sunshine upon the radiator thermometer of my car it wanted polishing did you she inquired i turned to her i dont play at people i replied i play because i want to lendens a sick man and sick men have fancies you mustnt pay any attention to them the sun was just disappearing behind the down in the fading light the soft brown hair clustered about her neck was all streaked and shot with gold i had loved her for two years and i had given up being hurt by things like that there was silence for a moment then i pulled my gauntlets farther on to my hands leaned over and slipped the catch of the door it swung open by its own weight would you care for a lift home i said t must get back she got in without a word and i started off for the hall that was a silent drive it wasnt till i had driven into the yard and stopped the engine of the car in the coachhouse that we spoke again of course i said as the engine came to rest hes a man whos had a pretty rough time of it you can see that for yourself i paused and chose my words he may even have got himself into trouble if that were so it would be a pity to remember anything that he may have said in fever when he wasnt himself she glanced up at me in surprise but he didnt say anything that he need be ashamed of rather the opposite no but he may have said things that hed rather not have talked about in fact i said he did there was a long silence after that finally she stirred and got out of the car i knew it was something like that of course she said and sighed its a pity because hes a nice man she turned away all right mr moran ill not give him away and ill see mrs richards she left the coachhouse and went walking across the yard towards the mansion i sat there in the car staring after her for a little wondering how much she knew lenden was asleep when i got back to my house and a maid was sitting in the adjoining room i sent her back to the mansion and went in and had a look at him i stood in the door for a while staring moodily at him as he lay in bed he was sleeping fairly quietly though there was an odd flushed look about him his head was tousled and unshaven there was a glass of barley water on the table by his side and a few biscuits clearly the sleep was doing him a world of good in view of the life that he had been leading during the last few days that was hardly a matter for surprise i stood there in the doorway for a long time staring at him and wondering what the devil was going to happen about it all three lenden slept till about nine oclock that night and woke up more or less himself i was working at the rent rolls in the sittingroom when i heard him stirring through the open doors because it was getting on towards quarter day and im always pretty full up about that time i went in to have a look at what he was up to and found him sitting up in bed evening i said how dyou feel now he moistened his lips im better he said thickly he shivered suddenly and slid down beneath the bedclothes again ive had the hell of a go this time a proper searcher i went and sat on the foot of his bed want a drink theres something there barley water or something or ill get you a whisky he craned his head to look at the tumbler no thanks not now ill go to sleep again in a bit i dont ever remember being like this whats the time about nine oclock he passed one hand heavily across his forehead there was a girl here this afternoon he muttered she gave me some stuff to drink i nodded miss darle i said she told me shed been with you oh he was silent for a minute i was talking a good bit he said thickly i hope to god i wasnt telling stories i laughed i dont know what you said i remarked but anyway you didnt say anything to shock her he smiled faintly thats all right then he muttered matter of fact i dont know what i was talking about but i know i was talking i made him comfortable for the night persuaded him to have a drink and he rolled over on his side to go to sleep again i left him to it iwent back into the sittingroom and shut up my books there were a couple of ledgers and the cashbook of the mansion there among the others i piled these three together and went to put them in the safe the top of the safe is a sort of repository for all the odds and ends that lie about my rooms and never get tidied up i was brought up sharply as i approached it by the sight of that box of plates there it was lying on the top of the safe with all the other junk one of the maids must have put it there when she tidied up the room in the morning i opened the safe and put away my books and then picked this thing up and carried it over to the fire it was a rectangular flat metal box roughly halfplate size made of brass oxidized or blackened in some way and neatly finished i sat down uneasily before the fire and had a good look at the thing it wasnt mine it hadnt anything to do with me really it belonged to lenden and to him it was worth approximately one thousand pounds the fee that he had taken he had that money in his bank it was nothing to do with me at all that was the basic conclusion that i came to at the end of a quarter of an hour i sat there for a long time turning the thing over uneasily in my hands wondering what the devil they were up to at portsmouth and why the soviet wanted to know about it i didnt see what interest it could hold for them they couldnt possibly be contemplating naval action against us they hadnt got a navy for one thing i didnt see why they should be interested in our dockyards other than from a purely academic standpoint it seemed to me that their attitude might very well be thats a nicelooking dockyard lets have one like that at tkechkrotsz but it was hardly likely that they would be interested in the proposition thats the place to hit this handsome dockyard a cruel blow when we want to put it out of action next week and yet it must be something like that the people at portsmouth evidently thought it was important to judge from the precautions they were taking sending up planes to shoot him down it seemed to me that he couldnt possibly have been right about that his nerves had been running away with him three long night flights on end they must have been in any case it didnt seem to me that i could do anything about it it was lendens business ive never been a man to go butting into another chaps affairs and it didnt seem to me that i could go to him and talk about our dear old country and what a sin and a shame it was to go and take photographs of it when it wasnt look ing no i could only leave it to him to do what he thought best though i knew what that would be hed taken their money and hed do their work still it was none of my business and in that resolve i went to bed i didnt sleep very well i was still worried about those photographs and in the intervals of that i was thinking of the quiet time i had had at under since the war i kept sleepily conning over the details of that sale at pithurst and the way id been able to run up the auction on that stock to make the price and then i got to thinking of all the other times that arner had set me on to do that sort of thing and the way wed been running the estate since the war and i thought that really taking it by and large wed made a pretty good show of it mind weve got good land and a good crowd of farmers and that helps but wed made that part of sussex pretty prosperous wed been stuffing back into the land pretty well all that we took out of it and i knew that ellersleigh whose land marched with ours to the north and west was doing the same and then i got to worrying about those photographs again and to thinking what a corking good county sussex was it was about three in the morning before i fell was a day of accounts i spent it entirely at the office with my clerk deep in the usual quarter day rush i saw lenden in the morning before i went out he was looking at the worse for wear but his temperature was practically normal he didnt seem to be in any flurry to get away i sat and talked to him for a while after breakfast but avoided any direct or indirect question as to what he was going to do i didnt think he knew himself till he had made up his mind there was very little to be done i just encouraged him to stay in bed for another day and left him to it that was saturday arner was in town that week living at the house in curzon street and oscillating between the foreign office and the athenaeum in the middle of the afternoon i had a trunk call from him is that moran speaking sir moran i shall be coming down this afternoon by the fourfifty youd better send the car to petersfield i think right you are sir ill see to that and moran i am bringing wingcommander dermott of the air ministry down with me he will be staying with us over the weekend will you ring up the hall and let them know we will dine at eight oclock tonight right i said th ring up at once and moran i should be very glad if you would dine with us this evening is sheila dining in tonight i think so i havent heard that shell be away oh then we shall be an odd number still i should be very glad if you would dine with us i want you to meet dermott id like to very much sir all right is there anything else i stirred in my chair and settled to the more important business of my work that sale of petersens yesterday over at pithurst it went off very well i gave him a short summary of the business done and the prices the beasts went for we had another three minutes over that and then he rang off i called up the house to give them their instructions and settled to my accounts again but my work was spoilt arners sudden introduction of this wingcommander worried me and took my mind completely off my business in all the years i had been at under we had never entertained any officer of his majestys royal air force this was something quite new lord arner was over seventy at that time and a civil servant of the old type we had admirals and generals at under frequently because these were old friends of his men that he had known at school and at oxford and at the athenaeum the air force was since his time something new and possibly not quite nice i dont think he had any definite bias against it but it was since his time he didnt know any of their groupcaptains or air vicemarshals or whatever their peculiar titles were they were all twenty years or so younger than he and so it happened that wingcommander dermott would be the first officer of that distinguished service who had ever been to under unless it was myself i wondered irritably who he was and what the devil he was doing here i couldnt repress a most uneasy feeling that he was after me there was a book that i wanted to consult and i gave up the pretence of work at the office early in its favour i left the town at about teatime and walked back to the hall i crossed the stableyard entered the mansion by the back door went through into the hall and so to the library the volume that i wanted lives on the writingtable there together with whitaker and bradshaw i crossed the room and opened it upon the blotting pad d for dermott said miss darle reflectively it was a dull evening and that room faces north as all libraries should in the dim light i hadnt noticed her sitting in a deep chair before the fire she couldnt have been reading because it was too dark if i had thought about it at all i had assumed that she was in the drawingroom now thats a queer thing looking back upon those days now it seems very strange that i shouldnt have known that she was with me in the room but i didnt i glanced towards her chair exactly i replied i always have to do this im afraid im not sufficiently acquainted with the beau monde i turned the pages to the ds his names john hilary dermott she said quietly without stirring from where she sat he went to school at uppingham and then he went to sandhurst and then he went into the shropshires and then he got transferred to the balloon service of the sappers before they made it into the flying corps i had found the place by now she was quite right except that he was attached and not transferred he had served with the flying branch of the army from till it became the royal air force and so had attained the rank of wingcommander at the age of thirtyeight what does int after his name mean she asked i shrugged my shoulders casually i dont know i replied but i did it meant intelligence and the sight of it gave me a nasty turn i stood there blankly for a minute wondering if i ought to get lenden out of the place before he came sheila darle got up from beside the fire and came over towards that writingtable by the window i was still staring at that brief account mr moran she said gently i raised my head to meet her eyes is this bloke coming on any sticky business there was no point in beating about the bush she knew too much already i dont know i muttered i hope to god hes not i dont see how he could possibly be but i dont know she stood there eyeing me for a moment silent and then at the last she said can i do anything anything at all i turned to face her i dont think theres anything you could do i replied its just that hes got himself into the dickens of a mess and i suppose im in it too its a rotten business to be mixed up in and id rather that you kept out of it its with russia she inquired i nodded yes she thought about it for a minute im so frightfully sorry she said quietly if i can do anything at all to help you must let me know and went i put that book back in its place between whitaker and bradshaw left the library and went over to my own house lenden was still in bed but sitting up and reading a novel he was looking very much more himself he said that he was getting up next day he said that it had been damn good of me to let him lie up like that i cut him short and went and sat on the end of his bed dyou know anything about a fellow called dermott i inquired wingcommander dermott he wrinkled his brows and shook his head slowly no ive heard the name somewhere well i said hes coming down here tonight lord arners bringing him down to spend the weekend i paused the only thing i know about him is that hes in the raf intelligence there was a little silence and then lenden smiled l thought this was too good to be true he said quietly id better get along out of it i shook my head i wouldnt do that he may not be coming about you at all i dont see how he can be and anyway you cant cut off now everyone knows youre here youll have to stay and bluff it out he stared at me wonderingly i dont see how they could know im here he said unless theyve found the breguet i thought that over for a minute it was certainly a possibility i havent seen it since yesterday morning i said but i should have heard if it had been found i hear everything that goes on here does this chap come down here often asked lenden i laughed shortly no i said he doesnt weve not had an raf officer in the place since the war there was a little silence at that id better go he said its been damn good of you to put me up like this and i dont want to get you into trouble frankly i replied i think youre more likely to get me into trouble if you go than if you stay do you think so i do h this blokes really after you and he gets to hear that youve shot off the minute you heard he was coming i dont see how he could help putting two and two together even if he is in the intelligence he considered the position for a bit i suppose youre right he said uncertainly id better stay for tonight anyway he paused gloomily ive got those photographs to get rid of somehow he flared up suddenly i wish to hell id never touched the ruddy job he said irritably i left him soon after that and went into my room to dress for dinner it was early but i was tired and worried and i wanted a bath i stayed in it for a considerable time that evening i remember i was wondering what was going to happen to me i had about a couple of hundred a year of my own at that time and i was wondering how far that would go if i had to find another job over this business i was wondering what i could turn my hand to if i had to leave under i was wondering why i had been such a fool as to take in lenden and why i didnt give him up i had only to ring up the police and the thing would be done i was wondering whether it would be much of a blow to arner when he found out the game that id been playing in his house i was wondering how the next agent would run the estate when he took over from me and if hed grow to care about it all as i had done i was wondering if the game was worth the candle i got out of my bath as it began to cool off and dressed very slowly for dinner in the end i was ready and i went into the sittingroom to my piano it was dark in there i lit the readinglamp by the fireplace sat down absently and began polishing the second period of my play that is the part where the princess goes to jive with the woodman in his hut from that point i begin upon the change in values under the harsher conditions of the rustic life that in the end turn the peasant into a prince within the hut and the princess to a peasant girl those are effects that one can work up rather subtly upon the screen but its a difficult bit of music i became immersed in the thing and sat there in the halflight before dinner for the better part of an hour polishing those passages till in the end by the time i got up from the piano i was ready for what i could see was going to be rather a trying evening at about halfpast seven i went over to the house there was nobody about downstairs i passed the open door of the diningroom on my way through the hall and paused for a minute the table was laid for five that room would seat fifty without inconvenience i suppose the house is georgian but arner entertained very little in all the years that i had been at under i dont suppose that i had seen that table laid for more than ten people it was his fancy always to dine by candlelight i remember that the white and silver table in the shaded light from the candelabra made a little gleaming oasis in the darkness of that great room sanders was there wandering reverently around the table now and again he would pause to shift a saltcellar an inch or two or to pick up a spoon breathe on it and polish it he told me that commander dermott had arrived he was dressing i passed on to the deserted drawingroom there was a bright fire in the grate i switched on a light and went and stood before it i had had great kindness from the arners during the seven years that i had been at under one of my uncles married a secondcousin of lady arner they had chosen to regard that as a close tie and had treated me more as a member of the family than as a salaried official of the estate i remember thinking about those things as i stood there before the fire that evening waiting for the family to come down i was wondering what sort of a show i was going to put up that quarter of an hour came to an end before i had decided in the least what i was going to do lady arner came down first followed by sheila darle in a little green fumy dress that made her look a child lady arner was frankly curious about this wingcommander that her husband had brought down she wanted to know what he had come for i wanted to know that too but with the best will in the world i couldnt tell her she said that arner had had a very heavy day in town from which i inferred that things were none too bright at the foreign office and then till the others came we talked about her garden the one subject of which she never tired she was a great gardener she used to spend all the summer grubbing about in an old skirt and an old straw hat and a pair of gloves with watson our head gardener in attendance i can remember winter evenings when she would sit from halfpast eight till eleven before the fire in the drawingroom pencil in hand with catalogues from carter sutton and bunyard on her knee dreaming and as often as not falling asleep she didnt go to london much arner came down at last with dermott and we went in to dinner dermott was a youngerlooking man than i had expected he must have been about six foot two in height and thin he was cleanshaven with thin fair hair blue eyes and long young face he looked very little over thirty i was introduced to him he greeted me frankly good evening mr moran he said ive been hearing about you from lord arner he tells me that you were in the rfc in the war he had a pleasant quiet voice thats a good long time ago i replied ive pretty well forgotten all about it he smiled a little anxiously you havent kept up with flying i laughed lord no i said give me pigs and we sat down to table dinner was a constrained meal arner sat at the head of the table a sombre little figure with rather untidy thin grey hair and a monocle on the end of a black silk ribbon this evening he was evidently tired and seemed in some way to have grown smaller and older things must have been going very badly up in town that day he spoke very little there was some understanding between him and his guest both were preoccupied though dermott was talking rather at random to lady clearly there was business to be done and both of them were only waiting till the ladies had left the room that happened at last i got up to open the door for them to pass out and closed it softly behind them sanders placed the port convenient to lord arner and disappeared into the gloom i came back to the table and sat down arner motioned us to the cigars but did not take one himself immediately instead he leaned a little forward with his elbows on the table and put both hands to his forehead raising his head and drawing his hands down his face tilt he was staring straight ahead of him again i knew that motion i took a cigar things bad in town sir he dropped his hands on to the table middling he said rustically middling remind me to order the studio for curzon street moran i nodded ill see about it tomorrow i replied i knew what he meant by that he had in the library at under all the bound volumes of the studio since the beginning when he was worried or upset over anything he used to go in there and sit down beside the fire and turn these volumes over slowly when he came to a picture that he liked he would sit staring at it for a long time without moving he liked watercolour reproductions best i think and especially garden sketches water colours of herbaceous borders and paintings with delicate bright colours sometimes he would pass the heavy volume across to me when he had found a drawing that he particularly admired he roused himself look here moran he said ive brought wingcommander dermott down from london to have a talk with you hes in the intelligence service of the royal air force he dropped his head into his hands again you know the trouble with russia he said wearily its been going on for years now been brewing for the last eighteen months i had a long talk with faulkner today well its come to a head at last i think when we must force the issue there was a cabinet all yesterday afternoon and again this morning theres mouth thats what dermotts come down about and we think its them he stared at the decanter if that should be established it might prove to be the deciding factor the least thing can swing the balance now this thing has been done by an aeroplane dermott will tell you about that i was sent for this afternoon to the air ministry they are of the opinion that one of the aeroplanes engaged in this espionage was brought down on thursday night they think it landed in this part of the country theyve named an area in the square formed by pithurst leventer courton down and under thats all our land i said quietly he turned to me i know thats what i want you to consult with dermott about this things too delicate to be handled by the local constable but you know the country and the people better than i do myself much better than the police you know every hedge and field on the estate and you know the tenants i told them at the ministry that if an aeroplane had landed on my ground and they wanted to find out about it quietly you were the man to see i told them id bring dermott down with me and he could have a talk with you he turned to dermott youll want to go over the ground tomorrow i suppose i shall be able to say more about that when ive had a talk with mr moran lord arner arner nodded wearily youd better carry on straight ahead moran is completely in my confidence you can speak plainly to him i shifted uneasily in my chair arner reached out slowly for a cigar and lit it dermott turned to me i understand that you were a pilot in the war mr moran he said of a sort i replied i was never anything to write home about he smiled still with that experience youll probably be able to give me a lot of help first of all i think id better give you the outlines of this this espionage youll see better then what we want to know he paused theres something going on at portsmouth he said at last and seemed to consider for a minute a certain operation at the ministry the air ministry we do not consider this operation to be our concern at all we regard it as purely an admiralty matter youll appreciate the position theres very little to be gained by discussing this operation i nodded i can take that for granted right now a part of the work necessary in the carry ing out of this scheme is maritime and is so placed as to be in full view of the shore generally speaking all operations that concern harbour defences and matters of that sort are regarded as secret but usually that secrecy is only relative you see what i mean if a fort is to be built the admiralty can go on saying its secret till theyre blue in the face but there it is and any passerby can see the muzzles of the guns sticking out he blew a long cloud of smoke in this instance which is in no way connected with the defences of the port secrecy really is most urgent its vital for that reason since a part of the operation can be seen from the shore it was arranged to carry out the necessary maritime work at night he paused and eyed me steadily twice in the last week this work has been overlooked and possibly photographed each time an aeroplane the nature of which we dont yet know has flown over and dropped a large magnesium flare i nodded slowly without taking my eyes from his face the first time it happened was on monday night the bare appeared suddenly at a height of about two thousand feet and burnt for perhaps a minute it came as a complete surprise there was a tendency at first to put it down to a natural phenomenon a meteor of some sort thats all nonsense of course i wrinkled my brows if it was an aeroplane surely youd have heard it i remarked they make the devil of a noise unless they are silenced theres been a lot of progress made in that direction in this country i hadnt heard of that i said ive been away from flying for so long he knocked the ash from the end of his cigar on to a plate the same thing happened last thursday night he said this time the machine was seen it got too close to the light and was seen clearly for a few seconds in the light of its own flare we were fully alive to the situation then and certain antiaircraft measures had been put in hand well they didnt come off the machine got away without being identified i blew a long cloud of smoke i imagine youll make it pretty hot for him if he comes again i remarked if he comes again repeated dermott he may not were by no means sure that he got away on thursday in fact we think he landed here i paused for a moment before replying i see i said at last what makes you think that two bits of evidence the lighthousekeepers at the nab tower report that they heard the engine of an aeroplane come on suddenly not so very far away theyve got an acoustic apparatus there that tells them roughly the direction of any sound its a simple thing they use it for ships in fog they turned it on to this aeroplane he smiled now their evidence is rather interesting they say that the sound was steady for half a minute or so just the normal noise of an aeroplane it seemed to be coming straight towards them then they heard the engine shut off and opened out again that happened three times then the machine seemed to stop coming towards them and apparently turned towards the coast travelling in a northerly direction till they lost it none of our own aircraft were in the vicinity at the time apart from that he said we have definite evidence that the machine turned inland i raised my eyebrows we had a bit of real good luck a sergeant fitter from the gosport squadron was on leave that night and was cycling with his girl between chichester and arundel hes a chichester man he heard this aeroplane over him and he saw it there was a moon behind clouds thin clouds so that there was a light patch in the sky he got off his bicycle when he heard the machine and as he was looking round he saw it cross this patch of light i moistened my lips thats a bit of luck i said he nodded just one chance in a hundred but he saw it the machine was flying due north and by his account it was climbing to gain height rapidly he says it was a large singleengined biplane possibly with extensions to the upper wing as an air force sergeant he could tell a good deal from the noise of the machine he was of the opinion that the engine was a twelvecylinder watercooled broadarrow type three banks of four of about four or five hundred horsepower fitted with a large slowrunning propeller driven through an epicyclic gear with a reduction of at least two to one and with a double exhaustmanifold that carried the gases well down the fuselage lord arner laid down his cigar and drew one hand across his eyes now that to me he said is one of the most curious features of commander dermotts story i find it most remarkable that this man should be able to give full details of the engine in an aeroplane merely from the sound as it flew over him most remarkable and most extraordinary he relapsed into silence dermott paused for a minute and then continued he only saw the machine for a few seconds but he continued to hear it for several minutes when it crossed the moon from him he judged it to be at a height of about three thousand feet and climbing rapidly he heard its engine for two or three minutes longer by which time it was a considerable distance to the north of him the engine was then shut off and he heard nothing more i nodded slowly the machine landed apparently did the sergeant make any effort to find the machine no when he heard the engine shut off he judged the machine to be four or five miles to the north of him it was a quiet night you see to look for the machine m those circumstances was hopeless for one man and besides he was on leave and hed got a girl with him he thought hed seen a forced landing by one of our own nightflying aircraft on a practice flight so he cycled on to chichester and parked his girl and rang up his commanding officer at gosport to give him the information he was silent that is all the evidence i asked thats all i laid down my cigar and leaned forward on the table and from a study of the map you think he put down in the area lord arner mentioned pithurst leventer courton down and under we think so i thought about it for a minute there are a great number of places in that area where an aeroplane could land even at night i said but surely its a bit premature to assume that she landed at all she may only have started to fly silently if she could do that once she could do it again he shook his head that has been suggested but against that weve got what happened at the nab you know what happens when a pilot finds his engine flagging a stoppage in the petrol supply perhaps he throttles his engine down and then opens out again to try and clear it you do it on a car just the same and if he cant get it right he turns towards the best country for a forced landing and climbs to gain height before it peters out altogether so that he can have time to look about for a safe landingground while hes gliding down there was a long silence at last that all fits in i said i must say it looks as if something of the sort had happened still thats two days ago i can hardly believe that the aeroplane can still be here i must have heard of it before this i paused for a moment you see i said quietly i hear everything that goes on here he inclined his head quite so frankly i dont to find the aeroplane that would be too mach to hope for too good to be true i think it most likely that the pilot landed contrived to rectify the trouble and got away again very likely ive come down here on a wildgoose chase but the least evidence about this thing will be of value to us now youve named a mighty big area of country i muttered the candles were nickering m some draught about the table throwing great dancing shadows in the corners of the room and glinting on the silver i dropped my head into my hands and sat staring at my plate for a minute or two i was thinking of lenden im not a strong man myself nor a clever one i had to make my decision in that moment im damned if i know now whether i did right or not i raised my head the funny thing is that i was out that night myself i said i was driving back from winchester with a friend we didnt get in till about two in the morning but i saw nothing of all this now that to me sums up the whole essence of that evening the earlier part of it at any rate looking back upon it now after all these months i dont know that i regret it a further point said dermott do you know of any one disaffected in the neighbourhood anyone who might be expected to give assistance in such a case you mean anyone with russian sympathies he nodded i shook my head slowly were an agricultural county you see i dont know of any redhot bolsheviks here weve got a few cranks of course theres a chap here in under a hairdresser who talks communism in the market on saturdays he doesnt count no theres nobody that i know of arner nodded gravely that is also my opinion i dont see much chance of a conspiracy i replied i dont quite frankly from what youve said i think that if that machine had trouble that forced her to land she must have put it right and got away again without anyone being any the wiser otherwise i think i must have heard of it there was a long silence and then it doesnt look very promising said dermott ruefully it was an offchance from the first of course i began to describe to him the various possible landinggrounds in that part of the country they were innumerable on the downs and very many in the farming land for the better part of an hour i led him in a random detailed discussion of the neighbourhood i told him everything that i could think of about the area that he was interested in and i told him nothing that was of any value to him at all we gave it up at last and went through into the drawingroom it must have been about ten oclock by then we had settled that m the morning i should take dermott for a run over the area in a car and point out to him what i considered to be the most favourable landinggrounds but i had done my work pretty well by the time we left the diningroom i could see that he regarded the whole matter as a useless quest and that he was already wondering whether it would not be better for him to get back to london straight away lord arner said roundly that he thought we should find nothing at all i didnt think that i should have much difficulty in concealing the breguet from an investigation conducted in that spirit in the drawingroom we all had to brace ourselves a little to be entertaining for an hour before bed as the easiest way out of a difficult position for we were all preoccupied that night arner picked on me i wasnt sorry to sit down and play to them it saved the necessity for talking lady arner has a great attachment to light opera i remember playing saintsaлns for her that evening with a considerable effort to take the treacle out of mon cњur se lиve а ta voix and a little verdi then i went wandering for a bit and i remember playing one fine day now that was a funny thing she liked that best of all but would never ask for it she used to ask for mon cњur and for bits of la traviata and she liked schubert but i cannot remember that she has ever asked for butterfly although she likes it best of all the evening came to an end at last that part of it at any rate lady arner gathered her things together presently and went up to bed taking sheila with her i think our acting must have been pretty poor arner rang the bell and we had a whisky and soda together rather a silent one and then i said goodnight and went back to my house across the still moonlit stableyard lenden was up when i got back and sitting in a chair before the fire in my pyjamas and dressinggown he told me that he was much better and had got up while they made his bed and had stayed up i could see that he was better he had shaved and looked altogether more himself i mooned uncertainly about the room for a bit and then lit a cigarette and sat down this fellow dermott i said lenden looked up quickly what about him hes after you all right theyve got quite a good idea of what you did and where you came from they know you landed somewhere near here i paused dermott came to get me to help try and find you oh he stared at me darkly did you i chucked the match into the fire no i said after a minute as a matter of fact i didnt why not i shrugged my shoulders i dont know what did he want you to do i leaned back in my chair just to help him get any information there was to be had they know the machine landed in thispart and they came to me as a sort of private detective i suppose because i hear all the gossip because if anyone knew anything it would be me thats why they came we had a long talk about it they dont know you by name and theyre not sure where the machine came from they know you had engine trouble and had to land thats all they think now that you must have put it right and got away again he stared morosely into the fire so i would have done if id had a bit of pipe its only a little thing but id got nothing not a tool of any sort one never thinks of carrying tools in an aeroplane he sat there brooding in his chair for a long time after that it must have been a long time because i remember that his cigarette went out between his fingers till at last i dont know why you went and did that he said slowly why didnt you tell them that i was here i turned to him in blank amazement itd have meant about ten years in quod for you if i had i replied curtly apparently that was quite a new idea to him he looked across at me vaguely would it i laughed shortly it ruddy well would i used to be a lawyer he was silent then for a minute staring into the shadows of the room beyond me even so he said quietly it might have been the best thing to have done i got up irritably and stood with my back to the fire im damned if i see that i said youre out of the wood now practically this chap dermott will go away tomorrow ive just about finished with him ive only got to run him round a bit in the car and keep him away from the breguet and then hell go youll have nothing to worry about then well burn the breguet and then youll be free to do what you like he took me up at once what do you suppose thats going to be that point hadnt occurred to me before i stood there eyeing him for a minute and then i made a sudden movement its no business of mine i said impatiently i dont know what youre going to do he laughed met very pleasantly neither do i after that there was a long silence in the room presently i went over to the piano and sat down but i didnt play i sat there fingering the keys polishing them with my handkerchief and wondering what the devil was going to happen to him it hadnt struck me before that that might be a bit of a problem does anyone in england know you went to russia i inquired he shrugged his shoulders i didnt tell anyone and i went out on a forged passport i dropped my hands from the keyboard then i dont see that it matters you can stay in england if you want to he turned on me englands no damn good without a job its all very well for you to talk in a place like this but for me the last job i had was in the garage ruddy good fun that i was silent and presently he began to talk you see its not as if i had a home in england now he said ive got nowhere to go to or anything its been damn good of you to let me lie up here like this and its given me a chance to think things out lying in bed all the time and i think id better go back to russia i moved over to the sideboard a little ashamed of my self have a drink i said he took a whisky and sat down again before the fire i kaow what youre thinking he muttered you think i ought to go to scotland yard like a briton and give up these ruddy photographs well im not going to im going back to russia with them i set down my glass do whatever you like i said phlegmatically do what you thinkll do you most good he disregarded that ive thought it all out im going back to russia theres good jobs to be had out there and im in one of them its a good country if you can learn to hold your tongue its good pay and you can live decently more than you can in this damn country ill take on again with them and stay out there for another five years or so and then maybe ill come back and put what ive saved into a business you could do that now i said he turned and stared at me what about these plates i fingered my tumbler for a minute forget about them you dont want to go mucking about with that sort of thing if youre going to stay in england he shook his head slowly thats not the way i do business he said ive always played what i thought was the straight game and im damned if ill chuck it now i nodded i had a feeling that perhaps he might be looking at it like that business is business send back the thousand then i suggested to arcos he stared at me blankly i dont see the point of that that means id have no money and no job he paused id be a damn sight better off in russia im getting eight hundred a year there you know sterling i eyed him thoughtfully theres one other way i said whats that send the plates by post to the soviet embassy to send back to russia but stay in england yourself with the thousand there was a bit of cork in his tumbler he sat there for a long time studying this thing swishing it round and round the edge of the glass till at last i dont think that would work he said slowly you cant run with the hare and hunt with the hounds like that its what every bloody little pimp and dago does you can stick to the service and be a hundred per cent englishman or you can go into business with the other side its got to be one thing or the other you cant have it both ways and im free to choose if id got a wife and a home to go to and a chance of kids it might be different maybe id chuck it up then and stay in england and hope something would turn up like i used to but i dont want to do that now i want to get away from the whole bloody issue he said a little plaintively t thought all this out before i went to russia first of all and ive been thinking about it again now and i dont see any reason to change he drained his glass and set it down upon the table its the kids he muttered if there was any chancepf home and kids itd be different i got up from my chair and put my glass upon the mantelpiece do what you like i said absently i expect youre right and with that we went to bed i undressed slowly that night wondering what i ought to do about it i didnt much care for the thought of lenden getting away with those photographs and taking them back to russia and i had an idea too that he didnt want to go himself i thought then and i still think that it would have been a relief to him if i had gone over to the mansion there and then and given him up to dermott i wish to god i had i got into bed and pretty soon i fell asleep i was roused by sanders in the middle of the night i sleep pretty heavily and i woke up slowly to find him shaking me by the shoulder mr moran mr moran sir i opened one eye and leaned up on one elbow whats the trouble i muttered it was still quite dark outside the old man was inadequately dressed in a shirt and trousers covered by an overcoat but dignified withal lord arner would be glad if you would go over to the library sir he sent me to wake you good god said i whats the time about four oclock sir i rubbed my eyes and sat up in bed it was very cold right you are i said ill be over in about ten minutes dyou know whats happening there was a telephone call came through at about two oclock sir a trunk call you know sir the extension to the bell rings in my bedroom i nodded sleepily who was it for for commander dermott i went to his bedroom sir and called him to answer it because they said it was urgent it was a call from gosport official business i imagine sir i was suddenly awake whats been happening since then there have been several other calls the commander went to see lord arner in in his dressing room after the first one sir lord arner came downstairs about an hour ago commander dermott is with him in the library now i think the gentlemen have been speaking to london on the telephone i slipped out of bed on to the floor right you are i said ill be over in a minute or two i dressed hurriedly when he had gone and went across the stableyard to the mansion it was very cold outside in the yard the moon was bright a brilliant night with patches of loose cloud swinging across the moon in a strong westerly breeze i paused for a minute and looked around at the hurrying clouds and at the stars between that was no night for espionage there was no cover in the sky i found dermott with arner in the library both were fully dressed in morning clothes they had made up the fire into a great blaze and dermott had drawn up a little table before it he was sitting at this table when i went in and he had it all littered with papers and a map arner was in his usual chair before the fire the little table at his elbow morning sir i said as i went in nothing wrong i hope dermott raised his head and turned towards me there has been a development of this spying he said my information is very brief the machine has been over portsmouth this evening for the third time and dropped the usual flare exactly as before they were ready for it this time the machine was shot down by one of our own night fighters and crashed in a field near hamble i didnt speak lord arner turned to me sit down moran he said it will not be long now before we hear the whole of this affair dermott turned again to his papers im expecting a report in a few minutes he remarked jackson and pilot are on their way here now by road they started about an hour ago in the library it was very still arner was sitting huddled up in his great leather armchair before the fire slowly filling a pipe dermott was silent and immersed in his papers at the table i could not see what he was doing i drew up a chair upon the other side of the table and sat down before the fire for a long time the little roaring of the flames and the little crashes of the embers were the only noises that i heard in that great room presently arner lit his pipe and threw the match into the grate and reaching down dragged out a heavy volume from the bookcase by his chair he snapped on the readinglight beside him opened the book upon his knees and began turning the pages slowly with long pauses the blue smoke coiling thinly above his head into the darkness for over half an hour we must have sat like that a silence broken only by the fire by the rustle of dermotts papers as he made his notes or by the occasional rippling as arner turned a page at last dermott pushed back his chair glancing from his watch to the clock they should have been here by now he muttered arner raised his head it is a very long way fortyfive miles said dermott incisively say an hour and a quarter he glanced down at his host as he stood before the fire and his eyes rested curiously on the volume for a minute helooked puzzled perhaps that book didnt quite fit in with his conception of a diplomat but arner had a picture of a devon lane there and he never stirred or looked up in the last few days it seemed to me that he had aged very rapidly i listened for a moment in the stillness and stood up theres a car coming now i said they must have made pretty good time from gosport i went through the hall to the door and opened it as the car drew up a big american fiveseater perhaps a stutz or chrysler two men in uniform greatcoats got out of it in the light that streamed from the door i could see that one of them was very young as young as i was when i used to play that game the elder of the two came up the steps first and stood peering at me for a moment wingcommander dermott he inquired hes inside waiting for you i replied come in i showed them through the hall into the library dermott and arner were standing there together before the fire evening jackson said dermott squadronleader jackson lord arner he turned to jackson again and jackson motioned to his companion flyingofficer mackenzie sir he said this was a sandyhaired palefaced young man i dont think he can have been more than twentyone or twentytwo years old he was a well setup athleticlooking young fellow but he was curiously white as he stood there his eyes were wandering uneasily around the room it seemed to me that he was nervous and more than a little shaken what about the letters said dermott briskly youve brought them with you jackson nodded there are three or four sir he replied so far as i have been able to make out this pilot was a german subject operating from kieff there is an addressed envelope he laid down a large official envelope and opened it on the table from it he took two crumpled letters and a little flat packet wrapped in some coarse cloth these are the letters he said dermott opened them one by one and skimmed rapidly through the spidery writing on the pages these are in german he said to arner and dropped his eyes to the paper again from his wife he muttered a sentence or two in german half to himself and flicked over the page they are addressed to leutnant friedrich keumer at an address in kieff they contain nothing but local gossip and news of his children what one would expect he smiled at the paper a little cynically elsa has with franz to the steiner this afternoon gone he read so i am alone he laid down the letter arner inclined his bead a german pilot flying for the soviet he inquired i think so replied dermott he reached for the cloth packet whats in this jackson was before him and took it up more letters sir those that you have were found in one of the side pockets on the righthand side these are from the breast pocket on the left im afraid youll find them in rather a mess dermott took the packet and unwrapped it carefully inside there was a sodden pulp of paper reddish black in colour and very sticky he turned the mass over curiously with his forefinger stared at it for a moment and then wrapped it up again in the fabric cant do much with these im afraid he remarked coolly theyll have to be treated arner nodded gravely make that boy sit down he said hes looking quite ill isaw mackenzie stiffen im quite all right sir he said dermott and jackson turned and stared at him he was certainly very white i turned to jackson youve had a long drive i said and its cold outside what about a whisky thats right said arner give him a whisky and while i was fiddling with the siphon and the glasses dermott turned again to jackson what was the machine a breguet xix with the lorraine engine shes very badly crashed and its dark there was a camera but the engine is on top of it at the moment i left instructions that nothing was to be moved till dawn on account of destroying any evidence till we can get a sheerlegs and lift the engine we shant be able to get at the camera the machine seems to be a singleseater and fitted with an adjustable propeller but that again we havent examined they began upon rather a lengthy technical discussion about the best means of salving any evidence in the wrecked machine they congratulated each other on the fact that it had not caught fire a german pilot said dermott at last living in russia and flying a french machine he mused over it for a little we shall want to know more than that he turned to jackson again did you have much difficulty in getting him down mr mackenzie had better give you his report sir mackenzie pulled himself up and set down his glass there was more colour about him now id made that whisky a good one no sir he said it went all right this time dermott eyed him for a moment how long did you take to get away jackson interposed the machines three of them were off the ground thirtyfive seconds after the first alarm he said we have been practising that in the last few days with hucks starters thats very good indeed said dermott what happened then mr mackenzie said jackson the boy came forward there was a bright moon he said and the searchlights were holding the machine i didnt have to go and look for it he paused the searchlights picked up the machine almost at once said jackson from gosport and from a destroyer off southampton as soon as the flare appeared dermott interposed the pilot first major jackson mackenzie drew himself up nervously i took off as soon as the starter was clear he said before the landing lights came on flightlieutenant armstrong was next off the ground i think and then hesketh on what machines i was flying the nightjar sir armstrong and hesketh were on doves he paused to collect his story i came up with the breguet about a minute and a half later at about two thousand feet he said that was over southsea i think armstrong was somewhere near me but i dont remember seeing him the machine was still in the searchlights but it was slipping about a good bit and very nearly clear of them but there was a good moon and even if hed got clear wed still have been able to see him i think i switched on the fighting beam at once and pooped off a green very light at him as wed arranged dermott inquired did he take any notice not that i saw sir he got clear of the searchlights almost directly after that i could still see him faintly in the moonlight and brilliantly whenever i got the fighting beam on to him of course he slipped right round then and went away to the west full out i went after him he paused again i didnt gain much on him i think he must have been very nearly as fast as the nightjar sir i lost all touch with poddy then we left the doves behind we went away west for minutes on end and when id closed up till he filled the ring of my sight in the fighting light i gave him a burst of tracer bullets sir over his head did he make any reply to your fire at any time the boy swallowed violently no sir j dont think he had a gun did your fire have any effect at all no sir i thought it first he was giving up after that because he turned away and i lost sight of him for a moment i thought perhaps hed shut off and was going down to land and then i picked him up again hed turned north and he was still going full out we were over the solent then and somewhere west of lee dermott eyed him keenly what happened then i was afraid he would get away sir i was running my engine full out with the supercharger its not meant to be run like that below fifteen thousand feet but i was afraid hed get away from me i couldnt have kept up with him any other way jackson interrupted mr mackenzie means that he could only rely upon his engine to give that excess power for a very short time fie had to act quickly or not at all as you know sir i had given explicit orders that the machine was to be shot down in those circumstances dermott nodded i know lie said mr mackenzie did quite right he turned to the boy so then you shot him down yes sir there was a little silence the pilot was staring uneasily around him as though he was afraid to meet our eyes it was about halfway between lee and hamble he muttered i closed right up and gave him three bursts into the fuselage he pulled her right up as if he was going to loop over me and then he fell out of that into a spin with full engine on i think and went down like that i saw him flicking round and i saw him hit a tree his voice died away into silence you went back to the aerodrome no sir i flew about low over the fields for a bit till i found what i thought was a pasture it looked smooth enough so i landed in it with the flares it turned out to be harrow but i got her down all right it was two fields from the crash he said i left the nightjar with the lights on so that anyone flying over would see where i had put down and i ran across the fields to the crash sir and as i went i heard poddy armstrong land behind me you were the first person to reach the crash then yes sir was the pilot still alive yes sir there was a short silence the machine was very badly crashed the fuselage all telescoped on to him i had to shift the top plane before i could get at the pilot when i got that out of the way i tried to get him out of his seat but his legs were caught somehow and when i tried to move him he cried out sir the boys face was dead white so i had to leave him where he was and i just did all i could to get him into a comfortable position and find out how he was hurt you see sir it was all dark and i couldnt see very well what i was doing i did all i could he stared round at us as though he expected us to disbelieve him and he kept on trying to tell me something but i dont speak german and i didnt understand and then captain armstrong came and a minute or two after that he died arner turned away and sat down quietly before the fire and began polishing his glasses with a handkerchief can you remember anything of the sound of the words asked dermott enough to repeat what he was trying to tell you the boy shook his head im afraid not sir i was rather upset dermott bit his lip and tapped the clothcovered packet you say that these were taken from the breast pocket in that case theyll be the important ones jackson nodded the body was considerably shot about he said those were the only papers we could find its possible that there may be other evidence in the machine maps for example i have had nothing touched there was a pause thats very likely said dermott at last ill come back with you to gosport he glanced out of the window it was still quite dark it should be getting light soon he said well start directly he turned to me you were quite right this evening mr moran evidently if the machine landed here on thursday night she repaired the trouble and got away again arner raised his head by the fireside why does she keep on coming night after night she can learn all she wants to by one visit dermott shook his head i dont know we may find something to explain that in the machine anyway he said weve got her this time he asked if his suitcase could be packed i went out into the hall and found sanders drowsing in the gunroom and sent him off to see about it when i came back dermott was going over the details of the affair again with the other two arner was still sitting before the fire still taking little notice of what was going on behind him still leaning forward and polishing his glasses i remember that at the time i was very much impressed with that little action of his of all the people in the room that night arner was most able to appreciate the significance of that affair and of all the people in the room he was the least excited the most detached at last dermott had finished right he said to jackson well start at once if you wouldnt mind going out to the car and when they were out of the room he turned to arner were in for the devil of a row over this nights work sir im afraid he said we shall have questions in the house which will certainly not be answered said arner quietly but in regard to russia i dont know it depends on allen now i had a quick impression of the tremendous forces that were massing together for a catastrophe dermott walked nervously down the room and swung round at the other end i dont see what else we could have done nothing said arner you could have done nothing more he rose to his feet before the fire a short portentous little figure this thing will have to take its course and that was all of any importance that was said in a minute or two sanders came and told us that the commanders bag was in the car dermott rose to take his leave through the open door i saw jackson and mackenzie in the hall buttoning up their coats i am very sorry for that young man said arner dermott smiled hes young a good lad but hes not long out of cranwell hell get over it jacksons very good with them hell probably send him off on a months leave and thatll put him right he drew on his coat and went i walked with him to the door and waited outside at the head of the steps till i saw the lights of the car swing round to make a brilliant tunnel of the drive the night was practically cloudless the moon was sinking and the east of the sky was getting a little grey i went back into the library arner had settled down again before the fire and was slowly turning the pages of the studio the big volume firmly posed upon his knees in one hand he held his glasses before his eyes i asked if there was anything that i could do at his instructions i fetched the telephone from the morningroom and plugged it in beside him and set it on the table by his side and then youd better go back to bed moran he said theres nothing more i hesitated for a moment outside the circle of light from his readinglamp what about you sir i inquired wont you go up to bed yourself he shook his head i think i shall stay up for a little he replied and by his voice i knew that he wanted to be alone i went out of the mansion by the garden door and went round to the stableyard and to my own house it was about halfpast five and the sky was getting very grey i knew that i should sleep no more that night jaut i went into my bedroom and threw off my clothes and got back into bed it was full dawn when i gave it up got up again and dressed in the next room to my own i could hear lendens steady breathing as tie slept even and regular i went through into my sittingroom and the first thing i saw in there was that black box of plates on top of the safe looking back upon it all now j find it very curious to realize how careless of that thing we were it might just as well have been inside the safe buf we left it lying about on top as if it was of no consequence i moved across the room and took the thing up from the safe turning it over absently in my hands i was worried about arner i couldnt get any sleep myself but the thought that the old man might still be sitting over there in the library still turning over the pages of the studio in the bright morning worried me more than a little he was too old for that sort of thing i decided to go over to the mansion again to see if there was anything that i could do for him if i could persuade him to go up to bed but as i went i slipped that packet of plates into the pocket to my coat i suppose i must have known even then what i was going to do i crossed the yard and entered the mansion again by the back door there was a maid in the kitchen yawning and fiddling with the grate when she saw me in the corridor her mouth shut with an almost audible click i passed on into the house there was nobody about the library was empty and that volume of the studio was replaced in the shelf with the others arner had given it up i went over to the window and drew the curtains the rings went rattling back along the pole and the sunlight streamed in upon the room it was exactly as i had always known it as usual in that room everything was more or less in its place but not quite there was no indication of what had happened there during the night there was nothing to show that i had not dreamed of dermott and of jackson nothing to show that the evidence of that white young man was anything more than a distressing form of nightmare till my eye caught the whisky decanter and the scattered glasses and i knew that it was all quite true i dont know how long i stood there like that i dare say it was only for a minute or two it was long enough for the sense of a great responsibility to come upon me and of a great loneliness i had those plates in my pocket it was up to me now i had chosen to conceal the man who took them and now i had to do something with the ruddy things i couldnt bring myself to let him get back to russia with them unhindered i discovered as i stood there in the library that morning that it is one thing to assist in the escape of a renegade spy from justice but quite another thing to play the part oneself and then i heard steps they were on the stairs that went up at the far end of the hall in a wide shallow flight and then they were on the parquet of the hall itself i knew that it was sheila at the first sound i would have known that two years before i stood there motionless until she came i heard her pause first at the door of the drawingroom and then come on down the hall she came and stood in the doorway of the great room and looked around i remember that die was wearing a pale blue jumper and a tweed skirt she was dressed for the country there was a patch of morning sunlight that fell across that door and she stood there with the colours gleaming in her fair hair staring around the room for the moment she didnt see me but stood there her lips parted a little taking in the slight disorderliness of the room and noticing the whisky glasses and in the end she saw me mr moran i moved across the room towards her morning miss darle i said youre up bright and early she glanced up at me her eyes twinkling so are you she said demurely i nodded i do this once or twice a month i replied i like to see the men get about their work at the proper time for a moment there was silence i believe youre the best liar ive ever met she said at last i was silent mr moran i want you to tell me please whats been happening has commander dermott gone i nodded when did he go about an hour and a half ago i said he went away by road that seemed to puzzle her i heard the car from upstairs why did he go away like that i was silent she came a little closer to me and stood there looking up into my face theres nothing wrong is there not frightfully wrong i laughed its all about as wrong as it can be miss darle i said but as you say im the worlds champion liar and ive managed to put dermott off the track so i suppose thats something she had nothing to say to that i came over to see if lord arner was still up i said inconsequently she shook her head i came down and got him to go up to bed about an hour ago hes frightfully upset over something she stared at me something that happened alter we went up to bed i nodded she waited for a minute to see if i was going to tell her anything and then she said i came downstairs soon after the car went away when i heard you go over to your house he was still up and sitting in the chair here looking at the studio and i made him shut it up and go upstairs to bed i was curious how did you know that there was anything going on at all i asked because you all made such a row that you woke me up she replied mostly the telephone and then i came halfway downstairs in my dressinggown and asked sanders and then they sent over for you and after that the car came with the other two it was very quiet in the library in all the house there was nothing stirring then mr moran she said i looked down at her and looked away again she was looking very sweet that morning in the sun wont you let me know the whole thing i know most of it you know and theres always the chance that i might be able to help some way or other she certainly could almost unconsciously while we had been talking i had made up my mind i wanted a witness for what i was going to do then and i knew that whether she thought me right or wrong shed never let me down i glanced out of the window to the home farm across the meadow mattock sent over to me to say that his old mare foaled yesterday morning i remarked we might walk over and have a look at that she turned with me and we went through the hall and out of the house into the bright morning the farm lies about half a mile from the mansion and we walked slowly and as we went i told her everything that had happened from the time when i had driven back from winchester in the dark i left nothing out i went straight ahead with the events as they happened and i didnt look at her till i had finished i didnt want to see how she was taking it till she had heard the lot not even when i came to tell her about the dirty game that id been playing on arner and on dermott i was hoping that shed pull me up over that i was hoping that shed stop me and turn round in the path and tell me that i ought to be ashamed of myself if that had happened id have chucked it up there and then that was to be the touchstone for my conduct and i was waiting for it in her i had an outside view and outside opinion outside advice that i was ready to take id done my best according to my lights but i was very uncertain whether id done right and so i say that if shed told me that morning that i was playing a damn dirty game id have gone back to arner and told him the whole thing and given lenden up i wish to god i had i was hoping that shed tell me to i think but she didnt she stood there in the path looking up into my face when i had finished and as i caught her eyes that hope flickered out and died i knew then that i had to go through with it i saw that she thought id done the right thing i saw that she was proud of me and i looked away again very quickly when i saw that and the next thing was that she was speaking to me what are you going to do she asked i put my hand to the pocket of my coat and pulled out that packet of plates ive got all that matters with me here i said she glanced at them for a moment and then back to me i dont mean about those she said but about the man i stood there fingering the plates we were both of us thinking more about lenden than about the espionage that morning hes going back to russia i said thats quite definite his minds made up the only way of stopping him would be to give him up she glanced at me curiously hes a great friend of yours in the war i shook my head i hardly knew him only just casually in the mess but hes a damn good sort i dont see that one can give him up it means imprisonment and a pretty long spell maybe as long as ten years and frankly i dont think hes deserved it she nodded slowly at the same time she said i dont think you ought to let him get away to russia with the information hes got thats not playing the game either she glanced up again cant you persuade him to stay here now we ought to be able to find something he could do a little way from the path there was a fallen tree one of two that had come down a fortnight before and that we were cutting up at our leisure i moved over to it and brushed the chips from the trunk and sat down there in the sunlight she followed a little curiously and stood beside me you cant lead a grown man like that i said hes got to take his own course in that way theres nothing to be done for him im afraid hes made up his mind to go back to russia and i dont see that i can stop him she nodded gravely and then hell tell them what hes seen i looked up at her quickly and shook my head no he cant do that he tried to tell me what he saw and i dont think the russians will learn very much from that account hes too vague and confused and he only got the shortest possible glimpse but hell take the photographs back with him of course there was a momentary pause i lifted the metal box and turned it over in my hands and by the time weve done with those i said the russians wont learn much from them there wasnt much difficulty about it a little spring catch at one end of the box loosened the cover plate then there was a slide held by a sort of lockingpin and underneath the slide there was a thin metal covered in black velvet that pulled out in the same way as the slide and under it i saw the greenish first plate sheila stood there beside me very quiet and watched me fiddling with the thing got to be damn careful to remember how this bag of tricks goes together again i muttered dont want to find any bits left over that i cant put back there were twelve plates in the box each separated from the other by a velvet shield as each came out i laid it carefully upon the tree trunk in the bright sunlight until at last i had them all laid out there in a row and the box was empty sheila stirred beside me youre going to give them back to him she asked to take back to russia i nodded how long does it take to spoil them about the hundredth of a second i suppose i replied well give em a couple of minutes for luck and when that was over i put them back again i laid each plate emulsionside downwards each with a velvet plate to separate it from the others exactly as they had come out finally i replaced the slide and secured it with the lockingpin and when i had snapped the cover plate in place i turned to her that takes the sting out of it anyway i said there were only three lots of photographs taken and theyre all accounted for now there was the lot that he took on the first night and they were spoilt theres this lot that he took on the second flight and ive done them in and the third lot were shot down last night the air force will look after those she nodded now he can do what he likes thats right i said now he can do what he likes we turned and walked back to the house forgot all about the foal that we had come out to see it wasnt worth seeing anyway i told mattock that wasnt fit to breed from but he wouldnt have it i left sheila in the rose garden by the pool and she the mansion i stood and watched her till and then went over to my own in the sittingroom i took the pack of plates from my pocket and replaced it on top of the safe exactly as i had found it lenden was up and shaving he came to the door of his bedroom when he heard me moving about morning he said i say did you go out at about four oclock this morning ill swear i heard someone crashing around i nodded i went over to the house he was about to say something but stopped he was turning away when he stopped suddenly and i saw him looking across to the safe he moved across the room and took up the pack of plates that i had just laid down oughtnt to leave these lying about he said in the town a mile or so away a church bell began to toll i heard it faintly through the open window this day is sunday i remarked are you staying over the weekend he shook his head i must get up to town today i was thinking about it last night in bed if they dont hear from me soon they may be sending out the reserve machine to do the job i suppose i was tired and a little sick from the narrative of the night the cool way in which he referred to his movements stung me up properly it seemed to me that it was nothing to him that he was in my house as my guest and that he was talking of putting my country in the cart my country sussex that id sweated to make a good show of ever since the war he was ready to throw all that away i leaned against the mantelpiece and grinned the reserve machine i said cynically thats the one thats similar to yours to be flown by a chap called keumer leutnant friedrich keumer a married man lives in noremburg got two children called elsa and franz and his wife writes to him every other day he stared at me i never told you all that i laughed unpleasantly no you didnt bit of a pal of yours didnt you say shares a hut with you and all that he nodded dumbly i jerked myself suddenly erect well i said brutally hes dead got shot down over portsmouth last night doing your job and crashed in a field by hamble four almost before i had spoken i was sorry lenden stood there staring at me blankly razor in hand his mouth drooping a little at the corners he asked no questions didnt say anything at all he just stood there dumbly till i could stand it no longer and he went a sort of yellow colour under his tan i moved over to the window and stood there with my back to him looking out upon the garden im sorry i said that i said at last its been the hell of a night and im a bit tired he cleared his throat tell me what happened i turned round and gave him the account in a few short sentences i put it as gently as i could it came as a great shock to him and he showed it i can remember thinking at the time that this man keumer had evidently been a closer friend than i had quite realized and that it was curious that a man of his life and experience should suddenly appear so much alone that is the only way in which i can describe his reception of my story he was terribly alone and when i saw him like that his wife came into my mind and it struck me to wonder if she had ever quite realized the injury that she did him when she went probably not i thought he made no comment on what i had to say he listened to the end and waited for a little staring irresolutely about the room and then he moved towards the door one thing i said and he stopped whats that give it another day this is sunday youll do better to stay here till tomorrow and see whats going to happen this may make a breach with russia its very likely arner thinks it will there might even be war i paused give it another day he stood there for a minute irresolute might be best he muttered i dont want to get mixed up out there if theres going to be a war he glanced at me you dont really think therell be war he inquired i dont see how there could be i replied but i dont know he went back into his room and i went and had a bath and shaved a little later we had breakfast together in my room and during that meal lenden hardly spoke at all and afterwards he began asking me questions about keumer he wanted to know how it had happened but he was satisfied with a very brief account of that chiefly he wanted to know whether he had been able to give any messages and whether he had had any personal papers on him at the time i told him about the letters but there was very little solid information that i could give him for a time i couldnt make out what he was driving at until at last it became evident to me that lenden was worrying over the settlingup of his friends affairs he was very muddled and confused about it and yet in a way he was practical he wasnt getting so much as i was he said and i know he hadnt a bean in the world except his pay if he had he wouldnt have been at kieff none of us would it ran out to something like five hundred a year i think and he used to send over half of it home so that he was always hard up he never used to spend anything except on cigarettes the sort of chap that likes sitting before a fire and smoking and talking about his home and his kids and i dont know whats going to happen to them now as we talked it became clear that he was set on doing something for that family in noremburg that he felt that it was up to him to do something he said he knew they hadnt any money and he didnt think they had any relatives that would be of any value to them he didnt know if there was any sort of poor relief in germany but anyway he couldnt let keumers wife go on the dole he didnt even know their address except that they lived in noremburg i suggested that keumer had probably got his fee in advance and sent it home as lenden had done himself lenden didnt think it likely he was so damn casual he said he wouldnt have bothered about it i dont know what to do he said that keumer used to take snapshots of the aerodrome and of the town and send them home to his wife with long letters he said that he had an album full of photographs of his wife and children and of his house and of his garden that he used to show round upon the least encouragement you see said lenden we were more or less the same sort and keen on the same things id have had a place like that myself one time i dont know what to do he said that part of it at any rate was none of my business i left him and went over to the house lady arner was at home so it was no part of my duties to go to church that sunday morning she liked some representative of the family to be there on occasions when the family were away it was my business to attend presumably to ensure that the padre read the lessons right this morning i was free and i went over to the gunroom to see if i could find the sunday papers there was a copy of the scrutator there and one of the worlds news i opened the scrutator first and glanced at the political news there was nothing to add to the situation as i already knew it in regard to russia i skimmed through the remainder of the news on the chief page and idly turned the lesser pages before abandoning it and there in among the motorcar advertisements i saw an article that brought me up with a jerk it was headed the argentine air survey at a meeting of the royal aeronautical held at the royal society of arts on friday last at pm captain s t robertson mc gave a detailed account of the conditions governing the work of the aerial surveyor in semicivilized countries the lecture which was of a highly technical nature was entitled the survey of inaccessible areas and was the occasion of a large attendance there was a column and a half about it it was all about grids and traverses and rectifying cameras with a little about aeroplanes thrown in i didnt read it all through in detail it was clear from the space devoted to the paper in the scrutator that the lecturer was no slouch at the game and that on air survey he must be regarded as a leading authority that was certainly interesting but what concerned me far more than the technical ability of the lecturer was the fact that lendens old friend and employer of the honduras affair was in england and accessible i turned to the worlds news and idly glanced through the scandalous indifferently printed pages and there dovetailed in between a murder and a rape i came upon the reverse of the medal airman in the dock constables grave charge of assault yesterday morning at vine street captain samuel robertson described as an air surveyor and giving as his address the phalanx residential club was charged with drunkenness and assault pc skinner gave evidence that the offence was committed near hyde park corner at about am on saturday morning the defendant pleaded not guilty to both charges captain robertson stated that on friday night he gave a lecture on air survey before the royal aeronautical society and subsequently in company with old friends he had paid a visit to a club in soho he believed as les trois homards he stated that it was impossible that he could have been intoxicated because he was able to maintain an erect position without assistance and in fact was dancing continuously from eleven oclock till one in the morning at the time in question he was on his way home with two or three companions when he was induced to lay a small wager that he would be capable of hanging by his toes from the crossbar of a lamppost for a period of five minutes a feat which he had repeatedly performed in england and abroad a lamppost situated just inside the park was selected for the purpose of the experiment which had been in progress for approximately two minutes upon the arrival of the constable who ordered him to come down the defendant in his statement continued to the effect that his feet then slipped owing to the fact that the toes of his evening shoes were of patent leather whereas he was accustomed to perform the feat in ridingboots by good fortune he fell on to the constable thereby saving himself from a serious injury a fine of five pounds with costs was imposed it didnt strike me as amusing at the time i sat there for a little in the gunroom thinking it over and then i went back again to my house lenden had dragged out an old atlas from the litter on the floor beside the safe and had opened it on the table at a map of germany he turned to me as i came in and put his finger on the page thats it he said noremburg its right in the middle i sat down on the edge of the table by his side are you going out there i asked he looked up at me in perplexity i dont know what to do i never thought of anything like this there was a little pause youll have to let that go i said gently touve got yourself to think about theres no possible way of finding out about his family short going out there yourself and you cant do that if going back to russia i believe i could find the house if i was out there he said vaguely i know the look of it quite well because he was always showing me the photos he had its out in the suburbs up on a little hill theres a watertower nearby that ought to make it easy to find you see he said somebodys got to go and tell them about it i began to see his point if things were left as they were that german family would never even know that keumer was dead the russians would never do any notifying of that sort especially in the circumstances all that keumers wife would ever know would be that the letters would stop coming and the money and then things would begin to run short halfrations as they used up their little funds and waited for the letters and the remittances that didnt come and for news theyd think it was the post for a bit said lenden its not very regular i stirred uneasily on the table youll have to leave it till you get back to kieff i said youll be able to get his address from the russians then and maybe youll be able to get the money that he ought to have had for the job and get it sent off to them he shook his head theyll freeze on to that there was a silence and then he said i dont know what to do not much catch going back there now itll be rotten out there without old keumer and if theres going to be a war or anything like that i nodded slowly i began to see it now keumer had been the only real friend he had in russia and now keumer was dead i hadnt realized before that that might affect lendens decision to go back i waited for a minute or two and then said your pal sam robertsons in london and i told him what i had seen in the papers he was only mildly interested hes doing damn well on that survey he remarked absently they all say so he asked me to go in on it with him but i couldnt i expect hes come home to buy machines any chance of a job with him he looked up quickly and stared at me across the table it was quite a new idea that there might be most likely hes all fixed up though still itd be damn good fun to get with sam again it sounds worth trying i remarked he dropped his eyes on the map i cant leave this infernal business like this he said morosely i left him to think it over then and went off to the farm to have a look at that foal i hadnt seen in the morning there was nothing to be done until he had made up his mind if that were possible for a man of his temperament whatever way he went now he couldnt do much harm to sussex and that was what i was chiefly concerned about what worried me now was the man himself i didnt want to see him make a muck of things and i didnt in the least want to see him cut off back to russia id got to like him quite a lot and yet if he decided to go i didnt see how i was going to stop him at lunchtime he asked me a whole lot of questions about the political situation i told him all i knew which was precious little things were very uncertain and there was every chance of our turning out the soviet what would happen if we did so i couldnt tell him he thought that over for a bit it was very evident that he was scared of getting caught in russia if there was going to be a breach with england i left him again after lunch and went down to the office i was tired and upset and i had a whole stack of work to get through before the quarter day i thought that if i settled down to clear some of it off it might stop me havering about this other business and i got out my files and ledgers in the intention of making an afternoon of it i never touched a pen it was quiet in the office the only sounds were the clicking of the footsteps and the giggling of the couples on the pavement below and the church clock chiming the quarters i sat there idle from a quarterpast two till four leaning forward on the desk my head in my hands my work was spoilt and to the best of my knowledge i was thinking of nothing at all after all id been up most of the night i say that to the best of my knowledge i had been thinking of nothing at all but at four oclock i reached out for the telephone and put in a trunk call to the phalanx club in knightsbridge it came in ten minutes or so i want to speak to captain robertson sam robertson of the argentine survey if hes in the club just one minute please there was a pause in a little while he came to the instrument this is robertson speaking who is that it was an unusual voice very soft and husky and deep i put him down at once as a thirteenstone man and leaned forward to the instrument prepared to lie confidently my name is moran i said peter moran good afternoon captain robertson afternoon there was a hoarse laugh im real sorry mr moran but im afraid at the minute i cant place you i laughed in return dare say not but youll have heard of my brother jack moran of stevenson and moran in buenos ayres shippers grain trade you know them i represent them on the baltic i know he was doubtful but making the best of it never done any business with them myself but i know of them glad to meet you mr moran yes im very sorry to disturb you on sunday afternoon ive got a long cable here from my brother that i want to come and talk to you about it means fixing up quick transport between buenos ayres and a place up in santiago where stevensons got an interest he grunted we run pretty frequently to rosario is it near there madreguello i said and for the spur of the moment i think that was a pretty good effort im not sure where it bears from rosario is this just occasional trips thats right now look here when can i come and see you sooner the better when its business im free all day tomorrow but for lunch ten oclock too early not a bit mr moran ill drop round to your office if you like dont worry im motoring in and ill be passing through knightsbridge at the phalanx then at ten oclock tomorrow morning right ill be pleased to meet you goodbye i rang off and sat for a little at my desk staring out of the window at the timbered house opposite ive always kept pretty well to myself and ive never gone about poking my nose into other peoples affairs but when you find a chap down and out and on his beamends it seems to me that the least you can do is to go and tell his friends about it for one thing it rids you of the responsibility for him i shut up the office soon after that and went back to my house for tea lenden had disappeared for the moment i had the wind up that hed vanished for good until i saw the pack of plates still lying on top of the safe where he had left it i knew that he wouldnt have gone away without those and i didnt think hed have gone away without telling me i spent an hour or two at the piano after tea running over the passages of my play i very soon became immersed in it and i dare say that i may have gone on for an hour or so without noticing very much and when i looked up in the end and glanced round the room there was sheila darle standing before the fire and laughing at me i dropped my hands from the piano and swung round im most awfully sorry i said i never heard you come in have you been here long she stood there on the fender in imitation of my owe habit with the laughter still bright in her eyes as she looked down on me about ten minutes or so whats that you were playing then i looked up and grinned at her a fairy tale she came a little closer to the piano whats it about i turned round again to the keys its a thing i take up now and again when ive nothing better to do ill play you a bit of it if you like she came and sat down on a little stool beside the instrument i played a few bars of the overture and stopped its about a princess who went walking in the forest alone i said and got chased by a bear and she ran away very fast which was about the best thing she could do in the circumstances and the bear ran after her and they ran faster and faster through the wood ill play you that bit till the princess really thought she was done for that time and then a woodman came along and killed the bear bit o luck that said sheila phlegmatically i nodded that sort of thing always happens in that sort of wood grimm and perrault you know like a conventional fairy tale you mean thats right i see that might be rather nice what happened then the woodman killed the bear with his knife and the princess was so grateful and she thought the woodman was such a heman that she fell in love with him and went away and lived with him in his hut in the woods under the trees is the sunlight it was always sunny there was she pretty very pretty as pretty as a picture that was nice for the woodman then said sheila demurely it was frightfully nice he liked it no end never had such a nice thing happen to him in his life before i should think i must say id kill a bear with a knife myself any day if i thought thatd happen and all the court and all the knights and squires and varlets riding through the woods to look for the princess but they didnt find her because she was in the hut with man she wasnt going to let herself be caught and taken away how long did she live with him weeks and weeks i dont think shed been very well brought up she hadnt she wasnt really a very nice girl but she was pretty and very much in love with the woodman so that part of it was all right but she didnt get on very well with cooking his dinner and emptying the slops and washing up and cleaning his boots she used to shirk that sort of thing a bit and then hed come in tired and all of a muck o sweat and see it wasnt done and hed buckle down and do her job for her almost every day hed have got on a lot better if hed given her a good spanking i know i agreed but she was a kings daughter you see and i expect he didnt like to do that but the result of it all was that he began to get more and more like a prince within the hut and she got more and more like a peasant girl because she was always shirking her job he got taller and straighter and handsomer and she got shabbier and shabbier because she hadnt any new clothes and the old ones werent standing the strain very well and at last they were just about as shabby as each other and it was perfectly obvious then when you looked at them side by side that he was a kings son and she was just an insignificant little person that hed picked up somewhere or other she laughed what happened then why i said they went back to the castle and got married and everybody said it was a very suitable match and they were all frightfully pleased about it and they went about telling each other what a good job it was because they thought she was never going to get off and now shed gone away and found such a nice young man all by herself and so well connected and they said he must be the son of the king of tenebroc and the princess whispered to him that that was eighteen months journey away and so he said well perhaps he was and so that was all right and they lived happily after is that all thats all ill play you some of it now she settled herself upon the little stool by the keyboard and i began upon the overture that evening stands out very clear and distinct in my memory even at this distance of time it came as an oasis an interlude in that rather trying period throughout that evening i was able to forget the whole affair aeroplanes espionage and everything for that interlude i was grateful at the time and i have seen more reason to be grateful since some time after that perhaps as much as an hour later lenden came in i had finished the play by then and was playing bits of things to her at random chopin mostly i think and we were talking lenden hesitated in the doorway i swung round and introduced him to sheila he shook hands vaguely i weve met before didnt you come over to look after me the other day she nodded him youre much better now arent you he hesitated yes he said quickly im quite all right again now it was awfully good of you to come over not used to people bothering like that he smiled shyly youre quite all right again yes fine well enough to come over to the house for supper with him she jerked her head at me he glanced at me inquiringly it sounds awfully nice she turned to me did you know that arner went up to curzon street this afternoon i shook my head surprised he didnt say anything about it to me she nodded i forgot to tell you with your playing it was in the afternoon when youd gone down to the office he got a telephone call it was that i came over to tell you about really theres only me and aunt maud she swung round on lenden laughing so you neednt be frightened youll come wont you both of you i grinned wed like to very much all right she said halfpast seven and went lenden had been out on the down above under he said that he had got fed up with the house and had gane out for a walk he had taken a dog with him that he bad found tied up in the stableyard it belonged to kitter the chauffeur kitter had been only too willing that the beast should get some exercise and lenden had gone wandering with his dog over the downs in the direction of leventer he told me where he had walked he had certainly covered a good bit of ground in the time and then he said i came up over a bit of a hill by a beech wood and saw my breguet about a mile and a half away she was covered up and pegged down in the lee of a barn did you do that i nodded youd see her from there its the only direction from which shes really conspicuous i thought about it for a minute well have to do something with her soon he agreed that she couldnt stay there indefinitely he told me that he had walked on over the down to have a look at her spadden was evidently sleeping in his house that sunday afternoon for lenden saw nobody shes quite all right he said i slipped off the cover from the oil filter and it was all bunged up with stuff from the inside of that bit of pipe its a rotten bit of stuff that pipe like garden hose all she wants is a new bit and the oil tank cleaning out i suppose theres eight or nine hours petrol in the tanks still might want her again yet he said uneasily itd be the easiest way of getting back to russia his walk had done nothing to resolve his mind i made no direct answer to that but presently i said ive got to go to town tomorrow he was silent for a minute how long are you going to be away for its only a morning appointment i ought to be back here by teatime any news of whats happening about russia i shook my head nothing at all he relapsed into silence again and presently to get ready for dinner it was clear to me by that time that he was quite incapable of making up his mind it was becoming more and more evident that he was reluctant to go back to russia i began to put considerable faith in the issue of this meeting with robertson it seemed to me that lenden was in such a state of dither that he would go passively in any direction in which he were pushed i had some hopes that robertson might provide the push we went over to the mansion that was a quiet evening one of a type that i had grown familiar with through the years that i had spent at under supper on sunday evening is always the same in that great candlelit room i trust it always will be there was a cold chicken a smoked tongue a potato salad a caramel pudding and a camembert and rather a good barsac beyond the candles the portrait of arners grandfather stared down at me from above the mantelpiece and i talked to lady arner about the garden and the tenants and mattocks foal which i didnt think much of mattock was a bit disappointed with that foal himself as a matter of fact and sold it over at pithurst the other day sheila had taken lenden in hand and was being very sweet with him he was shy and restrained to begin with i fancy but by the time we reached the sweet the barsac was at work and he was talking to her quite fluently about his joyriding experiences i overheard some of it ten days in one place he said and then move on just the two weekends however well youre doing it never pays to stay longer than that and its never any good to put on a special show on market day like youd think never do much business then just the saturday and sunday theyre the big days and little bits in the week i expect you get most people to come up at the big seaside places dont you inquired sheila places like bournemouth and brighton he vas entirely at his ease by now and intent on telling her about the work he loved in a way he said you can bam your fingers pretty badly there though theyre mostly worked out no we stick more to the little places now places about the size of pithurst and petersfield you have to leave them for so long to recover its never any good going back for four years thats the interval that you have to leave before you can do a good weeks business again four years he mused a little of course some places you can go back to year after year and still take up as many as you can manage clapton ive taken money there year after year and then some day well get bargate opened up sheila interposed a question does bargate go on and on he smiled shyly he had rather an attractive smile though i hadnt seen much of it since hed been with me but when he smiled i remembered him as he used to be in the service cant go to bargate at all he replied they wont look at an aeroplane now odare did that in for us why cant you go there wont they have you he shook his head corporation wont hear a word about it not since you cant get permission to use a field within five miles of the place not at any price theyre not going to have the reputation of their town blasted by a lot of flying men never no more i dare say theyre right he sighed regretfully id make a fortune in six months if i could get a field at bargate id be able to retire sheila was intrigued whats the matter with them what happened lenden hesitated it was a bad show he said shyly it happened just after the war odare was the first of us to go to bargate and it was a little gold mine i tell you he got a field there just at the end of the promenade by a bus stop he was flying a threeseater avro he only had the one machine and his ground engineer and a clerk and thered never been any joyriding in bargate before and the town was full of visitors and every day when the boat came in from london they simply made one stream for his field it was wonderful i believe he had a queue half a mile long from eight in the morsing till dark and the sole right for the place for the summer he was in the air for thirteen hours a day and in six weeks hed cleared his expenses and paid for the machine and banked two thousand pounds clear profit he was silent fer a minute what happened then asked the girl lenden smiled he took to shooting the bottles off the shelf over the bartenders head with his old service webley he explained in the hotel metropole where all the jews go it was a shame that happened and then oh then it all came to an end of course they ran him and his aeroplane out of the town next day and closed down the field and now if you so much as fly over bargate to take a photograph you hear about it afterwards from the town clerk he mused a little theres a mint of money to be made there he said regretfully its virgin ground i turned again to lady arner we had bee disease in pretty well every hive that year they used to come out on to the little ledge outside and die in shoals i remember that she was very worried that we might not be going to get any honey of our own that year and we talked bees and bee disease till the end of the meal and after supper in the drawingroom i played to them i should probably have been playing that evening in my own house if i had been there lady arner and sheila and lenden pulled up chairs before the fire to study seed catalogues or talk or go to sleep and i went over to the piano and sat for a little polishing the white keys and the rosewood before beginning i forget what i played that night the usual tilings i suppose a little chopin for myself a little schubert for sheila a little verdi for lady arner and incidentally one or two of the songs from butterfly lenden had got hold of one of bunyards catalogues and was talking fruit trees with lady arner she told me afterwards that he knew quite a lot about fruit trees and wanted to know more she was very much surprised when he told her that he hadnt got a garden of his own she knew nothing of his circumstances but she had thought from the way he was talking that he would have been a great gardener that was the manner of that evening and of a hundred similarities that i have spent at under at the end of it we left the house and strolled back to my place across the stableyard we went into the sittingroom and had a whisky i yawned got to get away before eight oclock tomorrow i remarked if im to be in town by ten im driving up i glanced across at him have you made any plans he shook his head im going to wait till tomorrow night i expect youll hear a bit more about russia up in town wont you i nodded should do if i see arner in that case i think ill wait till you get back i set down my glass and got up on my feet better take that dog of kitters out again i said hes getting as fat as butter and so we turned in it saves quite a lot of time to motor up to town from under i had breakfast at halfpast seven and got away in the morris by eight oclock it wasnt a bad sort of morning blue sky and clouds with a stiffish wind from the northeast i made pretty good time on the road and by ten minutes to ten i was rolling into knightsbridge as i had supposed robertson was a big man he must have stood six foot two and he was broad in proportion he had a tanned pleasant face but he looked as hard as nails and i judged that he would be a pretty tough chap to tackle if you got up against him on the whole i liked the look of him as he came across the lounge to meet me walking with a curious rolling gait i found out later that that was the legacy of a crash he greeted me in his soft hoarse voice strongly flavoured with americanisms gmorning mr moran im real glad to see you he moved away across the room come on over here theres a quiet corner where we can talk business we settled into a couple ef leather chairs now whatll you drink it was ten oclock in the morning i cried off that he laughed quietly well then about this business for your firm stevenson and moran i think you said for a moment i wondered if i was going to be kicked out of the place i must explain that a bit i said the matter that ive come to see you about is pretty confidential i didnt want to go into it over the phone theres no such firm as stevenson and moran not that i know of that was a yarn to get you to give me an appointment he turned a very grey eye on me see here he said without heat are you a drummer i grinned and shook my head im agent to lord arner down in sussex he looked relieved i reckoned that youd come to sell me something it didnt take me long to find that there was no such firm as stevenson and moran on the baltic ive not come to sell you anything i said but ive got business to talk all the same he settled down into his chair and offered me a very black and diseasedlooking cigar fire away he said biting the end off his own its about a man called lenden i said maurice lenden i think he was out with you in honduras i had startled him he paused in the act of taking the bit out of his mouth with finger and thumb and stared at me what about him he asked depositing the tobacco in an ashtray whats he like as a pilot there was a long pause at that now see here he said tt last if youre thinking of employing maurice lenden as a pilot ill tell you what i think of him i wasnt thinking of employing him as a pilot but i let him run on youll find him a real wizard pilot hes right out of the top drawer barring the float that he ripped up when we were up the patuca ive never heard of him doing the slightest damage to a machine maybe hes had luck in his forced landings but if you want a damn fine safe careful pilot for any job whatever then youve got the right man he paused thats as a pilot if you try to run him as a manager as well then your luckll be out and i tell you that straight hes a damn good fellow and straight as theyre made but he couldnt run a whelk stall to make it pay he cant manage his own affairs let alone a business hes a pilot and a pilot only and as a pilot hes right up in the front line but hes nothing more he turned to me curiously do you know where he is now hes down at my place in sussex is he out of a job hed probably take one if he could get it toure not thinking of employing him yourself then i shook my head i came to see if you knew of anything that he could do he was puzzled at that he turned and stared at me curiously i dont see that why didnt he come up himself did he send you to see me i blew a long cloud of smoke from that foul cigar no i said as a matter of fact he didnt i came up here on my own to see how the land lay i paused as a matter of fact hes been in a bit of trouble robertson raised his eyebrows i eyed him steadily in confidence i said you wont go and let him down he shrugged his shoulders its no business of mine what hes been up to but hes a good pilot and a damn nice chap and im sorry if hes in trouble that seemed good enough to me hes just back from russia i said by the back door hes been flying for the soviet for some time now theres nothing really wrong but the foreign officeld probably like to get him for a quiet talk before sending him to dartmoor for a bit he nodded slowly dyou know he said at last we reckoned it was something like that and was silent again after a bit he turned to me curiously i dont quite see how you come into it he said are you one of his wifes people i shook my head i came into it by accident but ive met him before in ninetytwo squadron in does he know youve come up here no whats his own idea then whats he going to do i shrugged my shoulders he talks about going back to russia robertson blew a long cloud of smoke and flicked the ash from his cigar on to the carpet doesnt sound as if thatd do him much good not the way things are at present i shook my head therell be a break with russia he glanced at me quickly dyou know that no its bound to happen sooner or later though and it wont do for him to get caught out there then no he said slowly by god it wont he turned to me does he understand that in a way hes very vague his trouble is that he doesnt see what else there is for him to do i laid the unconsumed portion of that appalling cigar upon the ashtray i understand that a year or two ago you offered to take him into partnership when you were starting in the argentine he told me that at that robertson leaned forward and began to talk he said that he wanted me to get this quite clear he didnt employ pilots as staff he only had one or two at the most he got them in as partners he wanted capital he was always wanting capital and he paid ten per cent for it his pilots had to operate away from him for months on end and unless they had an interest in the business he couldnt rely on the show being run properly when he was away if lenden could bring capital along with him say a thousand pounds he might be able to fix him up with a job although he would be no party to getting him out of the country lenden would have to meet him in the argentine you see bow it is with me he said im not a charity show for dud pilots if maurice lenden can come in on those terms i think hed be a damn good man for me if not theres others who can learn the job that offer that i made him two years ago you can tell him its still open i nodded right you are i said in the meantime wed better fix an appointment when i can have a look at your books oh he shot the ash from his cigar on to the carpet for a thousand i could find a thousand he glanced at me very curiously it was quiet in the lounge lendens got no money of his own at all not a bean he was working in a garage as a matter of fact before he got the russian job poor devil said robertson softly he glanced at me again still curious i dont quite see what you stand to get out of this ten per cent i replied better interest than im getting for the money as it is there was a long silence then robertson relaxed and lay back in his chair staring at the ceiling in a far corner of the room a couple of men began talking of the grand national and the odds they had been getting and at last he said you say youve not had anything to do with lenden since the war i was surprised by that question i didnt see what he was driving at no i said i hadnt met him since not till a few days ago hed be better on the survey than dines said robertson softly half to himself and dines could start in to work up the other side we want that just as much way things are opening up he turned to me you dont want to go putting money into a show like mine he said very frankly nor into any flying business for the next ten years youll only go and burn your fingers but by christ if youre willing to put up a thousand for him itd be a queer show if i couldnt do as much knowing him all these years he spat a bit of tobacco out on to his lip and removed it to the ashtray you can tell lenden theres a job with me in the argentine if he wants it he said i was giving him seven hundred when we went up the patuca together i cant run to that now fourfifty and a small percentage on profits ill have to reckon that out i nodded ill tell him thats very good of you robertson yawned reckon itll pay me in the long run hes a wizard pilot tell him to come up here and see me some time in the next week he ground the stump of that filthy cigar upon an ashtray and now what about a quick one it was little after halfpast ten but he ordered gin and tonic for us both and when it came heres luck he said and set down his glass have you met mrs lenden yet i wrinkled my brows mrs lenden he nodded mollie lenden but perhaps he hadnt told you he was married i shook my head he told he that he was divorced i said robertson went diving into the inner pockets of his coat and produced a sheaf of at least a dozen dogeared letters he laid this collection out upon his knee and picked out one it was a letter on thick pale blue paper addressed in an upright feminine hand he tossed it across to me thats all i know he said shortly i opened that letter and read it it was quite a short one ye tea shoppe winchester dear major robertson i expect youve heard from people how things are between maurice and me i dont know where he is now and nobody seems to know at all the last thing i can find out is when he left the atalanta when it bust and after that i cant find out anything about him or what hes doing or anything and i thought that hes sure to turn up in aviation soon because he loves it so and cant stay away from it and i thought if i wrote round to you and one or two of his other friends you could let me know as soon as you hear of him i read the flying papers every week please will you try and find out where hes gone to and let me know as soon as you hear anything at all i wouldnt have written to you like this but youve been so good to us all through that it seems different yours sincerely mollie lenden i sat there for a long time staring at this thing there was no subtlety in it no skill it was the letter i thought of a very ordinary girl who had lost something that she valued and was trying to find it again i remember wondering whether she was going to pull it off and then i thought of lenden and realized that whatever might be the outcome of it all this letter was going to turn the whole of his affairs upside down again i turned to robertspn i see she signs herself mollie lenden dyou know what happened about that divorce he shook his head thats all i know ive been in the argentine for the last two years that reached me about a week before i started home matter of fact id forgotten all about it till you mentioned him dyou say she was divorced i wrinkled my brows over it lenden certainly told me that he fixed it up so that she was able to divorce him but i see here that she still uses his name robertson wasnt greatly interested i expect they had a bustup and he cleared off for a bit he said phlegmatically best thing to do sometimes i thought about it for a minute what about the argentine i asked can he take her out there with him if she wants to go he set down his glass my wifes coming out there with me this time fed up with being out there alone but as for him i dare say they can do it he said the difficulty is the screw im giving him yes i think they might work it the way we live if theyre damn close not unless he picked up the letter and handed it to me will you take on this show now he asked youd better show him this and maybe hell go along to see her maybe he will i said absently its not far from my place robertson yawned tell him to give me a ring before he comes he said casually there was nothing more to be said or to be done and so i went away i got to winchester at about four oclock wishing vaguely that i was a clergyman they seem to have the knack of butting in adroitly i was very conscious that i hadnt it had seemed the only thing to do i retired to my club after i left robertson picked up a novel off the table as i passed into the smokingroom and sat there for half an hour trying to read it at the end of that time i turned back to the beginning and began again by the time i had got to page forty for the second time i had come to the conclusion that the only thing to do was to go down to winchester that afternoon and find out how the land lay having once started butting in i might as well go through with it the shop was in between the close and the main street in rather a quiet little byway at first sight one would not have known it for a shop at all it was a square uncompromising georgian house that stood directly on the pavement through the open windows of the ground floor one could see that the whole of the front rooms of the house had been knocked into one and were set with little tables a small brightlycoloured sign ewer the door announced the calling of that house and a little white notice on the door impressed upon me that it was under the entirely new management of mrs mary lenden homemade cakes it seemed were a speciality i got out of my car and went up the three steps into the big room among the little oak tables and stood there for a minute waiting for something to happen it was evident to me that the tea trade was slack in winchester on mondays it was after four oclock but i was the only person in the room and then there was a rustling in a back region not unlike somebody laying down the daily mail and a girl came out from behind a brightlycoloured curtain that hung across the back of the room good afternoon she said quietly can i get you tea i suppose she might have been twentysix or twentyseven years old medium in height and with brown hair that she wore long and dressed smoothly back over her head giving her a very quiet air she was dressed in a long white overall and i stood there wondering for a minute if she were the girl id come to look for she looked at me inquiringly my courage went trickling away through my boots and i ordered tea i sat over that for half an hour not many people came into the shop by halfpast four there may have been half a dozen in the room i was rather surprised at that because the tea was one of the best ive ever had the good fortune to sit down to mrs lenden knew her job all right so far as that was concerned i very soon came to the conclusion that it was mrs lenden that i had met as i entered there was another of them there a redhaired girl of about eighteen who seemed to do most of the running about it couldnt be her unless there were more of them behind the scenes mrs lenden must be the one that i had spoken to at first and then as she came through the curtain with a fresh supply of cakes to set on a little table by the wall i noticed what i suppose i should have seen before if id had any sense she wore a wedding ring that room faced the sun a wide airy place and not too crowded with tables there was a little jug of snowdrops before my plate and the sun came in throagh the window by my side and lit up these flowers and the light oak of the table and the bright mats upon it i nodded to her and she came over to tell me how mud i owed she stood beside me and cast a rapid over the table three cakes she considered a minute thatll be one and fivepence then i fished it out you are mrs lenden i suppose she nodded we havent been open for very long i took this shop over from the other people when they went away about six months ago did you know it then she was very grave and courteous and kind and she stood there eyeing me directly i shook my head ive never been here before but major robertson sent me down here he told me that id find you here you know him dont you sam robertson hes back from the argentine if i had expected to surprise her i was mistaken she showed no change but she nodded gravely major robertson is a very old friend of my husbands she said simply we know him quite well she wasnt giving anything away that girl i know i said i saw him this morning he gave me this and told me to come and see you and i pushed her letter across the table towards her a donkey cart passed slowly by the window in the street outside loaded with yellow bananas and red oranges and all manner of bright things in the sun she stood there fingering the letter and she was silent for a minute he gave you this she said at last then you know something about maurice hes staying with me now i replied hes hes quite all right i glanced up at her sharply and looked away again hes perfectly fit i said gently just had a touch of malaria thats kept him in bed for a couple of days but nothing to worry about hes quite all right now she nodded did he get his mixture made up and then as if she was ashamed to talk to me of trivialities she said you must come upstairs please if you dont mind we cant talk here she had recovered and seemed as impassive as she had been when she was giving me my bill that was a way of hers she never showed one very much of what she felt even when things were very difficult for her she took me to a room on the floor above looking out on to an uneven array of roofs and an untidy little yard at the back it was their sittingroom there were a couple of basket chairs and a low smouldering fire in the grate and a little writingdesk littered with accountbooks and loose bills half sittingroom half office this was evidently where they lived in the room she turned to face me whats your name im sorry my names moran i said i live over in sussex about forty miles from here i was in the same squadron as lenden in she wrinkled her brows i dont suppose youve ever heard of me i said i hadnt seen him since those days till last week youve come from major robertson she asked i nodded he sent me here your husbands in a bit of trouble mrs lenden i went to robertson because he seemed to be a pretty old friend and because he was handy in town she was quite collected now whats the trouble she inquired wheres he been there was no point in beating about the bush hes been in russia i said frankly and thats the trouble and then there was a sudden commotion on the stairs and there was the redhaired girl who said there was a party of four asking for poached eggs and there werent any eggs and should she send lizzie out for eggs or should she tell them that they couldnt have eggs and when that was settled and the commotion had died away downstairs again mrs lenden was silent for a little time and then i knew that was where hed been she said at last it was the only place and then she turned to me where is he now whats he going to do hes staying in my house for the present hes going back to russia tomorrow or the next day whys he going back there hes got a job out there i paused for a moment and then decided it was best to take that fence at once from his point of view theres nothing to keep him in england he hasnt any ties or anything you see i said gently he thinks hes divorced she dropped her eyes to the table i know she said quietly i know he does there was a little silence then she stood there with her eyes fixed upon the table and i followed her glance it was a heavy old refectory table backed up against the wall and as i stood there waiting for her to say something i took notice of what was on it stacked up against the wall there were great heaps of weekly periodicals i dare say there may have been a couple of hundred there of all shapes and sizes a few of them were scattered loose upon the table and i glanced at the titles and then i realized what i was looking at there was the aeroplane and flight and airways all three of the english ones then there were the americans the aerial age and aviation and the flying world and there was the aero revue suisse and lair and the illustrierte flugwoche and la rivista aeronautica and il ala dltalia and a whole heap of others in all languages she must have given a wholesale order to some agency and paid a mint of money to have every aeronautical publication in the world sent to her by post for months i could picture her sitting there at that table in the evenings surrounded by those papers that she couldnt read very grave and serious she saw what i was looking at and raised her eyes inquiringly i indicated them these papers i said youve been reading them every week she nodded with the redhaired girl to help her she had waded through the lot of them night after night for over a year she had let the girl deal with the english ones because they were easier while she looked for his name in the foreign journals line by line you see i knew hed turn up in aviation some time she said simply he loves it so its the only thing he can do really well and he cant keep away from it we tried giving it up before you know and it didnt work she hesitated thats what made me write to major robertson and the others because i knew that where there was flying mauriced turn up sooner or later i could find nothing to say to that she turned away and sat down at the littered desk she pulled out a sheet of notepaper from a pigeonhole if i write a little note to maurice she said gravely will you take it to him i nodded im going straight back home from here i said hell get it tonight she raked about among her papers till she found a little blunt stump of pencil and bent over the desk i sat down on the edge of the table and began to turn over a copy of aviation before i had looked halfway through that issue she had finished her letter and was sealing it deliberately in an envelope that must have been a very short note that she wrote to him and then she got up and stood there fingering the envelope for a minute he thinks were divorced she explained but we arent really and he ought to know oughtnt he because he might be wanting to marry again and he couldnt you see and so ive just told him that and what im doing and perhaps hell be able to come over and see me before he goes back do you think he will she stood there eyeing me gravely and a little wistfully why i said im sure of it mrs lenden she nodded you see we were going to be divorced she said and it was only when it all began that i saw what a rotten cheap sort of way out it was and how it wasnt going to work not properly it all depends on how youre made if you can get to be happy that way and icouldnt and it might have been different if hed been well off and had lots of money but he wasnt it was a rotten trick to go leaving him like that been most frightfully ashamed and then when i wanted to find him to tell him about it hed gone away her voice died into the silence but presently she began again a man isnt like a girl she said quietly thats what i didnt know and it was all my fault really a girl gets married and she wants a home and children and a quiet time and she puts all that first and she hasnt got much patience with anything else and i think a mans a bit like that too but only a bit a man gets keen on other things that dont seem to be any good at all and he goes and spends all his life on them even if they dont lead to the quiet time that he really wants even if he cant make enough money at them to live properly he wont give up i could find nothing to say to her she went on speaking half to herself its like a kid with its toys music or the sea or or flying a man has to have his toys and if you try and take them away from him you just kill him she stood there gazing at me from her quiet dark eyes i know because i tried it maurice was in the city for two years you know and all that time we werent half so happy as wed been when he was doing his own job even if it did mean that he was out of work half the time nothing like i nodded and she stirred a little beside me as if she had forgotten i was there and what i thought we could do she said practically was this ive got this shop now and its doing nicely and it makes quite enough to keep us both if it had to and what i thought was that maurice could go on flying and have this for his home and then when he was out of a job for a bit he could coffle back here and thered always be the shop to keep as you see before when he was out of a job there wasnt any money and that was so rotten for him but i thought fliat this way itd be all right her voice died away into a silence youll tell him about this wont you she said youre a great friend of his i cleared my throat ill tell him that i think its a good idea its just what would work with him you want lo leave him pretty free she was pursuing her own train of thought i dont want you to persuade him or anything she gazed at me steadily you wont will you because it wouldnt be fair and its awfully easy to persuade him into anything you must just tell him what youve seen here and tell him what ive been doing and why ive done it and tell him that if hed like to have a go at being married to me again i think it might work this time i nodded ill tell him that she dropped her eyes from my face with a little sigh and handed me the note then thats all i think she had a great presence with her that girl i paused for a minute before going downstairs youd better have my address i said she sat down at the little desk and took it down in her neat round hand then she accompanied me down through the shop and came out with me into the street to where my car was parked i got in and started up the engine youll tell him what i said wont you she said wistfully i know hell be most awfully busy and i expect hes got to get back to russia but id love just to see him before he goes ill tell him that mrs lenden i replied and then she stepped back from the car and i slipped in the gear and she was gone five lenden didnt return till half an hour after i came in he had been out all day with the dog from what he said i gathered that he must have been pretty well as far as south harting along the down because he described passing a big white house in the middle of the hills i put that down as beacon house where sir john worth lives and breeds his bloodhounds he must have been twenty miles kitters dog returned in a state of prostration and a good job too it doesnt get enough exercise that beast i let him have his dinner before i started theres no sense in expecting a hungry man to listen to reason and lenden was very healthily weary he spoke very little during the meal but he mentioned keumer once and it was clear that he was as far from a decision on that affair as he had been in the morning after dinner he left the table and flung himself down in a long chair before the fire and with his first words he gave me the opportunity that i wanted dyou hear anything more about russia in town he inquired i shook my head not a word i left soon after lunch but i saw your pal robertson this morning he took the cigarette from his lips and stared at me sam robertson where did you see him in knightsbridge i replied at his club what dyou go there for i crossed the room switched on the readinglamp and sat down on the musicstool before the piano bit of officiousness i suppose i said quietly cant think of any other reason he didnt speak you may as well know what i think about this thing i said for myself i dont care a damn what you do it doesnt affect me you can walk out of this place when you like tonight or next month and i dont suppose well meet again for some time ill get rid of that aeroplane for you but when you do go i honestly think youll be a ruddy fool if you go back to russia theres going to be bad trouble there and therell be hell to pay if youre caught out there then you can see that for yourself he brushed that aside i know all that but what did you want to go and see robertson for was it about me i went to robertson because i knew damn well you wouldnt go yourself i said not my business i know but thats what i did he thought about it for a minute what happened he inquired i filled a pipe and lit it before replying he ended by offering you a job on his survey i said at length and glanced towards him through the smoke at four hundred and fifty to start with plus a share of the profits he stared at me incredulously did he offer that on his own he did without wanting any capital put into the business not a bean he laughed he must have changed his mind since last i saw him then youve got to remember that his business has expanded since you saw him last i said it upset the whole applecart of his decisions once again he didnt say very much but he sat there conning it over for a long time id like to go with sam again he said at last a little uncertainly it was good of you to go and look him up for me i wouldnt have thought of it myself its a better show than going back to russia but i dont know that i can cut off and leave the job like this i might have told him there and then that his plates were spoilt i suppose but i didnt and then theres keumer and his wife he said i couldnt go shooting off to the argentine without getting that squared up somehow he turned to me dyou know i thought of some things today keumers got an uncle who keeps a retail grocery shop in mannheim in a pretty big way of business i believe we might be able to trace his wife that way as a matter of fact it was through that uncle that i found her in the end but that was much later he sat there dithering over his decisions i saw then very clearly that there was only one person in the world who could resolve his mind for him i suppose i had known it all along in a way there was one other thing happened up in town i said nervously and went fishing in the breast pocket of my coat whats that i passed his wifes letter to robertson over to him to read robertson gave me this after wed done talking business i remarked youve turned up at last you see i didnt watch him while he read that letter but swung round on the musicstool and began polishing the white keys and the dark rosewood of the piano with my handkerchief that piano stands beside me as i write and presently when i am tired of recalling those bad times i shall get up and i shall play a little to sheila before going up to bed with my three stiff fingers my playing will never be a patch on what it was in the days of which i am writing and that i think is the least price that i have had to pay for interference ive read that letter i remarked without looking at lenden robertson showed it to me he didnt make any comment and then i said i went on down there this afternoon and had tea he stared at me darkly oh you went to winchester i nodded he was about to say something but stopped did you see mollie he inquired she gave me tea and then i said id seen robertson and she gave me a note for you he blinked at me she all right i got up from the piano she looked pretty fit i said casually she was very anxious to see you before you go back and i dropped her letter on the table by his side ive got to go down to under this evening for a bit theres her note he took it in his hands and sat there fingering it and looking up at me how longll you be he inquired about an hour or so i suppose i said and left him to it i walked down to under i had to go down there some time and this was as good a time as any because i knew that i should catch the crowd i wanted all together there was an amateur dramatic show brewing gilbert and sullivan and because it was for charity they wanted the use of the hall without paying any rent i found them hard at it in the hall itself rehearsing and quarrelling and having a fine time generally i might have seen eye to eye with them in the matter of the rent if theyd been redhot in the cause of charity but their chief trouble lay in the allocation of their mythical profits between the costumier and the charity if they were to run to wigs by parkinson would there be anything left for barnardo i didnt see why parkinson should pouch the lot and so i told their secretary that they could hold their show in the street for all i cared but if they had the hall theyd pay for it having made myself quite clear on that point i stayed on for a bit and watched the progress of their rehearsal they were doing patience and young saven whose father kept the red bear in the market was playing some small part in the thing i liked young saven he had recently come out of the air force i think he had been one of the first batch of peacetrained recruits he had attained the dignity of two stripes before he came out and now he was opening a little garage at the back of his fathers inn we sat there smoking and gossiping for a bit then nitter the hairdresser joined us and with him came his brother now ive mentioned nitter before john nitter that is who keeps the hairdressing establishment in the levanter road and talks communism in the market on saturdays hes a nice little man and when he isnt talking communism hes breeding irish terriers or children theres no harm in john nitter and for a long time i was puzzled to see where he got his communist ideas from and then one day i met his brother and i knew they came from bradford originally i think john was older than stephen and left bradford some years before the war with a lung that required the comparative warmth of the south in that way the hairdressers shop came into being stephen on the other hand was clever and won scholarships eventually he passed on to oxford and as befitted the son of a fitter in those less tolerant days he went to ruskin i dont know what happened to him in the war he never got into the army i know that much and he never married he was industrial to the backbone a little short tubby man in a bowler hat and a shiny black suit he had very light blue eyes and he wore his hair rather longer than one would have expected i saw him on a platform once it was in hyde park and he spoke without a hat and his hair fell down over his eyes and he kept shaking it back as he put the whole impact of his nature into his tirade and when i heard him then i forgot that he was a tubby little man there was the inspiration that brought john nitter to the market every saturday afternoon but i can vouch for this that john wasnt in the same street with stephen whatever he might have been ten years before living in the south had done it i suppose that and the lotus stephen used to come down to under about once in six months to stay with john partly for a holiday and partly i think to ginger up his brother i expect john needed a bit of gingering up from time to time the revolution wasnt getting on very fast in our part of sussex evening nitter i said to john you acting in this thing he shook his head no sir he said and got a scowl from stephen for his deference ah could have had a part in t chorus if ahd a mind but its a game for tyoungsters he sucked his pipe dyou know my brother stephen mr moran i shook hands weve met before i said you down here for a holiday mr nitter he stared at me uneasily he was shy and difficult to get on with was stephen all edges and rough corners ay he said morosely for a holiday just the three days and im for the north again i wouldnt stay longer than that i took him up why not the south he said was a playground i must condense his ideas into a practicable space for they dragged out in little short dark sentences interminably the south was where rich men came to live capitalists who had made their money by the sweat of the workers in the north a capitalist only needed to work in the north for ten or fifteen years and then having made a fortune from the labour of the workers he came down into the south to get away from the reminder of his own misdoings and to spend his money im no good at arguing with those chaps i couldnt refute this slander because in cold hard fact a certain amount of it was true a lot of industrialists retire to the south when theyve finished their lifes work in the north because its the best part of england to retire to its like a garden this place he said sullenly it all runs that smooth and soft and rich an up there where ah come from theres the workers sweating in the factories in the halfdark and the rain and never to see the sun clear for the skys that mucky he eyed me dourly conditions what youve never dreamed of you come up north and ahll show you something i grinned at him youd better go to russia if you want to see what sweating is i said i suppose he had stung me up a bit or i wouldnt have said that to provoke him youve never seen anything in the north to touch what you get out there you dont want a revolution to put that right i had annoyed him very much i knew that it was his dearest ambition to visit russia to be able to say that he had been there would give him a cachet in the counsels of his union and raise him from the ruck thats not true he said hotly you dont know nothing about it you living soft and easy as you do ahm for russia in two or three days from now and ahll find a better and a more hopeful world for the worker in that country a better and more hopeful world he repeated the words as if they were a quotation and the time will come the time will come when well see that better time in england and ah pray to god that ahll be spared to see it i eyed him for a minute you wont expect me to agree with you about that i said but apart from politics this is a damn bad time to go to russia you know there may quite well be a break you want to be careful what youre letting yourself in for i had a vague recollection of having said that before quite recently yere wrong he cried passionately yere all wrong this is the time when every thinking man among us ought to go to russia your capitalist government theyre slighting and insulting russia every way they know and for why because russia sticks up for the worker thats what it is well the workers must unite itls us that counts weve got no quarrel with the russians they stuck to us like brothers in the strike like brothers this is the time when every worker in england and in scotland and in wales has got to stick to russia and ahm away to tell them so i nodded slowly i had no arguments to meet this chaps sincerity you want to be careful you dont get caught out there if there is a break was all i said get clear in time ah he said rudely yere talking nonsense and ye know it but its always the same with you rich folk he paused ye wont see whats going on under yer own eyes with that he turned on his heel and walked off john gave me an anxious uncomfortable look i grinned back at him and he hurried off after his brother i fancy stephen was a bit of a trial to john at times especially in the red bear i left soon after that and walked back to my house lenden was still sitting there in that chair before the fire but the fire was practically out and the room was filled with the smoke from his cigarettes i stirred him up about the fire with a few winged words and he got down on his knees to make it up a little apologetically he said that he had forgotten all about it i threw off my overcoat and went and sat down at the piano whatll we have i inquired spot o sugar he stared at me uncomprehendingly no i said absently all right spot o chopin then and i played him a couple of mazurkas and when i had come to an end of that i glanced at him and he was sitting there exactly as he had been when i first came in and i thought he was asleep and i swung round on the stool and i said you can have the morris if you want her tomorrow i shant be using her myself he stirred in his chair thanks he said quietly i was going by train ive been looking up the trains in your timetable but it means going by portsmouth and southampton to get there youre quite sure you wont be using the car i shook my head im going to london again ive got some insurance business to get through up there but i got sidetracked on to this thing of yours this afternoon sorry he hesitated i was going to pinch the car as a matter of fact and run over there this evening he said and then i thought itd be better not to go over there so late and itd be nicer if i went over there after breakfast he paused and then be said whats the shop like she was always wanting to have a shop like that its not a bad place i said theres two of them there that i saw shes got a redhaired young woman in to help her run it and then i started in and told him everything that i had done or said so far as i could recall he heard me to the end in silence and then with only the briefest excuse he got up to go to bed he made some remark to the effect that he was tired i remember and i remember that he paused in the doorway for a moment this puts all the russian business in the cart again he muttered i dont know what the hells going to happen about that then he was gone i played a bit of my own stuff sat there idly for a quarter of an hour kicked the fire to the back of the grate and followed him to bed an early breakfast suited us both next morning i was aiming to catch the myself before i left i went out with leaden to the stable to make sure hed got the hang of the morris he started her up and got in he was wearing my ulster and my driving gloves he nodded to me from the car see you this evening then he said and with that he swung her round and out of the yard gate on to the western road to petersfield and he put his gloved hand up in salutation as the car shot up the road and so he drove away out of my life and on to meet his wife and all the promise that she held for him i only saw him once after that i had meant to go to town but as i turned back from the stable to my house they came to fetch me to the telephone in the mansion a cowhouse in one of our farms out by leventer was blazing merrily and it was up to me to go and see that they did something about it it was the usual sort of thing a chimney in the farmhouse first they hadnt worried about it in fact they were rather pleased than otherwise when it happened it saves sweeping the chimney if you have a little fire in it to burn away the soot that went on while they were having breakfast and thinking no evil till a lump of redhot soot fell on a little stack of straw and then half the outbuildings went up we got it in hand by eleven oclock and then i went on with the farmer into pithurst to see the insurance agent about the claim by the time i got back to under it was three oclock i might very well have given up the idea of going to town that day but when i got back to the office my clerk showed me a telephone message from lenden that had arrived about an hour before he wasnt coming back that night unless i wanted the car in which case i was to ring up a number in winchester otherwise hed be over first thing in the morning i told the clerk to ring up and tell him he could have the car for as long as he wanted it he could have had a second honeymoon in it for all i cared there was the little talbot belonging to the mansion which nobody ever used except myself when the morris was in dock and apart from that there was the siddeley there didnt seem to be much point in stopping in under and so i went up to london that afternoon and put up at my club that gave me the whole of the next morning clear for my business and i reckoned to catch an afternoon train down again if i didnt get away from under while i had a chance i thought thered be another fire or a cat d kitten or something and id have to stop and see to that i had a certain amount of luck next morning and went on to curzon street for lunch to report progress to arner he told me that things in connection with russia were still very bad he didnt think that the evidence in the machine that had been shot down had been worth very much there was little direct evidence to connect it with the soviet he was of the opinion that the break would not come at once but on the next opportunity things were getting very difficult especially in regard to arcos where all sorts of fishy work was going on he thought that arcos would be able to provide all the material that was necessary to make a breach with russia if that were considered necessary i gathered from the way in which he spoke that espionage had sunk rather into the background i wasnt sorry about that it gave far more chance for lenden i left curzon street at about halfpast two and took a taxi for waterloo there was a train down at threefrfteen i went to the timetables on the platform to verify that it stopped at petersfield theres always a bit of a crowd about that board and while i was looking at the list i felt somebody press in beside me and somebody said theres a luncheoncar as far as exeter and after that it seems to stop everywhere between exeter and instow and a girls voke said oh lor cant you find one that doesnt i wasnt paying much attention because one never does in a crowd like that but as i stood there following the figures in the list it seemed to me that i had heard the first voice before quite recently and i glanced back over my shoulder it was mackenzie the young pilot with the fair sandy hair who had flown the nightjar from gosport he was dressed in mufti and he had a girl with him even younger than he was himself he was pressed close up against me and without reflecting i nudged him with my elbow he turned to me and i was pleased to see him afternoon mr mackenzie i said amicably i think weve met before i paused my name is moran the crowd came surging round us jamming us more closely together his face was chalkwhite but whether it had been as white as that before i cant say he forced his way backwards out of the press and i followed him are you from under hall he asked and there was something in his tone that shook me rather im the agent there i said quietly he seemed about to say something impetuous but stopped i became aware of the girl who had pressed close up against his side and was holding his hand regarding me anxiously look here he said with evident restraint whats the matter what the hell do you want with me i eyed him steadily for a moment i think he must have been on the very edge of a breakdown that day deadwhite face blue eyes and sandy hair that sort takes things very hard nothing at all i said its pure chance that you got shoved against me there pure chance he repeated scornfully he dropped his eyes to the girl and smiled at her i told you it was no damn good going away theres no place where one can get shut of it the girl looked up into his face and i saw her squeeze his hand its quite all right she breathed this is just an accident they stood there for an instant very close together in comrtion defiance of the enemy myself god damn you i he burst out suddenly and shook her off get along back to under where you belong and then to the girl come on he said lets get along out of this he swung round and went off up the platform the girl cried alan after him but he never turned she hesitated for a moment and decided she must say something to me im so frightfully sorry she said he hes not quite himself i nodded i know thats perfectly all right she was going off after him but she stopped dead at that and came back to me what do you mean by that how much do you know about it i hesitated in my turn and then i know he shot down a machine the other night under orders i replied he was fifty yards away by that time walking with his head down among the crowd he stopped for a moment and looked back the girl stared at me most urgently tell me was it fair i didnt understand what she meant oh was it a fair fight hes so frightfully upset because he says it it wasnt he says all the time that it was just murder in the bustle of the crowd it seemed to me that there came a little pause at that as though all the world were waiting for my answer she had courage that girl im afraid the other fellow wasnt armed i said he hadnt got a gun in that way it was very easy for him she stared at me wideeyed for a minute i see she said thanks for telling me and then she turned and ran off up the platform after him and i stood there watching till i saw her take his arm and they went away together i turned away depressed and went and found a corner seat in the train and then as i opened my evening paper at the middle page i got a shock there was half a column of it and it began butler shot outrage in a sussex mansion under hall the residence of lord arner a historic mansion prettily situated near the oldworld village of under in west sussex was the scene of a violent affray early this morning when mr albert sanders butler in the mansion was shot in the shoulder in an endeavour to detain a burglar mr sanders is understood to be in a serious condition it is understood that the outrage occurred in the stewards house a building situated at a short distance from the mansion and normally occupied by mr peter moran agent to the estate in the absence of mr moran it is presumed that mr sanders entered the house and surprised a burglar who shot him and escaped by the open window the shot was heard by several of the employees of the house who rushed in and found mr sanders lying on the floor of the sittingroom the assailant made good his escape there were several paragraphs more of it but no more news they gave a little bit about sanders another little bit about myself and a condensed biography of lord arner i had plenty of time to think about it while the train meandered down to petersfield and i cannot say that i found my reflections very pleasant there was only one possible explanation of it that i could see there was only one possible thing in my rooms worth burgling the house for only one thing that could possibly involve the use of firearms it was only then that it came home to me what a ruddy fool id been about those plates id left them sculling about where anyone could see them thinking that they were harmless now that id exposed them the upshot of it was that some russian organisation had got wind of the situation and paid me a visit to collect their property i was dead certain that that was what had happened sanders had blundered in upon them by chance attempted to defend my property and theyd let fly at him i cursed myself most bitterly for all sorts of a ruddy fool not to have foreseen something of this sort i might have known that to hang on to that box of plates was simply asking for it i got down to petersfield at about five oclock and kitter was on the platform there to meet me i swung out of the carriage and gave him my case hows sanders i asked doin fine sir youve heard about it then i nodded is he much hurt they shot him through the shoulder sir he touched his shoulder to show me exactly where the bullet had gone in it went in here and came out at the back sir doctor armitage said it was providential it wasnt higher up sir or itd have bust his shoulderblade it do seem a terrible thing to happen and nine oclock o the morning in england do you know how it happened he shook his head not rightly the safe was all shut up when we went in i dont know as they had time to pinch anything i think mr sanders surprised them in your room like and then they shot at him and mrs oliver was out in the yard near the door and she heard the shot and she heard mr sanders cry out and she called to me and i got watson because he was just in the garden there and he brought a fork with him and we went into your house and the window was open and mr sanders on the floor sir and then we telephoned for the doctor but i dont know what wed have done but for the lady she put him to rights before the doctor came an got him up to bed an that and hes going on quite all right sir i wrinkled my brows what lady is that i forgot to tell you sir shes waiting to see you when you get back that gentleman whats been staying with you his wife mrs lenden thats right sir they arrived together in your car not a minute or two after we found mr sanders and long before the doctor came and the lady knew just what to do and she and mrs richards bound him up a treat with bandages and all and then the doctor came and the police and sanders told them what had happened but i wasnt there then only mrs richards and the gentleman and his wife and then we got sanders up to bed and a little while after that the gentleman went away in your morris sir dyou know where he went to yes sir he was going to dover and he was in a great hurry i filled up the morris with four gallons sir and lent him a couple o maps he paused and then he said the ladys at your house now sirwaiting to see you i stood for a moment on the platform the train had steamed away down the hill to portsmouth and i was the last passenger to leave over the downs the sun was going down from where i stood i could trace the hogged line of the hills from butser to south harting beyond that lay my own country and i didnt know what i turned to the siddeley wed better get along back there then i said and pretty quick he made that car move faster than shed ever gone before along the road to under and he got there long before i had time to make my plans the car swung round the gatepost on two wheels and came to rest in the yard ill see sanders first i said to hitter if hes awake i went into the house by the back a maid that i met in the passage told me that mrs richards the housekeeper was sitting with mr sanders in his room she had heard that mr sanders was getting on nicely and had had a little sleep during the afternoon it was a terrible thing she said and she hoped i wouldnt find anything taken papers or that and not as if he was a young man neither i went on upstairs he had a little sittingroom of his own in the servants wing with a bedroom opening out of it both were furnished very profusely in the victorian manner with furniture that i think had once graced the house and had been turned out to make room for older stuff or newer an ornately framed photograph of a forbidding old woman who had been his mother hung above his bed in the sittingroom there was a brightlycoloured oleograph of king edward and queen alexandra at their coronation mrs richards was sitting by his bed and reading the leading article in the morning post to him aloud with long pauses of noncomprehension between the sentences i heard them at it as i came upstairs he had his own copy of the morning post every day a perquisite that i had not dared to curtail when i took over the reins after the war i dont think he has ever read anything else except possibly the bible countrybred gardeners boy footman valet and finally to butler it makes a difference mrs richards got up as i entered and began to talk i let her run on for a little and then moved up to his bedside i dont know how old he was but old enough to be very badly shaken by a thing like that his flannel nightgown had had one sleeve cut off and the arm was bandaged closely to his body i said the usual things that one does say at a time like that he was as comfortable as they could make him in the circumstances but he was in for a bad night of it they had sent for a nurse from portsmouth and were expecting her very soon they said sanders himself was pretty cheerful i was relieved by the way he greeted me he wasnt very badly hurt and then i asked him how it happened and he looked about him for a little without speaking and finally he said something inconsequent i divined what he wanted and sent mrs richards on a vain errand he said that he had gone over to my rooms with a bottle of whisky in his hand to fill up my decanter the window was open wide sir and there was two men there one of them just outside the window and one right inside the room right inside they must have come in through the kitchen garden from the lane and then through the little green gate the only way they could have come sir i nodded did you recognize either of them that brother of nitters was one sir the one outside not the one that had the pistol but the other one i didnt tell that to the police sir seeing that it touches the town and thinking that i should rightly tell you before saying anything but thats one of them he had barely given a glance to him the other man he said had rather a fat white face and was taller and broader than nitter he had a brown soft hat on he was standing by the safe and as he entered sanders saw him pick up something black one of your books from the safe or something of that sir he said a black one and rather fat would that be anything important i shook my head slowly it sounds like the cashbook i dont think thatd do them much good sanders had made some exclamation as he entered the man who was inside the room whipped round at that and made for the window taking the black packet with him nitter was already outside and then old sanders who had lived all his life in under and found london a confusing place and terribly expensive acted promptly and with decision the man with the fat white face was at the window when sanders lifted the whisky bottle that he was carrying and flung it straight across the room with all the force of his old arm it hit the chap on the shoulder cannoned heavily off his head and burst against the wall sanders ran forward to grapple he never saw the man draw his gun he only knew that two shots were fired and he was sure it wasnt nitter something went singing past his ear in an explosion and another crashed through the soft part of his shoulder and then he said naively i seemed to get one foot in front of the other sir and i fell down he stayed down till kitter and watson came bursting in a minute or two later and found him on the floor i gave mrs richards the key to the silver cupboard sir he continued and theres eight dessertspoons and four tablespoons in the lefthand drawer in the pantry and a teaspoon in miss sheilas room what she has for her medicine and i told arthur that when he lays the table this evening hes to go to mrs richards and shell give him the silver out of the cupboard and hes to take it straight back to her when its washed and no nonsense and then theres the teapot what was used for breakfast that will be in the pantry on the shelf unless mrs richards thought to lock it up with the rest ill see her about that when i go down i promised him i stayed up there with him for a quarter of an hour longer listening to his instructions about the silver and the wine he insisted on giving me the key of the cellars i could have left him much earlier but well i suppose it comes to this that i was shirking waiting in my house was the girl that i had met in winchester and i was afraid to go and meet her i realized that at last and went downstairs there was nobody about in the mansion i dont know what happened to lady arner that day i suppose she was keeping to her room arner himself was up in town and sheila had gone off early in the morning to visit friends in hornsea and was still away i went out of the mansion into the yard and crossed over to my own house and there was mrs lenden in the sittingroom by the window she had turned on the readinglamp by the piano and she was sitting on the the gloom outside the circle of light i do not think that she can have been doing anything at all but wait for me i crossed the room to her good evening i said id have come over before but i went up to see sanders they told me that you were here she inclined her head gravely theyve told you all about it i think ive probably heard most of it i replied all but one thing that i dont quite follow wheres lenden gone off to she didnt answer at once he left a letter for you she said he wanted to do that because he was a bit worried about taking your car away again without asking there it is on the table i took it up it came in an envelope and gummed down i stood there fingering it for a minute but i didnt open it at once and while i was hesitating there the girl got up from the windowseat and came over to me by the table do you know what it was that they stole she asked i moistened my lips the plates i suppose she nodded that was it maurice told me about it last night the whole thing everything that he told you and he told me all about whats happened since hes been here youve been most frightfully good to us mr moran to us both i cleared my throat that doesnt matter i said at last and i was startled for the moment by the strangeness of my own voice she shook her head but it does matter you dont see it but it matters frightfully it was because you were so decent to him that maurice stayed here after the first day when he was ill if it hadnt been for that hed have gone straight back to russia directly he was well enough to travel and the plates would have been there by now and developed and everything i couldnt have found anything to say to her then in any case but i didnt want to say anything the less i said the better until i had heard the whole of what she had to tell me and so i stood there looking at her dumbly and she thought that i was embarrassed at her praise and she smiled a little to make me feel less awkward even at such a time she could do that its because you were so frightfully decent to him about it all that weve got just the one chance to put it right she said i nodded slowly i see i muttered and stood there fingering the letter she went wandering in her narrative and i didnt dare to recall her to the point one reads about spies in books and things she said absently and it all seems unreal not the sort of thing that could possibly happen in ones life and then well it does she raised her eyes to mine maurice didnt think about being a spy she said honestly i know he didnt all he ever thought about was the job the flying and whether hed be able to keep his course all right and how hed be able to find out what the wind was doing and what height hed have to be when he let off the firework and whether a thousand pounds was the right fee for all that night flying and what hed have got for a series of long night flights like that if it had been in england you see its his profession and its all he thinks about its its the only thing he lives for really she paused for a minute and then she began again i know him so well ive helped him so often with his plans for long flights like that i used to sit and write down things for him in the evenings when he was plotting his route on maps and things and i used to make little lists of things that he mustnt forget to tell the mechanics in the morning we used to do everything like that together and so you see i do know honestly he gets so keen upon a job and he does his job so well for its own sake that he forgets about the rest of it i said something then i dont know what at all events she didnt heed it do you know what we came over here for this morning she inquired to get those plates back again and then he was going to expose them i think she may have thought from the expression on my face that i didnt understand her you know its an awfully quick plate because it was for using at night its quite easy to spoil a plate like that and ruin the picture on it youve only got to take it out of the case and expose it to the light for ever so short a time and its done for i know because i used to have a kodak once and i spoilt some and maurice says its just the same with plates as it is with films i crossed over and kicked the fire up into a blaze you were going to do that this morning i inquired it was the shortest the most noncommittal thing that i could find to say she nodded we talked it all over last night at winchester you see she glanced up at me wistfully we couldnt possibly let those plates go back to russia its not the thing to do maurice saw that for himself just as much as i did it only wanted someone to put it to him there was a little pause at that it wanted you to put it to him i said i cant say that i had much success i really think that was a new idea to her i suppose thats true she said and then she went on to tell me how they had driven over from winchester after an early breakfast and had arrived not five minutes after the burglary had taken place it was rotten luck that she said quietly if wed only been just a minute or two earlier this wouldnt have happened you see we were going to expose the plates at once directly we got here maurice thought itd be a good place if we were to lay them out on the windowsill for a minute or two she turned vaguely towards the curtained alcove this windowsill bad luck i said there was a long silence after that i broke it at last with the inquiry that i knew the answer to wheres lenden then did he go off after them she nodded dumbly he wanted to she said a little pitifully he said he couldnt possibly let it go like that and he said he knew which way theyd be going she pulled herself up and stated at me gravely i think it was the right thing to do she said its a damn risky thing to do i said practically wheres he gone to she had quite recovered her control hes told you in his letter i think its somewhere between france and italy its the same way as he went to russia when he went out there first of all i glanced furtively at my wristwatch there was still lashings of time to catch the havre boat but by this time he would be in paris he had an eight hours start i ripped open the letter it was written in pencil on some sheets torn out of one of my ledgers with the cash lines running down the edge i suppose that was the only paper he could find being in a hurry i have that letter beside me now dear moran mollie will be able to tell you all about whats happened here its those plates i took of portsmouth somebodys pinched them i expect theyre in with the communists here or something and theyve shot up your butler and im terribly sorry that happened old boy im pushing off now to dover to get the boat there i think those plates are on their way to russia and theres only one way that they can go the way i went you go first to the casa alba by lanaldo thats a bit off the track but its the clearing house and they tell you which way to go from there and they fax you up with a new passport the villagers reckon its smuggling across the french border and they do a bit of smuggling to keep up the blind but its the clearing house really all the funny business goes that way since the kleunen show i want to get to the casa first and spill a line of innocence before the plates arrive then when they come ill be quids in anyway enough to get my fingers on the plates with any luck after that i dont mind if they do blot my copybook for me because itll be worth it now im taking your car to dover ill leave it in your name at the nearest garage i can find to the boat and say youll call for it in a day or two youd better bring the registration book with you to claim it and now theres just one other thing ive fixed things up with mollie all right and i want to say thank you for your share in that if this show goes all right well probably have a go at being married again whichll be just what the doctor ordered and if it doesnt mollies got enough money to get on with now and then theres the shop but what we fixed up last night was that wed do in these bloody plates lend let the soviet whistle for me and we thought wed go out to germany pretty soon together and wed run it as a second honeymoon and wed hunt up old keumers wife and make her a present of the thousand because i know shell be on the beach and id like to do that for the old lad mollie knows all i do about where to find her if anything goes wrong in this show id be most awfully glad if youd try and do something about that for me because its the only thing outstanding really except for a fiver that i owe morris of the rawdon aircraft company and you might see that he gets it and i think thats all thanks a lot for putting me up like youve done and all the rest i wish to hell i was well out of this but you see mollies point of view and itd be pretty rotten for her having me about the place without this thing being squared up ok yours truly m t lenden i stood there staring at the last page of this letter long after i had read it through i was afraid to look up i suppose by this time he would be in paris the havre boat was the next so far as i remembered it left southampton at about eleven oclock that would mean reaching paris about ten oclock in the morning but by that time he would be in marseilles or modane or however it was he went he was going out hell for leather in order to spill a line of innocence before the plates arrive there was no possible chance of catching him that way and then i knew that mollie lenden had seen that i had finished the letter and i must say something to her hell be in paris now i remarked it was the only thing that i could think of to say i expect hell be catching a night train on from there she nodded i expect so she said absently hell get out there tomorrow afternoon to this place in italy thats what he said and then she turned to me what was it that he took photographs of she asked do you know in the grate the fire was dying very red it was of portsmouth i said it was something at the entrance to the harbour but i dont know what it was she eyed me wistfully for a moment till i knew what she was going to say its most frightfully important isnt it there was only one way in which i could have answered that i dont know what it is i said again but it was important enough for them to shoot down the next machine that came over to repeat the job in the red glow from the dying fire she inclined her head her lips quivering i would have left her to herself then but it seemed that the least that i could do now was to assure her of the urgency i know she said at last that was mr keumers machine they went so far as that i said just murder because he hadnt got a gun to answer with that wasnt done for fun you know she had her eyes fixed on my face i know she said quickly i know it wasnt i had only half my mind on what i was saying to her i hadnt got a passport i hadnt been abroad since just after the war and it had lapsed years ago i knew that one could get into france without a passport by taking a cheap dayreturn ticket but not italy to get a passport meant at least a mornings delay in london it meant that i couldnt start after him till midday tomorrow i should be twentyfour hours late at least and suddenly she startled me with a question youre agent here arent you her voice was clear and strong again i nodded does that mean that you look after the land and the people in a way i replied the farms and the rents and things like that repairs and a bit of stockbreeding and any building thats going on ive got a finger in most pies in this part of the country do you know the country very well i couldnt imagine what she was driving at pretty well i said this part of sussex i was bred here out past leventer my father was a doctor there she eyed me for a minute and then she said well youre countrybred what did you think of maurice when he told you what hed been doing that came as a complete surprise i was still thinking about that passport as a matter of fact why nothing very bad i replied i dont know that i thought about it much not till he told me himself what was the matter with him and then i thought she stared at me what was it that he told you i had let myself into that blindly thinking of other things i could see no way out of it now but to tell her the truth it wasnt much i said gently it was just that he hadnt got a stake in the country he hadnt got a home to go to or a wife and kids or anything like that that was when he thought he was divorced you see and so he thought it didnt matter a damn what he did she had gone very white one has to put oneself in his shoes i said slowly its different for me and i think its different for you ive got this place and my job in this part of the world and my friends and youve got your shop and your home and winchester little things but what else would you call patriotism just being fond of the little things youve got at home and that you dont want to see changed a house with a bit of garden that you can grow things in and a dog or two and all the little inconveniences and annoyances that you couldnt really get along without thats your patriotism and thats all theres in it and thats what lenden hadnt got she didnt speak i glanced down at the letter i was still holding it in my hand those blue redlined leaves from the ledger and now i said youve gone and given him back his patriotism i bit my lip and turned away towards the window i knew then what id got to do the only thing that i could possibly do to put this thing right it was only a fifty per cent chance at the best but it was one that i had to take i stood there for a minute staring out into the darkness beyond the window and trying to master my cold feet and for that reason i kept my back turned to her and then i heard a little noise behind me and i swung round she was crying it was time that came i thought she had buried her face in her arms against the mantelpiece and she was crying there quite quietly i can remember that i wished to god that sheila was at home i let her carry on for a bit hesitating irresolute by the window at last i crossed the room and presently i touched her on the shoulder i wouldnt cry like that if i were you i said as gently as i could theres nothing to cry like that for you know its only that hell be away for a few days longer till this things cleared up i suppose it was a silly thing to say but she raised her head and began dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief and then you dont understand she muttered wearily its me thats been such a beast hed never have gone out there at all if it hadnt been for me and none of this would ever have happened and now theres this its so frightfully dangerous and i let him go just as hed come back home he wouldnt have gone if hed thought i didnt want it she dropped her head down to the mantelpiece again if those plates get back to russia therell be hell to pay i said i had caught her attention i know she muttered i laid my hand upon her shoulder and she stood up theres nobody else in the whole world that stands a better chance of putting this thing right i said its up to him hes the only englishman that has the entrйe that can get access to expose those plates now you see that dont you she had her eyes fixed on mine yes she said quietly i see that i dropped my hand from her shoulder well i said there you are its a damn fine thing that hes up to and a thing that you can be proud of hes the only man who has the power to put this thing right now and hes gone out to do it i dont reckon thats a thing to cry about and then i heard a car in the yard outside and from the beat of the engine i knew it was sheila in the little talbot and i can remember that i was very thankful i smiled down at mrs lenden theres a friend of mine outside i said a girl im going to send her in to you and shell take you somewhere where you can wash your face and blow your nose and i wouldnt cry any more not if i were you i left the house and went out into the yard sheilas car was there standing beneath the stable lantern on the wall the headlights made two narrow pencils of light out into the darkness of the garden i crossed the yard to her evening miss darle i said im afraid weve had some trouble here i told her briefly what had happened in the dim light from the lantern on the wall she listened to me in silence till i came to the part about lenden going off to italy then she broke in do you mean to say that hes gone off to italy to get those plates back she inquired and in the halflight i saw her brows wrinkled in perplexity i nodded hes going to expose them but peter she said theyre exposed we did it that morning over by the farm there was a moments silence and then i laughed i know they are i said she stared at me wideeyed is it dangerous i was sick of evasions and there was no need for them with sheila i think its about as dangerous as it can be i said if he gets into that house among the russians and makes any effort to destroy those plates i wouldnt give twopence for his chance of coming our of it alive she had nothing to say to that i dropped my foot from the runningboard of her car and stood up its up to us now i said heavily im going after him theres just one sporting chance of catching him up before he gets there if i get away at dawn im reckoning to catch him just the other side of the italian frontier she nodded for the moment she was satisfied with that and i went on to tell her about mollie lenden all right she said at last ill go in and see her and look after her ill take her up to my room and she can lie down for a bit shell be sleeping here tonight wont she i can lend her things i expect so and then i hesitated a little youll be careful what you say though what about i eyed her steadily i havent told her that we exposed the plates ourselves it didnt seem much good telling her that and i funked it she stood there for a minute chewing the corner of her glove i dont think its any good telling her that just yet she said it wont help her much will it she glanced up at me in the dim light it was very sweet of you to think of that peter she said softly very kind and very considerate you know youre rather a dear and then she turned and went away across the yard towards my house i stood there watching her until she disappeared six presently i went into the house and up into the library there was a copy of the encylopaedia britannica there i opened it at a map of italy and stood staring vacantly at the ligurian riviera i had been along that coast as far as monte carlo from nice farther than that it was quite unknown to me in the end i had to turn to the index for information about lanaldo i found it on the map then it was one of a dozen very small towns up in the hills rather more behind ventimiglia than mentone that map was on too small a scale i had taken on the job of rearranging the library one winter so that i knew my way about there was a series of atlases there called maps of europe i dragged out one of the volumes and found quite a good map of the county behind san remo to a scale of about two miles to the inch my heart sank as i studied it lanaldo lay about six miles inland from the sea and about three from the french frontier it stood on the side of the roja valley about three hundred feet above the main road that runs up the valley from ventimiglia to the north no road was shown leading to the town itself i knew what that meant it would be one of the walled cavernous little mountain towns of that neighbourhood where every street serves as a sewer and every cellar as a stable that would not have worried me but that i knew the sort of country that those towns stood in as i stood there studying the map upon the table before me i was appalled at the mountainous nature of the country literally it was all up on end beyond the bed of the river i could see nothing to indicate flat country of any description there behind the town the hills rose up into a peak about three thousand feet high called monte verde the country was simply studded with things like that there was no possible place where one could put down an aeroplane unless it were in the bed of the river and i knew what sort of landing that would be i lingered for a little while longer over the map the scale was too small to show houses but i was able to make a pretty good guess at the probable position of the casa alba i decided that if it were a centre for soviet activities it must be near the road if then its address was lanaldo it must be on the road immediately below the town i didnt think that thered be much difficulty about finding the house if once i got out there i left the maps lying open on the table meaning to come back and consult them again later in the night in the stableyard i found kitter putting away sheilas car we should want that car before the night was out i thought kitter i said and he turned and came towards me he was a young chap and very smart on his job i dont suppose he was thirty ever had anything to do with aeroplanes he shook his head no sir i was with the tanks in the war i nodded ive got a machine out on the down this side of leventer she wants a new bit of oil pipe about a foot of seveneighth stuff or it may be inch rubber pipe can you find that for me tonight for an aeroplane sir i nodded he shook his head if he was at all startled he didnt show it young saven might have a bit at his place sir ive got nothing like that he was a sound man and i knew that hed be for me in this thing i rested one foot upon the runningboard of the talbot and stared at him reflectively this has been a damn bad days work kitter i said quietly yes sir he said i put it to him frankly then i forget exactly what i said but told him straight out that there was fishy business on hand and that it hadnt been quite an ordinary burglary and then i told him something about the breguet and i told him that i was going to fly it out to italy at dawn and i told him a little more than that that if he was to help me hed be putting himself well within the reach of the law and it might be that i shouldnt be able to get him out of the mess i told him all that and that it was up to him to make his own decision as to whether he gave me a hand with that machine or not and at the end of that he scratched his head and said i dont know where youd go to get a bit of pipe like that he said theres just a chance that we can get a bit off young saven and then he said will we be working all night sir i nodded most of it if im to get away at dawn he considered for a minute i think we ought to get young saven in on this sir he said i do straight hes only just come out of the air force can he keep his mouth shut kitter laughed hed kill his grandmother for the chance to handle an aeroplane again sir tell him this is on and hell never rest till he sees you in the air if he gets to know that the policell stop you flying if they get on to it i do think we ought to have saven sir and so we had saven and we got out sheilas car and ran down to under in it and ran saven to earth in his fathers pub kitter went in to broach the matter with him while i went on to the police station they kept me there discussing the burglary for over half an hour in the end we came to the conclusion that sanders must have disturbed the burglars before they had had time to get to work on my safe i signed a deposition that they had stolen my cashbook since sanders had admitted to seeing them with something black the inspector congratulated me that nothing more important was missing i got away from there at last and went back to the pub kitter and saven were in the little garage in the yard turning over a heap of scrap and junk in the light of a candle stud in a bottle saven turned to me as i came in the flickering candle flung great shadows around the little place as i stood in the doorway peering around among the wrecked and derelict tenpound cars that saven deals in evening saven i said kitter told you about this machine he came forward and nodded he was a little short man quite young and with a shy birdlike manner he told me as you wanted a bit of oil union for it sir this stuff the right size do you think i took the pipe he handed me i couldnt say till we try it on the job whats the machine sir thats what they use on avros and the like o that i shook my head slowly shes a breguet nineteen in the flickering darkness he stared at me in amazement the french breguet what they done the longdistance flights on i nodded thats the machine lord sir he said shes as big as a fawn i nodded ive never seen a fawn i said but this ones pretty big i had aroused his interest thoroughly how would it be if i was to come along with you and fit this bit o pipe sir he inquired ive never worked on one o them but ive got a ticket for most of our service types and i expect its about the same in the darkness i was suddenly aware that i was very tired i came lo ask if you could give a hand i said we went out of that place and got into the car saven was talking to kitter in low lones from what i heard kitter was telling him hed got to keep his mouth shut i thought as i drove that the gods had been very good in sending me a couple of firstrate mechanics at this time with their help i had just a sporting chance of getting this machine into the air without them the odds would have been so heavily against me that i do not think i should have had the courage to go through with it they were local men both of them born and bred within ten miles of the place where i was born and bred myself west sussex all of us i had known of them and they of me since we were ten years old i knew they wouldnt let me down in this affair however fishy it might seem to them and that knowledge heartened me it was very dark but a fine overcast night i remember that i turned to kitter once during the drive well take this car right up to the bam i said we shall need the lights and so we left the road not very far from the spot where i had picked up lenden on that first night of all and we went wandering over the grass upon an ancient track barely distinguishable in the darkness down the incline of the slopes it was rough going but we went slowly and so we arrived at the barn at about eight oclock in the evening of that night behind the barn the broad overhanging wings of the breguet loomed deserted in the headlights exactly as she had been when i saw her last lumme said saven she isnt half a size he turned to me as i got out of the car did you say youre going to take her up yourself sir i nodded at him in the dun white light thats the big idea he seemed about to say something bot didnt say it we swung die car round behind die barn until the lights bore on the engine cowling of the breguet and then we got to work it was a pleasure to watch saven on the job in five minutes he had stripped the cowling with our help and had got a clear idea of the run of die petrol and oil systems he had brought with him in the car a great assortment of stuff with many tools by nine oclock die job was done he had examined every oil and petrol pipe and had remade the majority of the flexible unions he had examined the water system and had run over every other component of the engine very systematically and then at the last he dropped down from the nose of the machine and stood wiping his hands upon a bit of rag well he said quietly she should run now it took us about twenty minutes to get her started she went off with a rush then and surged forward against the pigtrough that we had fitted for chocks till saven caught her on the throttle we let her run warm for a bit and then we ran her up to full power she ran up sweet and true for all her week out in the open in the end saven throttled her down and we saw him begin to clamber from the cockpit he hesitated up there for a minute and then climbed slowly to the ground shes running very sweet he said he turned to me about the petrol sir will she have enough for what you want i had been thinking about that lenden said she had fuel left for seven hours i muttered wed better make it up to ten whatll she use an hour he eyed her thoughtfully i couldnt rightly say twentyfive gallons an hour cruising perhaps maybe thirty say well want another forty to fortyfive tins of shell thatll mix up with the stuff whats in the tank if its aviation and she wont notice the difference i dont think i nodded can you get that quantity tonight he said he thought he had that much in store i clambered up into the cockpit and saven came up and sat on the cowling beside me and for a quarter of an hour he coached me in the massed controls till i knew every tap in the petrol system and every gadget on the dash by heart with its appointed function in the scheme of things essentially the flying controls were the same as when i used to fly those were straightforward and my skill was the only criterion for their proper use the engine and fuel controls had to be learned by heart and he coached me till i was wordperfect it worried me that all the labels were in french finally saven and kitter got out on to the wingtips and we set to work to taxi her up the hill there was a southwesterly wind that night i had decided with saven that we would take her up to the top of the down and then along as far as we could get her to the east that would give me about half a mile in a southeasterly direction for my takeoff before i came to the telegraph wires bordering the road id got to get her over those those wires were a worry to me the first three or four hundred yards of that run was flat from there the ground sloped gently down to the road i didnt know how much run a machine like this would want i only knew that that old be that i used to fly in the war would have got off in about half that distance if she was ever going to get off at all things might have changed a bit however since last i flew it scared me to think how long ago that was i knew what would happen if she didnt clear the wires of course she would trip up on them and go crashing down nose first into the field beyond and with all that petrol in the fuselage she was pretty certain to take fire its sometimes an encumbrance to know too much the thought of that fire didnt help me a bit we got her up on the top of the down all right and then we began to manoeuvre her into the correct position finally we settled her quite comfortably at the extreme end of the run with her tail in among the gorse bushes that formed the limit of the good ground that was the last that we could do with her for the present i stopped the engine took a last look round the cockpit and clambered down to the ground kitter and saven were talking together by the wingtip they broke off as i approached and kitter came towards me ive been talking to saven sir he said you dont want to start away before its light do you i shook my head ill get away directly we can see the road from here youll go back to the hall an get a bit of sleep now sir he eyed me anxiously reckon youll want a bit of sleep before starting sir flying all that way id come and call you when you want theres nothing more to do here bar filling her up and saven and i can do that i hesitated somebodys got to stand by the machine all the time shes out blow away now thats so said saven i tell you what ill run you back to under while mr kitter stays out here sir then i can get the petrol from my place and come back and then mr kitter can come and call you when you want i considered for a moment it will be light enough by halfpast five i said i should have to be called soon after four thats right sir said kitter and we arranged it so i knew that a little sleep might make all the difference to the upshot of this flight i was tired and sleepy as it was and i was most terribly worried about those telegraph wires i should want to be absolutely on the spot when it came to getting over those i thought curiously enough i cannot remember that i worried very much about the other end of the sight that was hopeless i suppose we left kitter with the pickets and the mallet in case the wind got up and i went back to the hall with saven in the talbot he dropped me at the entrance to the yard swung her round and went back by the way that he had come to load the little car with petrol cans i went into my house there was nobody there and the fire was nearly out on the mantelpiece the clock showed five minutes to eleven i kicked the fire together and threw on a little more coal poured myself out a whisky and soda and then i went over to the mansion everyone had gone up to bed for i had to let myself into the mansion with my key the lights were all out and in the darkness the great house was very still i went up into the library and settled down there for half an hour in the stillness of the house the small rustling of my movements startled me with their immensity i was very tired i had only indifferent material for my study there was a good map of france in the encyclopaedia britannica but to a lamentably small scale i settled down to plot my course with that and with the maps of europe which were on much too large a scale to give me much assistance i had no protractor and only a slip of paper for a scale but as i bent over the maps the old practice began to come back to me in flashes there was the mediterranean a big mark to hit and there was the straight course to it i noted the compass bearing for windage i must try to correct my course by landmarks as i went along i stayed up there for half an hour but there was very little that i could do i tore the map out of the encyclopaedia and folded it carefully and i tore out three pages from the maps of europe those three are still missing and one can see the pruned edges in the volumes i replaced that volume of the encyclopaedia but the others were irreplaceable and then having done what i could to lay my amateurish course i went back to my house in the sittingroom the fire had burnt up well and was throwing great flickering shadows upon the walls and ceiling i lit the readinglamp by the piano and busied myself for a time in minor preparations for the flight i had an old automatic pistol with a few clips of cartridges that i used to carry in the war in case of fire i got out this thing saw that the mechanism still worked freely and slipped it into my pocket then i set to looking out warm clothing by a quarter to twelve all that was done there was nothing for it now but to go to bed till kitter came to call me i stood in the middle of the room and stared around lenden would be in the train on his way south from paris by now getting on towards dijon i could picture him huddled in the corner of a french secondclass carriage nursing his newfound patriotism and the image of his wife awake and darkeyed in the night i could see him in the long pauses of the train in the stations his long hair ruffled and falling down upon his forehead rubbing the dew from the window to try and find out how fer he had gone upon his way while the train went whew and a little horn sounded from the rear i wondered if be was armed i wondered what story he was going to tell at the casa alba l moved over to the piano and sat down wondering impersonally whether i should live to see him again i sat there for a little time before the piano thinking about the work id done in sussex since the war and the small noises from the fire made me company so that i was not quite alone and then after a time i stirred a tittle on the stool and began to play i cannot remember what i played that night there was almost certainly a strong vein of chopin and i dare say i played a little grieg because i was in that mood i may have gone on playing for twenty minutes or so and then in a pause i dropped my hands sharply from the keys and swung round on my seat there was somebody coming in by my front door long before she came in sight i knew that it was sheila she came and stood in the open doorway of my room and i smiled at her from the musicstool good evening i said i hope i didnt wake you up by my playing she shook her head i wasnt asleep she said i heard you playing and so i came over she moved closer to the fire and crouched down before it she had only a coat on over her pyjamas and bedroom slippers on her bare feet she had in some queer way that i am not competent to describe the appearance of having slept in her hair and being only recently awake and because she hadnt got the proper quantity of clothes on i didnt go over to her because i was afraid of making her feel awkward and so we sat at opposite ends of the room she crouched down before the fire and i on my musicstool and for a little while we sat like that in silence and then she said peter and i went over to her by the fire and drew up a chair near her where have you been she asked ive been trying to find you all evening but nobody knew where you were she paused for a minute and then she said weve made a frightful bloomer over this thing peter i nodded it was a mistake not to tell him that id exposed those plates but it didnt seem like that at the time did it she shook her head i thought it was the best way then doing it like you did whats happened to his wife shes asleep i think i put her to bed quite early about halfpast nine shes quite happy about it now she thinks hes doing a perfectly splendid thing heroic shes most awfully proud about it all i grinned but there was very little laughter in me at that time thats what it is i said mechanically heroic she twisted round and looked up at me puzzled it seems so funny she said i didnt know that heroes were like that nobody ever does i said there was a little silence then and we sat together there before the fire in the dim light of my room i had a vague feeling that she oughtnt to be there at all at that lime of night especially in her pyjamas and that instead of sitting there with my hand upon her shoulder i ought to be packing her off back to the mansion and to bed with a few delicate wellchosen words instead i did nothing about it and we sat there till she turned to me where do you suppose he is now in the train i replied round about dijon or macon or somewhere down that line so far as i can see he must be going out by ventimiglia that means going through marseilles he gets there about nine oclock tomorrow morning as i reckon it she stared up at me pleadingly isnt there any possible way of getting at him to tell him what was that you said about going after him to catch him up wasnt it any good i didnt want much to tell her about that i had meant to slip off in the early dawn before she was about and so prevent an explanation but there was nothing for it now i think it may work all right i said and smiled down upon her anyway its worth trying she twisted round upon the floor and stared up into my face what is it you cant catch him now i hesitated for a moment and leaned forward and chucked a bit more coal on the fire theres only one way of doing it so far as i can see i said thats by air his aeroplanes still out there on the down oh she said softly do you mean youre going to fly it out there after him beneath my hand her hair was very soft like spun silk why yes i said simply thats the big idea ive been out there all evening with kitter and with saven from the red bear getting the machine ready im pushing off in her at dawn i paused according to my reckoning thatll get me out there just before noon or about noon shell go all the way without a stop that machine the real trouble will be at the other end im afraid after ive landed i havent got any papers for myself or for the machine the machine hasnt got any registration letters i havent even got a passport that means theyll jug me for a cert in italy if they can get hold of me after ive landed ive got to keep out of the way of everybody and yet get into touch with lenden before he reaches this house the casa alba thats the real difficulty she eyed me seriously its a ripping scheme peter she said if theres anyone can make it work its you its a fifty per cent chance i replied i dont put it higher than that what are you going to do when youve landed she inquired i left her for the moment got up and fetched my maps from the table and came back and sat down as i had been before she knelt up before the fire and leaned against my knee to see the maps i spread out the largescale one of that district and showed her the main features of the land you see this hill behind lanaldo i said monte verde its called here it looks to be all woody and i think these little squiggles mean its pine trees im going to put the machine down up there its about three miles from lanaldo and looks to be pretty desolate then im going to work down through the woods down here across that little col and down that sort of ravine till i get out on to the main road there it looks as if there might be pretty good cover all the way when i get to the road i shall have to wait there in a sort of ambush if he comes by ventimiglia hes got to get to the house by that road and i suppose hell be in a car i should be able to stop him there i didnt tell her the rest of the plan which was simply that i was going to wait there upon the road till five oclock if by that time i had not succeeded in intercepting him then i should have to assume that he had passed and the only thing to do would be to go up quietly through the woods and see what was going on at the white house i didnt know what that might lead to but it was with that in mind that i had resurrected my old automatic i hoped to god that the cartridges were still all right she leaned across my knee pulling the map towards her and studying it with brows wrinkled in a frown peter i dont see where youre going to land on monte verde from this map she said slowly i thought aeroplanes needed a great big open space for landing it doesnt look as if youd find anything like that there girls in these days know too much i didnt quite know what to say to that they dont need so much room as all that i said uncomfortably not the way im going to land this one she looked up very quickly at that do you mean you cant land it properly out there she asked i dont understand i smiled at her in what i hoped was a reassuring way though if anyone needed reassuring it was me theres two ways of landing an aeroplane i explained one so that you can use it again afterwards and one so that you cant the second one is quite a good way if you dont happen to want the aeroplane particularly she was about to say something but i stopped her in a place likethat i said its pretty certain that therell be clearings if theres a really flat eligible sward i shall put her down the first way because i dont like waste but if there isnt anything like that then i shall put her down on the treetops in the war i always used to look for two things when i had the wind up or engine failure a good big field or failing that a wood trees are soft you know she was staring up at me intently beneath my hand her shoulder was very still you mean youre going to crash i laughed at her thats a hard word to use i replied im going to put her down on the treetops nobody ever got hurt doing that she was still staring up into my face peter she said dont go and get hurt i shook my head all right i said and smiled a little ill be careful about that she wasnt satisfied at all but she looked down and began playing with the poker in the ashes of the hearth must it be done like that she asked isnt there any place where you could land ordinarily i shook my head you see it means being arrested if i put down on an aerodrome with that machine at one time i did think of going to london and chartering a machine from imperial airways but i havent got a passport and itd mean spending all the morning getting one no this wayll be all right a new idea struck her is this a very big machine very powerful bit of a lump i said she twisted round again to look at me peter when did you fly last are you in practice i shifted a little uneasily in my chair and because she was leaning up against my knee she noticed it one doesnt lose practice in a thing like that i lied thatll be all right dyou mean you havent flown at all since the war not very much i said i had done it by saying that she slipped round and stood erect pulling her clothes a little more closely about her i got up too and we stood looking at each other before the fire you cant do this peter she said its a most frightful risk youre taking i wont have it i smiled at her im afraid you dont come into it i said peter you simply mustnt please peter she stood there before me flushed and dishevelled and very sweet if there had been less at stake between us at that moment i would have been no gentleman and kissed her but i didnt do that and so i only stood there grinning at her and when she saw me grinning at her like that she gave up and there were tears in her eyes when she spoke again peter dear she said unsteadily you mustnt do it really its frightfully dangerous i took one of her hands in mine she has very small hands not half the size of my own i hadnever had the chance to examine one of them before but i must i said she looked at me dumbly for a moment i dont see why i stood there with her in the glow of the fire playing with her hand and wondering at the littleness of it because ive got to live with myself i said you cant shirk that and because id like to see lenden have another cut at living with his wife again thats all and we stood there silent like that for a long time in the end she looked up at me you really mean it peter im afraid so i replied i dont see that theres any other way of getting in touch with him in time if there was any other way id take it god knows i dont want to fly the ruddy thing i was still examining her fingers she had made no movement to regain her hand when must you start she asked at dawn i said kitter will be coming to call me soon after four hes getting the machine filled up with petrol now with saven she looked up at me anxiously and tried to withdraw her hand but i didnt allow that you must get to bed she said softly at once l nodded slowly i know i must i said and so must you you oughtnt to have come over really in all the years that i have known sheila she has never been quite repressible there was a glint of humour in her eyes when she looked up like a spot of sunlight in a puddle of rain i suppose not she said but then you oughtnt to be holding my hand like this in the middle of the night i slipped my arm round her and drew her a little closer to me in regard to that i said i suppose no gentleman would take advantage of you so far as to tell you that he loved you in the middle of the night and when youve only got about half the proper complement of clothes on she stood there very quietly in my arms peter she said softly are you asking me to marry you i grinned down at her lord no i said not at this time of night it wouldnt be proper ill do that one morning before breakfast m the cold light of day when i can see your freckles and you can see the cigarette stains on my fingers but for tonight i just wanted you to know that i love you before i pack you off to bed she drew a little closer to me peter dear she said ive known that for the last two years there was a hiatus then an interlude which must have lasted for ten minutes or so i sometimes think that no gentleman and certainly no lady would have enjoyed that interlude so much as we did or indeed would have permitted it to happen at all but at last its time you went to bed i said and i wrapped her cloak more closely round her and we went out of my house and across the stableyard in a still moonlit night in the hall at the foot of the great staircase she left me and i stood and watched her mounting in the dim light till she was lost in the shadows of the passage at the head i let myself out of the mansion and went back to my house across the yard and then since it was one oclock i threw off my clothes and took a couple of aspirins and went to bed and i slept at once i was roused almost immediately before i had had time to realize that i was asleep the readinglamp by my bed was switched on and i became drowsily aware that somebody was shaking me by the shoulder i rolled over and opened one eye and it was sheila its time to get up peter she said softly kitters just come with the car its four oclock it was still quite dark i stirred sat up in bed and looked at her sleepily all right i muttered and i sat there looking at her sleepily for a minute while she smiled at me i say was i dreaming or did i tell you that i loved you last night because if by any chance i didnt id like to tell you now she laughed softly you did tell me something about it peter she said but its sweet of you to say your piece all over again and she then leaned over the bed and kissed me and i put an arm round her and returned it sleepily as i have done a hundred times since then and when that was over now you shoot off i said while i get up and as she moved away i noticed for the first time that she was fully dressed in a lightblue jumper and a tweed skirt she paused in the door what dyou want for breakfast peter she inquired ive got some coffee here and toast and marmalade and theres some eggs would you like one poached i passed my hand over my forehead i dont know that i can eat anything at this time of the morning she nodded slowly ill poach a couple anyway if you cant eat them you can mess em abaht a bit but i expect you can and then she was gone and i got up i dressed as if i was a starter for a polar expedition and when i was ready i went sleepily through into the sittingroom sheila had turned my fireplace into a sort of camp kitchen and breakfast was in train kitter was crouching over the fare and helping her i crossed the room to them have you been to bed at all i asked him ive only been up half an hour and have something to eat morning kitter i said hows the machine savens been having another go at her sir he got the juice into her all right and weve been running the engine again sos shed be warm to start when you want her shes running a treat glad to hear it i remarked and sat down to breakfast it should be light enough by halfpast five i didnt eat very much sheila ate one of my eggs and she cut a couple of packs of sandwiches for me i took these in the pocket of my ulster together with a fairsized flask of brandy and then having swallowed a couple of cups of coffee i was ready we left the house at about five oclock and set off for the down that was a silent drive sheila was beside me and kitter in the dickeyseat behind i was preoccupied with the details of my course i remember that i was very much concerned whether i should be able to fix my position when i came to france on the other side of the channel the wind was from the southwest and light that would help i thought we came to the down at about a quarterpast five and left the car by the roadside it was light enough to see fifty yards or so by then as soon as i stopped the engine of the car i heard a low rumble in the distance away to the east saven was running the engine of the breguet that walk over the short grass to the machine seemed to take an infinite time it was trying that i remember that sheila and i were speaking inconsequently of little trivial things in short disjointed sentences i promised to send her a cahle as soon as i got an opportunity telling her what had happened it was in both our minds that she would know what had happened if she didnt get the cable but we didnt talk about that i hurried on to other subjects hoping that she hadnt noticed the break long afterwards she told me that she had hoped the same of me funny in a way but i didnt see it then at last we got to the machine it was very nearly light enough for the takeoff by then already i could see the line of the road half a mile away saven was up in the cockpit of the machine and the pig trough was securely wedged beneath the wheels as chocks i clambered up to the cockpit beside him out of earshot of the others on the ground he throttled the engine till she was just ticking over shes running fine sir he put his hand on the lever controlling the adjustable propeller you want to leave this just like it is i wouldnt touch it at all not if i was you ive set it right for you from the static revs i nodded and asked him one or two questions about the machine i went over the fuel system with him again to ensure that i had forgotten nothing and then youd better get along down to the road for the takeoff i said behind those telegraph wires i want somebody down there he stared at me blankly for a moment and then lord sir he said she should go up over those all right its only half a load or something o that you want to hold her down on the ground you know with the tail well up till she flies off of herself and then if you feel shes a bit close just give her a yank up and shell be all right i nodded i know thats how i used to take off my be with a full load of bombs but get along down there all the same i paused and then i said id hate to get singed he grinned reckon you wont be able to keep her on the ground but ill get along down there sir just in case shes all ready for you to take off youve got the chocks under now but kitter can take them out when youve run up i climbed down to the ground again and began putting on my helmet saven followed me to the ground spoke for a moment to kitter and set off for the road sheila turned to me wheres saven going to down to the road i said hes going to give me a signal as i go over if the engines running all right she nodded satisfied with that explanation i finished settling the goggles securely on my forehead i have never worn them either takingoff or landing and made sure that i had everything that i wanted in my pockets and then i turned to her goodbye sheila i said and stooped to kiss her she could only reach halfway round my shoulders with her arm goodbye peter she said and kissed me in return that was all we had to say that morning i straightened up and spoke to kitter ill run her up a bit i said and then when you see me wave my hand get that pig trough out of the way and stand clear look out you dont run into the prop while youre doing it he hesitated for a moment and then good luck sir he said shyly i climbed up into the cockpit again and stowed away my maps in the machine the controls fell naturally to my hand i settled myself comfortably into the seat strapped myself in and saw that everything in my pockets was accessible then i waved kitter to the tail he took sheila with him and together they lay over the tail plane in the blast from the propeller while i ran the engine up she ran up very smoothly the revs and the oil pressure were steady as a rock and the beat was true i can remember that in all sincerity i thanked god for having sent saven at that time i throttled the engine down again and waved to kitter he crept under to remove the pig trough i saw him come out with it and stand clear straight ahead of me on the far side of the road half a mile away i could see saven waiting in the field i became very cold quite suddenly i smiled down at sheila and then i settled myself again into my seat for the takeoff it was nine years and seven months since i had last flown an aeroplane seven before i begin upon the account of that flight of mine i would like to digress a little in order to explain a little more fully to what order of pilots i belong i learnt to fly in england early in if this account should be read by anyone who shared that experience with me he may skip the next few paragraphs because he will know all that i have to say upon that subject but for those who have learnt to fly since the war in the quiet schools and flying clubs and for those who have never piloted a machine themselves i would like to try and point out something of the peculiar terrors legacies of my early training which infested all the flying i have ever done i was trained in the days of ignorance that ignorance has been written about in oilier places and the only aspect of it which i propose to touch on here is the great ignorance that existed in those days on the subject of spinning we knew that a clumsily executed turn might have the effect of putting an aeroplane into a spinning nosedive a parkes dive some of us called it because lieutenant parke was one of the very few people who had come out of it alive in general a spin once started continued to the ground the machine hitting very violently and that literally was all we knew about it when i was taught to fly there was a rumour in the camp that it was possible to put an aeroplane voluntarily into a spin and get it out again somebody said that somebody had told him that he had seen somebody do it at farnborough closer to hand one of our own instructors a bachelor of science and a schoolmaster in civil life claimed that he had done it so far as i remember he had the peculiar idea that the way to get out of a spin was to force the machine into a steeper dive still as nobody had seen him do it the first time he was disbelieved whereupon he set out to show us how to do it and it is a fact that the rotation of the machine had practically stopped before he hit the ground i forget his name now that made us think that there might be something in it after all that given sufficient height it might some day be possible to recover a machine from a clumsily executed turn before it spun into the deck i would like to try and impress upon the reader the intense moral effect that this spin had upon us it was a ghoulish thing waiting to spring out upon you in an unguarded moment all kinds of legends and exaggerations cloaked its path my own instructor told me that if one got into a spin on an avro the wings fell off he of course had never dreamed of trying it another legend was that the machine frequently turned upside down in its rotation to the ground throwing the pilot out most terrifying of all was the uncertainty of the commencement of this thing we knew that it began from an imperfectly executed slow turn but just how bad the turn had to be to loose this frightful thing upon us was what none of us quite knew for most of us that made our turns a nighimare and increased our consumption of alcohol to an extraordinary extent i crashed five times during the war not counting the occasion on which i was shot down three of those were ordinary landings upon an aerodrome and came from shutting off the engine at the wrong moment i think the other two were forced landings away from the aerodrome due to engine failure those at the time i regarded as an act of god and a certain crash for any pilot good or bad i am told that things are not quite like that now they tell me that no pupil is allowed to fly solo in these days till he can loop spin and pull off a forced landing in considerably better style than the crack pilots of my day well things change but what i would wish to point out in connection with this flight that i made in the breguet is simply that i am a pilot who stopped flying in a relic of the past the takeoff went better than i had hoped i settled into my seat pulled the stick back central and opened up the throttle gradually straight beforrme half a mile away i could see the white line of the road against the greyness of the down and the line of the telegraph wires the breguet stirred and moved forward i thrust the throttle forward to the limit of its travel and sat tight we began rolling over the short turf towards the road i held the stick a little bit forward till presently the tail rose from the ground and the fuselage came level then i just sat very still not daring to try and pull her off the ground while the telegraph wires loomed closer and the wind came whistling over the windscreen and around my head she reached the end of the level ground and began to run down the incline to the road but by that time she was travelling at great speed and i could feel that she was gettinghght and then perhaps three hundred yards from the road she came off ate ground i madeno move ment of the stick but shot a glance at the airspeed indicator it read a hundred and thirty kilos she touched ground once more very lightly and then without any conscious movement on my part she was ten feet up mindful of my precautions i tried to hold her down a little the tiny movements that i dared to make were ineffectual i had her trimmed to climb and climb she would so that we were fifty feet up when we passed over the telegraph wires she went up very quickly it cannot have been more than three or four minutes before the altimeter showed a thousand metres i was well past leventer by that time and the earth was getting very faint it was still half dark and there was a sort of haze over everything but i could see a glint of open water on my left which i thought was portsmouth harbour i made up my mind to turn then and fly back over the down in order that they might see that i was all right and that sheila might be comforted about this business i had the wind up of that turn from the first but it had to be dose some time and i began to make my preparations for it i was then at about four thousand feet as a preliminary i levelled the machine out and throttled the engine a little the speed increased tremendously every wire seemed to scream at me thew indicator rose to about two hundred kilos a rapid mental calculation showed me that that was nothing like her top speed i hardened my heart and thrust the nose down till she was doing about two hundred and forty which i interpreted as a hundred and fifty miles an hour i set the tail trim for that speed and then i began my turn by pressing lightly on the rudder the machine swung slowly to the left on an even keel and the cold air came in over the side of the cockpit like a blast from a hose drenching and stifling me i shifted the stick over to give her a little bank and rode more heavily upon the rudder the nose of the machine dropped suddenly below the horizon and continued to drop i didnt know what to do then and took off all rudder in a panic the turning stopped and the air came in over the other side of the cockpit i was sideslipping violently with the nose of the machine down and the engine on i pulled her up a little and tried a bit of rudder again completing the turn in a heavy sideslip upwards and outwards i was too high up in that dim light to be able to see them on the ground but by the landmarks i passed more or less over the spot that i had taken off from and then i set off on my course i was at about twelve hundred metres at that time and the clouds were close above me i had had enough of properly banked turns and got the machine on to her course by skidding round with a very gentle application of the rudder alone that turn must have taken me five miles to do ninety degrees but i got her round without incident and settled on to my compass bearing i set to work then to adjust my controls till i was flying at two hundred kilos without either losing or gaining height by the time i had done that i was over the coast by chichester before me the sea stretched away dimly into the distance as far as i could see grey and corrugated in the morning light that crossing took an hour and for the majority of that time i was out of sight of land the clouds got lower as i approached the french coast and i had to drop off height till i was down to about two thousand feet i came in sight of land at about twenty minutes past six and crossed it five minutes later visibility was getting quite good by then i missed havre by seven or eight miles passing to the east of the town and crossing the seine estuary at the point where it became evidently a river that gave me the information that i wanted to correct my course for wind i headed a bit more to the west and went trundling out over france at about two thousand five hundred feet everything seemed to be going very well for the first time i began to feel real confidence that this venture of mine would prove successful if all went on going so well i was confident that i could get to lanaldo before lenden and i was pretty sure that i should find somewhere to put the machine down gently if the landing went off all right it seemed to me that i stood a really good chance of intercepting him before he reached the house that heartened me for the flight i passed over evreux and chartres and so to orleans which i reached at twenty minutes to eight the clouds had gone higher by this time and i was back at about jour thousand i was getting very cold and stiff after orleans i managed to get down to my flask and had a drink of brandy and water and i nibbled a sandwich in little handfuls from my pocket it may have been the distraction of eating that made me lose touch with my surroundings because after orleans i saw nothing that i recognized that didnt worry me much i had checked my course by each of those towns and i was confident by then that i was on the right road the clouds got higher and higher as i traversed france i followed them up until i was flying at about six thousand feet at about halfpast eight i came to the end of the clouds they thinned out and vanished altogether and from there onwards i was flying in bright sunshine i went up to about seven thousand feet at that and stayed there i didnt want the french to notice the machine more than was necessary i came to some hills at about a quarterpast nine and guessed rightly that i was somewhere round about the puy de dome i carried on rather to the east of them and presently i saw a great river winding parallel with my coarse far away to the east i searched my map and had very little difficulty in identifying it as the rhone i had no trouble after that at about ten oclock i ran through a great flock of small birds at about seven thousand feet i saw none of them clearly owing to our relative speed but i think they may have been swallows none of them hit the machine at a quarter to eleven i came in sight of a great sheet of inland water that stretched far away to the west and a minute or two afterwards i saw the sea beyond i went close enough to pick out marseilles in the distance and then did another of those long gentle turns with a scrap of rudder and no bank at all till i was heading about southeast i carried on like that until i came to the coast and set to flying down the french riviera i once spent a fortnight in nice and i knew the look of the great bluff that stands up above monte carlo i flew on down the coast keeping a sharp eye open for that thing and at about ten minutes past twelve i saw it that brought me to my journeys end i was very tired by then very thick in the head with the noise of the engine and painfully cramped i had a final drink from my flask and got out the largescale map of the lanaldo district in readiness to fix my position i passed mentone flying at about five thousand feet a couple of miles out to sea the hills here ran down into the sea with very little foreshore it struck me as i looked about and saw the smoke of a train that i must have passed lenden by this time in the strain of flying i had forgotten all about him but the sight of that train recalled me to the object of my journey ventimiglia was marked on my largescale map and from there i turned inland up the roja valley to lanaldo the air here was very bumpy due to the proximity of the hills and once or twice i hit a rough patch that put the fear of god into me i carried on dropping off a little height as i went and so i came to the little grey town on the hillside above the road that could only be lanaldo beside me to the east and scarcely lower than the machine was a thickly wooded hill that seemed to be the commencement of a range running away inland that could only be monte verde the air grew frightfully rough i flew straight on up the valley peering over the side of the cockpit and trying to spot a likely landingground now that i saw the wooded slopes i was not so sanguine about putting down upon the trees unhurt these pinewoods werent quite like our english trees there the woods seen from the air appear soft and downy these looked thin and spiky in many places i could see the ground between the individual trees then i saw that there was a clearing right on the top of monte verde the pine trees seemed to come to an end about five hundred feet below the summit and then there was a belt of some scrubby foliage of a different colour that i found afterwards to be stunted oaks the very summit of the hill was bare and seemed to be covered with grass the space available for landing would have been about three hundred yards square i suppose i determined to try it i was well past the hill then and a long way past lanaldo i gained a little height before attempting the turn then slewed the machine round clumsily in a wide sweep till i was facing back on my tracks the bare top of that hill was straight before me then i throttled back the engine and put the machine on a straight glide down to go and have a look at it i passed over the grass at about four hundred feet i suppose it looked pretty smooth for landing the wind was more or less from the south and the southern side of the grassy patch was bounded by a sort of scree from which the ground sloped away steeply in the direction of lanaldo i made up my mind that i should have to bring the machine in slowly over the oak trees on the northern side and try to stop her before she ran forwards over the edge that survey rather reassured me it didnt look too bad at all i put the engine on again and eased the machine round in a very long gentle turn to the north i flew some way to the north before i came round again in another of those long easy skid turns then i throttled the engine and put her on the glide down to land i raised my goggles on to my forehead and rubbed my eyes i can remember that the air felt very fresh and sweet i was gliding short i came to the oak trees perhaps a mile short of the grass and put on a little engine at about fifty feet above the tree tops i had one eye on the airspeed indicator all the time and eased her down slowly towards the final fringe of trees then i was there i shut off all power and passed over the edge of the grass at a height of about thirty feet thrusting her down to land she gained a little speed as i did that and i knew that the scree was getting very near i flattened her out a little near the ground irresolute then i thrust her down again and the wheels crunched heavily upon the grass the breguet quivered and bounced high into the air again slowly she sank until the wheels bounced on the grass again and we were barely thirty yards from the edge travelling at about seventy miles an hour with a sudden decision i did what i should have done twenty seconds before thrust forward the throttle the engine came to my rescue with a roar and we surged forwards over the edge of the scree and up into the air again the first shot had failed but i was convinced it could be done i had not flown slowly enough in the approach and i had come in too high over the oak trees as a preliminary to the next attempt i throttled the engine as i was flying north till we were crawling along in a manner which felt curiously slack on the controls with the indicator showing about a hundred and fifteen kilos i was about three hundred feet above the trees when i began my next turn to port which was to bring me southwards again for my second shot at landing i went into it at that slow flying speed and to begin with it was a slow gentle turn such as i had been doing up til then when i was halfway round i realized that unless i turned quicker than that i should miss monte verde altogether i banked a little more and trod hard upon the rudder the nose of the machine dropped suddenly very quickly i pulled the stick back to level her i do not think i touched the throttle or the rudder and then that ghoulish thing leapt out at me bred of my own ignorance that had been lurking for me ever since i learnt to fly in those old days when we knew so very little about flying the air under my port wings seemed to give way so that the machine lurched down in a heavy sideslip at the same time the nose dropped and she swung round in a fantastic turn i wrenched the stick hard back but the spin tightened she had the bit between her teeth by then we flicked round one or two turns at a wild incredible speed and i became aware that the trees were very near i thrust the stick away from me and threw up my elbow to protect my face we hit nose downwards in a little glade between the trees i can remember that i saw the port wing crumple up for i was thrown that way that was my seventh crash by all the rules of the game i ought to have been killed i have seen so many people killed that way that it seems all wrong that i should have got out of it alive but there is a special providence that guides the steps of fools and drunken men and i think it must have been under those auspices that i came out without a great amount of damage from that crash i dont know how long i was unconscious but i do not think it can have been longer than a few minutes i woke sharply in the end to the intolerable pain of my three broken fingers and the dull agony of a dislocated shoulder and a twisted elbow my left arm had caught it badly the one that i had flung up to protect my head apart from that there wasnt much the matter with me when i came to my senses the machine was standing on the crushed forepart of tike fuselage and the remains of the port wings with the tail and my seat high in the air i was lying forward with my head upon my left arm against the windscreen and held from sliding forward by the broad safety belt around my body my nose was bleeding freely it may have been that that brought me round and the blood streamed all over my mangled arm as i lay forward in the seat so that at first i thought that i was more hurt than i really was i raised my head and the slight movement made the crashed fuselage of the machine totter and sway perilously i was about fifteen feet from the ground i began to move my strained body to draw my left arm nearer to me the pain in my broken fingers made me stop that for a minute i lay there sweating a little with the pain and considering the position a goldfinch came out from somewhere beyond my range of vision hopped on to the trailing edge of the wrecked top starboard plane cocked his head at me chirruped and flew away i began again then i dont know how long it took me to get out of that seat and down on to the ground it may have been as much as half an hour i took it very slowly nursing my left side with my uninjured right hand and resting after every movement i slipped once when i was half out of my seat on to the cowling and that gave me a great jerk so that everything went black for a few minutes and i had to hang on tight but after that i got going again and in the end i found myself on the dry mast that was the ground of that wood beneath the trees i found that i had to stoop when i wanted to draw a breath then it was impossible to stand erect and breathe at the same time owing to the pain of my bruised ribs where the belt had caught me and held me in the seat at the moment of impact but that soon passed out of my mind when i sat down upon a stump and set to work to put my fingers into splints the middle one had the best part of an inch of bone sticking out through the skin i didnt quite know what to do with that but decided that it had better go back inside again if i could persuade it to do so i got up and moved round the crash stooping painfully to pick up any little splinters of wood or twigs that i thought might do for splints and then i went back to my stump and set to work to pull my two handkerchiefs into stripe by treading on them with my foot and pulling with my right hand by the mercy of god that flask of brandy was unbroken and was still half full it was empty by the time id done that bandaging i made a pretty good job of the fingers but i could de nothing at all with the shoulder it stuck out backwards into my coat in such a manner that the arm couldnt lie along my side and it hurt too vilely for me to try and shift it my scarf was a very long one and i made a sort of sling of that and had enough of it left to take a turn of it round my body to lash the whole arm securely to me with my helmet and goggles beneath the shoulder as a pad i dont know how long it took me to do all that but i can see now that it must have been a long time at last i finished and rose unsteadily to my feet the empty flask was lying by the stump on which i had been sitting but i hadnt the courage to stoop down to pick k op and so i left it there on the ground then i fell to searching in my pockets for the largescale map of the lanaldo district it was time i got about my business i had wasted time enough in sitting still and licking my wounds the map showed me that i was about four miles from lanaldo and five as the crow flies from the point on the road that i should have to reach if i wanted to intercept lenden on his way to the town i looked at my watch and then back to the map it was a quarterpast one i had none too much time if i was to get down to the road in time on the map the way looked pretty straightforward i had to find my way down the ridge on which i was then standing into the valley below a distance of perhaps three miles there was another ridge to be crossed and then i should be on the hillside above the road it should be simple then the woods ran straight down the hillside into the valley and the road from the look of the signs upon the map it seemed that they might be olives i put the map back into my pocket and started it was easy going the trees in that oak grove were thin and sparse and there was smooth walking between them i left the breguet and began to make my way along the ridge towards the open patch of grass where i and tried to land that walk was then and will remain to me a dream my bruised ribs made every motion a sharp slight twinge of pain not great in itself but very wearing in the shoulder there was a dull throbbing ache id made the fingers pretty comfortable and i didnt get much trouble with diem until i fell down i stopped near the edge of that grassy space and was very sick i felt better when that was over and went on from the edge of the scree i could see my way clearly the hill sloped sharply down from there and a little way below the pines began i paused there for a minute or two with the map and conned my path it was pretty dear which way i had to go i put the map away again and began the descent about seven miles away over the foothills i could see a wide expanse of sea gleaming very silvery and blue in the sunshine of that afternoon it was rough going down the ridge once or twice i found a goat track leading in the direction in which i wanted to go but for the most part it was a crosscountry walk the side of the hill among the pines was littered with great boulders and under foot there was a carpet of pine needles and rosemary it was intensely hot i was thickly muffled in the flying clothes that i had put on for leaving england in that march dawn and i could do little to open or remove them without unsettling my shoulder and so i went plodding on down the hill till i had gone perhaps a couple of miles and was getting down towards the bottom of the valley it was there that i put my foot upon a loose stone staggered desperately for a moment and fell down i was able to twist a little as i went down to avoid falling on the shoulder and i fell with my bandaged forearm and broken fingers beneath me that shook me properly i can remember that i began to weep with the shock of it and with the pain i lay as i had fallen for a minute shedding buckets of tears and when i managed to sit up again i found that the bandages had come off my fingers and the splints were loose and broken it took me a very long time to do them up again i dont know how long i was very tired and in a lot of pain and i had no brandy to help me through it this time i dare say it was twenty minutes before i was on my feet again and plodding on more carefully down into the valley in the bottom oi the valley i came to a spring that welled out of the hillside and ran away in a little trickle down the path someone had dammed it up to make a little pool i was getting frightened at the passing of the afternoon by that time but i stopped there for a minute and sluiced my head washing away the dried blood from my mouth and nose with my uninjured hand it was a sound thing to do in spite of the loss of time i think i went faster afterwards i put my lips down to ae water and took a long satisfying drink then i left the well and crossed the valley towards the opposite ridge i went faster although it was uphill by the map i had covered three miles out of the five and it was a quarter to three i pressed on up the hill and came presently to the top in a drip of sweat and a dull throb of pain before me lay the valley of the roja i could see the little grey town of lanaldo almost immediately below me and away at the end of the valley there was the blue gleam of the sea the pines came to an end here and were succeeded by olive trees arranged on terraces i found paths winding down here and before i had gone far i passed a sort of chalet with a litter of ragged children round the outbuildings who looked at me curiously as i passed i pressed on down the hill through the groves and presently i came to the end of the olives the terraces continued and were filled with rose bushes and carnations in neat rows all very well tended and watered from great circular cement tanks stuck about all over the slopes i had noticed these things from the air and wondered what they were i struck a paved mulepath then that led straight down the hill to the road and pressed on down it now and again i passed a peasant trudging up occasionally they spoke to me but mostly they let me by without a word and stood in the path when i had gone staring after me and so at about halfpast three i came down on to the road that road ran in thick white dust along the very bottom of the valley winding along beside the dry bed of the river only a trickle of water ran over the round white stones that made the watercourse it was a river that only ran full once a year i was terribly thirsty about a quarter of a mile down the valley a bend of the stream approached the edge of the road i went on till i reached that place stepped aside from the road and lay down and lapped the water like a dog i was fresher after that the place that i had reached was quite a good one for my purpose i could see the road for the best part of a mile down the valley olives lined the hill that ran down to the roadside i crossed into the shade of these and sat down near a great bush of mimosa in flower to wait there wasnt much traffic on that road the first thing to come was a onehorse diligence from ventimiglia a little covered thing like a pillbox on wheels and full of women a farmcart drawn by a dejectedlooking horse yoked with a donkey followed that and flowed on slowly past me several peasants came by on foot and a couple of priests in their black flowing soutanes and once there was a cart full of barrels driven by a very bleary merry gentleman who spoke to me and i think offered me a lift these and a few more all passed at long intervals throughout that afternoon i sat there straining my eyes down the road that white dusty road that ran down the flat valley with the whitestoned river beside it till a spur of the hill hid both from my sight i sat there from halfpast three till halfpast five shifting uneasily from time to time to find a less uncomfortable position for my arm and shoulder and shuffling the white dust up into little heaps between my shoes i sat there till the sun began to throw long shadows of the hills across the white stones of the river till the bright sunlight turned to the softest gold and the little white clouds above the hills to crimson i sat there dumbly straining my eyes down the road while the light lasted i sat there till i knew that i had failed it was about six oclock when i gave up i knew by then that lenden must have passed before i reached the road that i had missed him i discovered afterwards that i must have missed him by about half an hour he reached ventimiglia at halfpast two and drove straight out to lanaldo if i had managed to land that breguet properly i should have had ample time to get down to the road in time to intercept his car theres no good crying over that i did the best i could and that must suffice it was nearly dark in the valley i got up from my seat stiff and cold i was in a strange country without a passport and rather hurt i didnt know two words of the language and my french is that ef the schoolroom variety i had been in no great pain during the long rest but when i got to my feet in the twilight and moved forward in the thick dust by the roadside a wave of pain and sickness came over me quite suddenly and i sat down again in a hurry i had to make a pian of what i was going to do next and from my experience of the moment before it seemed to me that i could do that more easily sitting down than standing up i knew that by that time lenden must be in the casa alba and the casa alba must be dose at hand say within two miles my original plan if i missed him on the road had been to find the house and trust to luck and my own strength and resource to get me into touch with lenden among the communists i had only to get two words with him and i should have done my bit luck i might still have and i should need it but i had neither strength left nor resource i was getting very tired by that time the throbbing in my shoulder and the aching pain of my clothes pressing upon it were drowning all my power of action i could carry on no longer by myself i sat there by the roadside for a long time as the darkness fell and in the end i got the rudiments of a plan thought out i must have help in this affair that was the first conclusion that i came to that i must get allies i was up against a bolshevist organization the most obvious people in italy to set against the bolsheviks were the fascisti if i could get the local fascisti to believe my story if i could convince them that they had the chief agitators of their country right under their noses then it might be possible to get them to raid the house such a raid would give lenden a good sporting chance in the confusion he might be able to escape or get himself arrested with the plates it would create a disturbance perhaps a panic in a panic a resolute man with his wits about him can do pretty weh what he likes was lenden a resolute man in any case it seemed to me that to try and create such a diversion was the best thing i could do lanaldo must bethe starting point it was the nearest town and from what i had seen of it it was a fairsized place there was a road leading up to it not shown on the map that branched from the main road in the valley and wound in hairpin bends up the hillside among the olives till it came to an end on an open terrace before the walls of the town inside the walls the streets were not more than six feet wide mere passages for men and donkeys and cavernously spanned with earthquake arches between the house fronts that was lanaldo as i saw it later a rabbit warren of a place where every house was more or less in communication with its neighbour with the stables on the ground floor the high vaulted livingrooms above and the kitchens in little attics opening on to the flat roofs at that time i knew nothing of it but that it looked to be a moderatesized town with the buildings crushed together within walls a solid block of masonry rising above the grey shimmer of the olives there were other towns dotted about the hillsides that i had seen in my descent from monte verde but none so large as lanaldo and none that was approached by a bonahde road that seemed to mark it out from the rest as an important place i came to the conclusion that i should find all the material there for the diversion that i wanted to create if i could find a means to set things moving i sat there for a minute or two longer piecing together phrases in nay schoolboy french that i hoped would serve me in the town in the end i got slowly te my feet again and stood there for a minute trying my balance after the long rest and shifting the sling and the pad under my shoulder then when the first nausea was over and the world had stopped revolving round me i moved off up the road towards lanaldo i had to go about three miles i suppose for the road that led away up the hill wound interminably in its rise of a few hundred feet i didnt have much in the way of sharp pain on that journey but i was growing infinitely tired i went plodding up that hill mechanically i didnt count the hairpin bends on the road but from my impression of that night i should say that there were about fortyseven of them between the main road and lanaldo it was halfpast seven when i arrived on the terrace before the town there were people moving about there strolling up and down and taking the air for it was a wonderful moonlit night they stared at me curiously but i went on and up into the town through an masonry gateway approached by a sort of cobbled ramp inside the walls the place was cavernous and badly lit i went on towards the heart of the town through an acrid vegetable smell that street was about six feet wide i had to stop once and shrink into a doorway while a string of donkeys felt their way carefully past me over the slippery cobbles their backs piled high with bundles of wood fuel and once a peal of music from some mechanical instrument streamed out from a brilliantly lit room above my head and i heard a burst of laughter and paused for a minute wondering that alley led me straight into the central square of the town an irregular open space between the tall flatfronted houses and paved with stone blocks one side of this square was occupied by a great church painted pink and yellow very bright another side gave on to a sort of bowling alley there were many people there and a dear view of the hills in the moonlight above the roofs of the houses the third side had little shops all along it and one large one with the branch of a tree hanging over the door and the legend ristorante delle monte painted with many flourishes across the front the fourth side of the square was occupied by a great barrack of a house in a severe style the groundfloor windows heavily barred in one of these windows there was a light in the light of the solitary streetlamp that stood in the middle of the square i saw a great shield above the door of that house with the royal arms of italy emblazoned on it i crossed the square and went into that house beneath the shield on my left was the room that had the light in it i felt for the handle of the door opened it and went in there was a man in there a seedylooking sort of clerk sitting at a very dirty table and working among a litter of buff forms the room was thick with the smoke of his cigarettes he looked up as i went in and said something sharply that i didnt understand there was a second chair by the wall i crossed the room to it moving a little heavily dragged it forward lo the table opposite him and sat down with a sigh that annoyed him very much he got up leaned across the table and began shooting off italian at me nineteen to the dozen i raised my head and smiled at him dyou speak english i inquired evidently he didnt parlez francis he checked his flow of oratory at that and took thought and then he began to speak in a language that i recognized as french though not the sort of french i was taught at school i had reckoned that it was pretty safe to assume that all these people could speak french the border must be within a couple of miles of that town i shook my head pas comprends i said attendez un moment he stopped talking and stood there watching me curiously as i searched laboriously for my notecase with my one sound hand i had had the forethought to bring plenty of money i extracted a pound note and tossed it across the table to him зa vaut cent francs franзais i said cest pour vous his eyes became as round as pennies i had at last succeeded in establishing a means of communication with the people of the country he began to speak again but i stopped him maintenant i said attention he sank down into his chair again and sat there fingering the note his eyes fixed on me very carefully i laid my left arm on the table in front of me and took the sling off it shifting my body to get it into a comfortable position as i did that i took the helmet and goggles from under my arm and tossed them across the table to him they would help my explanation suit aviateur anglais i said heavily tombй sur la montagne et un peu blessй comprenez he did and rose quickly to his feet making a little clucking noise of sympathy i scowled across the table at him assiezvous monsieur un moment i said and he sat down again i raised my heavy head and stared at him leaning forward so far as the strained position of my body would allow je dйsire rencontrer dйsire voir ici le capitaine des fascisti de lanaldo comprenez i couldnt make out if he did or not vous mapportez le capitaine des fascisti jai des nouvelles les plus importants des communistes dans ce paysci comprenez communistes he began to talk again and to my intense relief i heard among his blather of words the essential features of the information that i was trying to get through cest bien i said wearily moi je reste ici pendant que vous mapportez le capitaine des fascisti et quelquun qui parle anglais toute suite monsieur sil vous plвit get argentlа cest pour vous he got up from his seat went and opened the window and called to a small boy outside in the square i stopped him for a moment et un peu de cognac monsieur i said eight there was hiatus then i sat at the table drowsily examining my injuries the derk having seen the boy away on his errand came back and began rolling cigarettes he offered me one but i didnt like the look of them and refused i spoke to him again about the cognac and he said something that sounded like subito and did nothing about it in about ten minutes time we began to have visitors one or two men came into the room together and among them a short fat little man with curly black hair i liked the look of that one from the first he was a man of about fifty and i discovered later that he answered to the name of luigi ribotto he spoke for a little to the derk and then they turned to me he addressed me a little hesitantly but in quite good english good evening saire he said i am ver sorry to see that you have hurt yourself he told me that he had had a little place of iris own at one time in greek street soho where he had served a oneandsixpenny dinner of four courses in the happy days before the war i told him that i remembered the place and had often dined there and that might possibly have been true because i often used to dine in soho before the war he nearly fell on my neck when he heard that i quite thought that he was going to kiss me but it didnt come to that thank god and i spoke about the cognac and he sent the small boy flying to his ristorante delle monte across the square his big idea then was to send for a doctor at once but i managed to put him off that with the shoulder in the state it was i was afraid of what a doctor might do to me i had work to do and so long as i remained sitting in the position at that table i was pretty comfortable plenty of time for the doctor later and i began to talk to ribotto about the fascisti he said that the man i wanted to see was il capitano fazzini and he packed off another boy io look for him the brandy came then and with it a plate of biscuits i had eaten practically nothing since the early morning i and ate a couple of biscuits from a sense of duty i did better by the brandy though there was a stir by the door at last and a man came in ribotto beamed at me this will be the captain fazzini he said and shot off a string of italian at the newcomer i sat and studied the chap in the yellow lamplight while ribotto was speaking and liked the look of him he was a man of about my own age very tall and straight and with a tanned unshaven face he had a very high forehead and in some peculiar way he had the look of a leader about him in spite of his threedays beard he was wearing rather a dirty civilian coat over a black shirt his breeches and gaiters were covered with white stains and dust and his hands were rough and tanned i discovered later that his father was mayor of the place and that he himself was manager of a vermouth distillery somewhere down the river the clerk broke in upon their conversation and i thought i heard the word communist then the three of them turned and stared at me you have ah something that you want tell him asked ribotto he thought for a minute and corrected himself that you want telling him i raised my head this is a confidential matter i said ribotto translated and fazzini said something to me in italian all of us said ribotto in this room we are fascist all the town is fascist that is in your country volunteers he considered for a minute the party not socialist you can understand me what i say i nodded slowly i understand i replied youd better sit down my story will take a little time to tell i told them a much shortened version of what had happened i made lenden out to be a flying officer who was responsible for certain confidential photographs which had been stolen from his office it sounded a thin tale to me as i was telling it but it went down all right i told them how he had come out after them i dwelt for some time on the danger that he must be in and urged the necessity of an immediate raid upon the casa alba i pressed these points for all i was worth the impression that i made was very puzzling to me they were quite prepared to believe all i said for one thing they had seen the breguet flying over and had marked it as it disappeared behind monte verde they were genuinely shocked and horrified at the presence of communists in their district being all good fascists they were willing to believe that the casa alba was full of russians and they seemed to think that it might not be a bad thing to have an unofficial pogrom there yet they were very difficult to move i could make nothing of their attitude they drew a little way apart when they had heard all i had to say and began talking in low tones among themselves i remained sitting at the table with my arm stretched painfully upon it puzzled and anxious once i got impatient theres no time to be lost i said its urgent for all you know they may be getting across the border while youre talking whats the trouble ribotto raised his hand presently he said we believe what you have said to us yes but this is a difficult decision that you do not know about presently and they went on talking in the corner they talked interminably it was dear that they were uneasy about something but i couldnt make out what it was that was worrying them there was some factor in the situation that i didnt appreciate something that made them most unwilling to take any action it was maddening nine oclock struck on the bells of the campanile and then the quarter now and again they turned to me and asked me something that i couldnt answer did i know the name of the chief russian in the casa alba how long had this been going on for what was their object in coming to lanaldo i could give no satisfactory answer to any of these questions and at last their low whispering began to peter out i dont think they had come to any decision i think if that had been the whole story of that night i should have failed to stir them i had no strength left with which to combat what i took to be their indifference what i now know to have been their business interests but at that point a man came to the barred open window that faced into the square and peered into the room and said something in italian i caught the word inglesi all three of them crossed to the window with a glance at me they interrogated the fellow for a minute and then ribotto turned to me your friends they have come to find you he said you have expected them yes i raised my head heavily and stared at him ive got no friends here i said theres nobody in this part of the world that knows me whos asking for me he smiled broadly and shrugged his shoulders i do not know they have said they are friends to you he remarked it is by your name they have asked where you are they have arrive on the terrace a man and a young lady both the two of them english people with a motor car the man at the window said something yes said ribotto again to me from nice they are come fazzini said something to the man who moved away across the square into the darkness in a few minutes they will be come here said ribotto he has sent to bring them we will then see them whether they are truly friends to you but i had little doubt about it from the first i couldnt place the man at all unless it were some englishman that she had picked up on the way i tried to reckon up how sheila could have got out in the time short of flying out as i had done i didnt see that it was possible i first saw them through the window when they were halfway across the square i knew nothing of the map who walked beside her he was obviously english a broadshouldered stocky sort of chap with a very hard tanned face he was dressed in a golf jacket with light fawn breeches and gaiters at home if i had met him m the village i would have set him down as a horse dealer or a vet from leventer but i couldnt place what he was doing here i heard them at the door and turned painfully to face their entrance evening sheila i said youve been pretty quick it was about sixteen hours since i had kissed her on the down she came quickly to my table she was wearing her leather motor coat a blue one with a furry collar that brushed my face as she stooped to kiss me on the forehead i could not move to meet her peter dear she said youre hurt they told us outside the man that she had brought with her was already talking rapidly to fazzini in italian that had a very english ring to it helped out with frequent gesture and a word or two of french he was speaking to them most energetically and with more confidence than accuracy but it did the trick they understood what he was saying all right whos that i asked she bent towards me and spoke quietly in order that we shouldnt interrupt their business his names captain stenning she said directly you left this morning kitter and i drove up to london ive got a passport you see so i didnt have to wait for that i simply couldnt just sit there in under and wait till i heard from you peter i smiled at her you mean you flew out mm i went to imperial airways and they got me a special machine from the rawdon company and we left croydon at about ten oclock captain stenning was the pilot they sent with it we had to stop at paris for petrol and directly that was done we went on again but we could only fly as far as nice i had a little talk with him at le bourget when he wasnt cursing the french mechanics and i asked him if he knew lenden and he knows him quite well and then at nice i told him all about it and he offered to come on with me and see it through if id let him i was all alone and i thought itd be a good thing and so we left the aeroplane with the people there and came on by car she glanced across at him he was still talking nineteen to the dozen to fazzini but there was a humorous set to his hard face and ribotto was laughing quietly hes frightfully rough she said and smiled he was swearing most dreadfully all the time we were at le bourget but we got through the customs and the machine filled up and all in twenty minutes from the time we landed till we were in the air again and in all that hurry he got me a cup of tea and a lunch basket it was just the same at nice hes a lovery man when youre in a hurry she bent over me whats the damage peter she inquired this arm looks all funny i pressed her gently back youre requested not to handle this exhibit i replied that shoulders where it hadnt ought to be and ive bust some fingers bad for the piano im afraid she slipped off the table peter she said im going to get youa doctor i stopped her no youre not i said weve got to get this thing straightened out before anyone starts mucking me about i raised my head captain stenning he broke off his conversation and swung round on me glad to see you i said can you make out whats the matter with these blokes ive been trying all im fat to get them to go and have a look at the casa alba they agree it ought to be done but i cant shift them he laughed sharply thats just what im coming to its the smuggling i think he said curtly all the frontier towns live on it these days he turned again to fazzini and began rallying him in italian with a torrent of words and gestures the italian replied with a smile already these two were good friends and presently they came to some agreement fazzini and one of the others left the room together and the man called stenning came lounging over to my table and sat down on it casually swinging one leg well fats is all right now he said casually hes going to raid the house for us he stared down at me and at my arm extended on the table you look as if youre suffering from impact miss darle here tells me that you came out on one of the breguet nineteens you want to be careful with that chassis dyou tip her up on the ground i laughed ruefully no i saidi spun into the deck he stared at me from what height about three hundred feet christ he said succinctly might have bust your ruddy neck cartassing about like that he was staring at the hump of my coat dyou mean to tell me thats your shoulder sticking up like that i expect so i replied he swung his leg off the table wed better put that back for a start he said cant leave the ruddy thing like that all night i didnt move well get along a doctor in a minute or two i said whats happening about this raid he shrugged his shoulders and got back on to the table as you like none of the dago doctors ive had anything to do with could bring a kitten into the world without an accident but have it your own way i hadnt thought of that firstclass medical attention in lanaldo was a good bit to hope for sheila moved forward i think and hope that stenning had forgotten that she was there while he was talking tomecan youput it backshe asked he shrugged his shoulders again i cant say till ive had a look it may be too much swelled up probably is after this time ill soon tell you whether i can or not and if i cant im damned if id let any doctor here muck about with it better leave it like it is till you can get it seen to properly there was a pause he had said all that he was going to upon that subject and it sounded good sense to me ever done it before i asked he blew a long cloud of smoke lord yes shoulder twice no three times i play rugger for the quins but lacrosse is the game for that i glanced at sheila and saw her nod to me ever so slightly youd better have a cut at it i said but lets get this other thing squared up first whats happening wheres fazzini gone off to stenning lit a fresh cigarette from the butt of the old one and offered the case to me i refused fats is all right he said hes a twofisted heman i know said sheila dryly i heard you tell him so in italian hes gone to telephone hasnt he stenning spat a shred of tobacco from his lip hes not allowed to go messing about like that on his own he said hes gone to telephone to his boss in san remo this is an international affair but youll find hes a stout lad that hes all for it now what was the trouble before you came i asked you said something about smuggling stenning laughed shortly this town lives on running things across the border he said its the local industry take that away from them and you put the whole ruddy place on the dole well this casa alba of yours is a sort of agency for them from what i could make out fixes the freights and all that theyve got everyone in the district squared to shut their mouths and paying damn good money i tell you these lads dont like the idea of raiding that house one little bit i could see it clearly now lenden told me that they ran the smuggling as a blind i muttered of course thats right said stenning and a damn good blind too its kept everyone here as quiet as a mouse about what goes on in that house for god knows how many years not that they didnt smell a rat now and again old fats there it wasnt any hews to him that they were russians but they could shut their eyes to it and now youve come along and put them in the cart properly over it i thought about it for a minute whats made them change their minds why dont they just shove us all down the sink and forget about us he flicked the ash from his cigarette because theyre dagoes he said sharply north italians and a ruddy good crowd with a sense of responsibility and a sense of humour i tell you if wed been five miles the other side of the border in a french village and told them to go and raid a place like that we would have been down the sink and no mistake but this lot you can jolly them along and make them see the joke of it he eyed me seriously for a minute youd better get up on your hind legs and say the kind word to fats when he comes back he said ive said it already but itd look well coming from you theyre going to halve the income of the town by this raid pretty well and all old fats said about it was he shot off a phrase of italian thought for a minute and translated that its a bloody shame but it cant be helped he thought for a minute give me the dagoes he said quietly these north italians anyway he chucked the stump of his cigarette out of the window and turned to me lets have a look at that shoulder of yours while were waiting he said fats may be some time i dont know where that man picked up his medical skill he was the son of a most tragic marriage between a naval officer and a chorus girl i believe later in the evening he told me something of his life he had been a chauffeur before the war the beginning of the war found him building cyclecars the stenningreilly car in a leanto shed at islington he enlisted and in he was commissioned into the rfc i might have met him because when we came to compare notes i found that his squadron was only twenty miles down the line from my own bat i cant say that i remember him there were so many of that type he had been a civil pilot since the war and knew lenden well he took off his coat before starting on me i remember noticing the frothblower cufflinks that he was wearing and then he set my shoulder like a professional the worst part of it was getting the clothes off because we didnt want to cut them more than necessary he had a very sure and gentle touch that chap i think that may have been the effect of his manual profession i only know that the worst of my twinges came from sheila when she was assisting him i know thats a rotten thing to say but it is true he had the surest hands of anyone ive ever met we got the shoulder opened up at last and he made a very careful examination prodding the swellings with those sure fingers in the end he stood up ruddy good job youve kept it still he muttered thatll go back all right he spoke for several minutes to the clerk and to ribotto in mixed italian and english he wanted the chemist and not the doctor but hed forgotten the word for chemist and ribotto had forgotten what chemist meant that got cleared up at last and the derk was dispatched across the square with a message then he set to work to put my shoulder back the first shot failed and i was very nearly sick on the table the second time it went all right by the time i had stopped seeing whorls and spots the shoulder was back in place all right and i could move it a very little after that we started on the fingers stenning wasnt satisfied with the splints that the chemist brought with his bandages by a torrent of italian and pantomime he got what he wanted in an incredibly short time a pair of tinsmiths shears and a biscuit tin out of that he set to work to fashion three little troughs of tin for each finger to lie in on a bed of cottonwool after that exhibition i was content to let him set them for me and they stayed like that until i reached london fazzini came back as we were finishing those and began talking to stenning in italian they spoke together for a few minutes and then stenning turned to me he says his boss is coming over from san remo for this show he said they reckon to start at about five oclock in the morning and get to the place at dawn i moved uneasily at the table i dont see that why cant they start before stenning turned to fazzini with the question the italian hesitated lowered his voice and the talk became confidential finally stenning burst out laughing and clapped the italian on the shoulder the other smiled his slow shy smile stenning turned to me this is what it is he said the fellow whos coming from san remo fazzinis boss he isnt in on this smuggling i reckon hes outside the radius of the people they bribe he never touches a bean of what these lads get and he doesnt know about it old fats here has a party out on the border tonight and theyll be making for the casa with their stuff he wants to give them time to get clear away before the fieldmarshal arrives from san remo thats why hes fixed his raid for five oclock it was then about eleven i suppose its all right i said what if they start skipping in the meantime stenning nodded i thought of that and so did fats hes put a guard on the road to ventimiglia and hell hold up any car from the casa i dont see how lenden can get away from there except by road and thats the only road he paused i think its all right he said and i agreed we got most of my clothes on to me again and lashed the arm up stiffly with a sling then we all went across the square in the bright moonlight to the ristorante delle monte and had a meal with ribotto i managed to eat a little and to drink quite a lot so that by the time that meal was over it was midnight and i was more or less myself again that was the brandy of course i had a bad time of it when that wore off but for the next twelve hours i was very little troubled by my injuries there was no talk of going to bed we made sheila comfortable before the stove in an english wicker chair and covered her over with a rug i think she slept a good deal stenning and i sat upon rather a hard sofa before the stove smoking and drinking and talking together drowsily it was then that he told me something of the experiences of his varied life nothing that he told me lessened the respect that i had formed for him from the account of his months imprisonment for being drunk in charge to the almost incredible story which culminated in his marriage ribotto was up and about at three in the morning and we had a sort of breakfast he went out into the back premises and fried up a dish of veal and sausages helping it out with spaghetti i roused sheila and when we had had a little walk around the square to get an appetite we settled down to it that meal was never finished there was a commotion in the square and fazzini appeared in the doorway he spoke rapidly to stenning for a minute or two and disappeared stenning turned to me the road patrol have stopped a car he said from the casa alba there was an englishman in it with the chauffeur theyve got him in the town hall over there i had no doubt who it must be it seemed that a great weight had been lifted from my mind that our anxiety was over whether lenden had the plates with him or not was a matter of no consequence to us now the important thing was that he was safe i wondered how he would take the news that i had already exposed the plates i was a bit nervous about telling him that i remember whats the matter asked sheila who is it i got up from the table nursing my arm maurice lenden i said theyve got him in the town hall over there oh she said stenning grinned slowly seems to me wed better see if we cant call off that raid he remarked it seems a pity to spoil their business doesnt it well said i lets get across the way and have a look at the duke and we tumbled out of that ristorante and crossed the square to the town hall again there was a lighj in the same little room and we went crowding in at the doorway stenning first there were many the room now mostly in black shirts and the prisoner there was a little pause in the talk as we entered and stood motionless in the doorway it was as if all movements were suspended by our disappointment damned if i know what weve got here said stenning a little heavily i thought it might be maurice myself he moved forward and we followed him into the room i know who this is i said hes got relations in my part of the world hes a trades union official from the middle of the crowd of blackshirted italians the little man peered forward at the sound of my voice its not mr moran from the hall i sat down on the edge of the table and they cleared away so that i was facing him thats right i said hows the russian trip going nitter he glowered at me and was silent in the background stenning was translating to fazzini in a low tone well i said evenly lets try again where have you come from now ye know the answer to that he said sullenly from the big house up the valley and may i ask what you were doing there silence is that on the way to russia silence again well i said quietly suppose we have another shot was it you that murdered sanders my butler at the hall that shook him i saw his lip quiver and he went very white but he pulled himself together i know he muttered half to himself i think it had to come ye dont say he died mr moran was it you he faced me steadfastly ahll come back with you to england and stand trial for that mr moran i was there but it wasnt me that fired and if ahd known that manek had a pistol ahd not have gone with him i made a mental note of the name youll certainly stand trial for that i said grimly now tell me about this house up the valley why did you go there and where are you going to now the tubby little man stared me down whats that to you quite a lot i said and youre going to tell us about that house pretty damn quick i must say i had something of a respect for the little man tind out for yourself he said coolly i dont see why i should tell you anything stenning shoved his way forward he had picked up a drovers whip that was lying on a dusty shelf in the corner by christ ill tell you why he cried because unless you tell us everything you know about that place im going to run you out into the square and whip you till your guts fall out i am half inclined to think that he would have done it the little man looked up into his face and laughed is that the best reason yeve got no said sheila unexpectedly the italians made way for her and she came forward to the little man we want to find out where maurice lenden is mr nitter thats all we want really is he in the house he stared at her hell be the other englishman the one what they dont trust tall chap with dark hair sheila nodded the little man considered for a minute ahll tell ye about him he said at last yell do well to get him out of that if hes a friend of yours he turned to sheila with a smile if yed be so good as to call off your friend with the dog whip he told us that he had travelled out via paris with manek reaching ventimiglia at about seven oclock manek he said had the plates with him they had taken a car at the station and driven straight out to the casa alba they cannot have missed me on the road by longer than half an hour they reached the casa in time for dinner he refused to tell us any names or to give any descriptions but he said that there were seven people there besides himself and manek and among them he saw lenden he didnt have a chance to speak to him he said that feeling that lenden was on trial in some way or suspicion they never left him alone for a moment there was always someone at his elbow so far as he knew at this time manek was still in possession of the plates after the meal lenden was taken away by two of the others jews they looked he was sorry not to have had a chance to speak to him because he knew that lenden was a countryman and he had heard that he had done good work for the soviet in england he thought they would have had a lot in common and might have had a pleasant chat after dinner he was taken into another room given a passport and one or two other identity papers for his journey into russia at about halfpast nine they ushered him politely to his bedroom he said he wasnt very sleepy and so he sat in his bedroom and tried to read some seditious literature printed in french that he found there but he wasnt much good at french and didnt get very far with it at last for very boredom he fell asleep he was roused by manek at about two in the morning who told him to get his things on and come downstairs they were abandoning ship in the rooms below news had reached them lord knows how that the house was to be raided at dawn and they were packing up there were more people about than he had seen before country people he said they looked like and that wat very puzzling to him he knew nothing of the smuggling side of it i think manek told him the position gave hin his final instructions for the next stage of his journey into russia and told him that a car was ready to take him to san remo where he would be met he spoke to lenden before he went lenden was standing in the hall unmoved among the flurry watching the work of departure nitter had gone up to him to greet him and to say goodbye he was sorry that they hadnt had the chance of a talk you going into russia lenden had inquired nitter had replied that it would be a great experience one which he had looked forward to for many years lenden had smiled at him queerly you want to live there some time like i did he said jolly country when you get to know it really well you may like it that was was all but something in the way he spoke upset nitter rather and made him a little uneasy he wasnt quite sure that lenden meant what he said then the car was ready for him and he had driven off straight into the arms of fazzinis patrol three miles down the road who had turned the car round and brought him back up to lanaldo that was all he had to tell us and i think it was true gosh said stenning the sooner we get after them better he swung round upon fazzini but the italian needed no gingering already he was barking out little short sentences that were orders and men were slipping out of room to his obedience his fieldmarshal might follow in our tracks when he arrived so far as fazzini was concerned that house was going to be raided within hour his force of fascisti paraded in the square it took some time to get them out to parade in spite of all his efforts they must all have been in bed but i liked the look of them when they came they were a fine straight body of young men dressed in fieldgreen breeches and black shirts and each armed with a sort of truncheon there were about thirty of them with three officers the officers seemed to be distinguished mainly by the addition of an automatic pistol in a holster at the belt the place was about three kilometres distant from the town fazzini gave us the first couple of men to turn up on parade as guides explaining that he intended to double the main body most of the way to the house as soon as he got them out on to parade stenning sheila and i set off with our guides at a walking pace we had arranged with fazzini that we would halt and wait for the main body a few hundred yards short of the house i wasnt up to doubling that night it was a warm starry night and getting on towards dawn our way led out through the cavernous passages of that town and down the hillside by a paved mule track through the olives we went almost entirely in silence god only knows what each of us was thinking stenning had no particular object except a vague friendship for lenden and a great feeling that he must see the end of this show sheila i think had very little concern but for me i only knew that she kept very close to me all the way and whenever there was a bit of scrambling to be done she was there to help me i had been a bachelor for so many years that i didnt quite know what to do about that and for the most part i did my scrambling unaided and for myself if i was thinking of anything at all i was thinking of mollie lenden in that shop at winchester and how i should face her if this thing went wrong halfway to the casa there was a clatter of feet on the mule track behind us we drew in to the side and fazzinis platoon came swinging down the path past us at the double fazzim at the head he dropped out as he passed and had a word or two with us some of the smugglers for whose return he had put off the time of the raid had come into the town before he left they had told him that everybody was leaving the casa alba one party of russians had already started across the frontier by the hill paths guided by a couple of men from the town he swung off down the road after his vanishing platoon and we followed at the best speed we could we came out at last on the main road running up the valley and followed it in the thick dust for half a mile or so to the north then as we came round the spur of a little hill one of the guides said something to us and pointed the house was a few hundred yards away standing a little above the road on the slope of a hill in that dim light it seemed to be a long low white plastered place with a long piazza before the doors and windows of the front the rooms were uncurtained and brilliantly lit up great shafts of light running out into the gardens between the stone pillars of the piazza we pressed on already there must have been a little light in the sky i think for i can remember that that house was standing in a most beautiful garden a garden full of yellow mimosa and paved walks and a little stream that ran through it in cascades down the hill i wondered who the woman was who had cared for it we passed a couple of fascist sentries at the gate and pressed on to the door it stood open for our approach showing a very wide empty hall paved with great square slabs of red and white marble like a chessboard roughly smoothed and unpolished there was nobody to be seen one or two papers rustled across the marble floor as we went in nine on the right of the hall as we went in there was a door leading into a diningroom i paused on the threshold and looked in the lights were all on flooding the room with light but the room was deserted there was an unfinished meal on the table and places for about ten people in great disorder we went on down the hall from a side passage we heard the sound of voices and we pressed on till we came to a room that was full of a light blue smoke and an acrid smell fazzini was there with a couple of his officers and a few men they seemed to be holding a court over a whitefaced contemptuous stranger held in the grasp of a couple of fascists one of them was going through his pockets stenning barked a question or two at fazzini got a few short replies and turned to me this is the last of them he said the only one they found in the house burning things and i saw that the ornate square stove that stood out in the middle of the room was full of charred paper there was a great safe by the door open and empty but for one or two ledgers and a little stack of printed matter i moistened my lips ask him whats happened to lenden stenning spoke rapidly to fazzini the italian answered him at some length then stenning spoke to the prisoner the man smiled and said nothing for a minute stenning and the italian stood there motionless staring threateningly at the prisoner the deadlock was evident then fazzini said something apparently in explanation by god said stenning harshly then well ruddy well make him talk he spoke rapidly with fazzini for a minute the italian smiled and shrugged his shoulders i dont think physical violence to a prisoner was much in his line though he was willing to give us all the assistance that he could stenning stepped forward threateningly and spoke to the prisoner again i heard the words il capitano lenden linglese followed by a few more words he paused for a moment and repeated the question very slowly and distinctly the man gave a little contemptuous laugh and stennings fist crashed straight into his face with the whole weight of his body behind it the prisoner was thrown backwards with his guards against the wall coughing and streaming blood i have never seen a more brutal blow struck fazzini stirred uneasily and said something in italian stenning turned to reply and if ever i saw the devil in a mans eyes it was then he said something harshly to fazzini who seemed to acquiesce and then he swung round on sheila and myself youd better get out of the room if you dont like it be snarled we cant stay here all the bloody night i want to know whats become of maurice and this fancy mans going to tell me in a minute he turned to me and jerked his head to the door get the girl out of the room he swung back to where the prisoner was still spitting by the wall i turned to sheila come on dear i said but she stood rigid in the doorway her face very white and set that beast she said peter you cant let this go on i met her eyes yes i can i replied if he wont tell us whats happened its probably something pretty sticky stennings quite right we cant wait all the ruddy night she wavered and i took her by the arm and led her away down the passage to that empty diningroom there was a bottle of some red wine there halfemptied i poured out a glass for her and made her drink it we said nothing to each other but after a little she began to busy herself with rearranging the coat about my bandaged arm in an incredibly short space of time stenning was with us again followed by fazzini and one or two of his men that fancy man wants a new arm he said harshly ive gone and broken that one for him i felt sheila stir beside me but i touched her on the shoulder what about lenden he wiped his bleeding knuckles absently upon his trousers lenden got away about an hour ago he said an hour to an hour and a half he took the plates with him managed to get hold of them in the confusion when they had the safe open and shot off for the hills dyou know which way he went stenning jerked his thumb eastwards that way fazzini says theres a hill path over to rocchetta that way in the next valley to this thats the way hes gone dyou know that yes half an hour after hed got away they got news here that someone had seen him on that path a couple of these russians went after him then maybe threequarters of an hour ago theyre not back yet he paused manek a chap called manek was one of them thats the name that trades union bloke was talking about isnt it i nodded a big chap with a fat white face i think hes a gunman probably said stenning anyone here got a gun i tugged my old automatic clumsily out of my pocket youd better take this thing i said itll be more good with you than with me he took it and stood for a moment in thought well get fazzini to wake up the rocchetta crowd on the telephone he said then wed best push on up the hill after mr ruddy manek and have a look what hes up to h swang round to fazzini and they talked rapidly together for a minute one of the officers joined them and then we were all back in that room with the safe where a weeping man with a hideously battered face and helpless arms was being roughly tended by his fascist guards one of the officers stood to the telephone on the wall in a minute or two he said something still working said stenning thats all right now wed better get away up that hill and pretty damn quick he swung round on me what about you and miss darle dyou think you can keep up sheila broke in well try give us a man as a guide to stay with us in case we drop behind right said stenning and swung round into a brisk conversation with fazzini with sheilas help i slipped off my overcoat and jacket and started on that walk in my cardigan sheila left her overcoat already the light was growing in a cloudless sky in another hour the sun would be up it was going to be a hot day on the hills we started from the house immediately six fascists and ourselves stenning and fazzini marched at the head sheila and i brought up the rear they set the devil of a pace up that hill all the italians were as hard as nails stenning was in fine training and sheila can outwalk most men that i know i was the one who felt it most i dare say i was as fit as any of them normally but i was very tired and the exertion played hell with my arm and fingers still i managed to keep up the track led straight up the hillside from the casa winding up among the olives and the carnations we went straight up at a fivemileanhour walk and as we went the dawn lightened upon us so that in half an hour it was light by the time we had left the terraces and were pressing on up one of the spurs of monte verde the path had shrunk to a foottrack that made us walk in single file that country was all pine trees and rosemary it was cool walking in the early morning and we made fine speed over the ground presently we topped one of the spurs and got a view of the mountainous country to the north and east it was at this point that the sun rose upon us over the foothills to the right there was a wide expanse of steely misty sea just beginning to show up i had thought that we should dip down into the opposite valley for rocchetta there but the path went winding on up the side of monte verde in a more gentle incline soon we came to a place of grassy slopes and the path began to wind along the hill on the edge of a set of miniature precipices thirty or forty feet deep it was sinuous here so that one would round a spur with no knowledge of the path ten yards ahead i was getting very tired by then and the arm was hurting me more than a little i was plodding along in the rear intent only on keeping up when there was a sort of scuffle from the front of the line a burst of italian and a good round oath from stenning pressing forward in the clamour i saw what had happened standing against the rock wall of the path their hands crooked above their heads there were two men a fascist was standing by them and going through the contents of their pockets while fazzini and stenning held them covered by their automatics and interrogated them in italian they had been coming down the path towards us and we had run straight into them one of the men was very broad in build but i should not have called him fat he had a broad white mongolian face a powerful man of his type and something of an athlete the other one was plainly italian i found later that he was a local man the fascist who was searching manek took from him an automatic pistol the russian eyed it phlegmatically as it passed from hand to hand stenning slipped out the magazine and glanced into the breech about four shots fired he said quietly he smelt the barrel and not so long ago he turned to fazzini you must make the little one talk captain he said in italian this one is no talker fazzini stood closer to the little italian and began speaking to him automatic in hand the barrel pressed close to the prisoners stomach and waggling a little i do not know what he was saying but they were townsmen and one could see the trend i was watching manek as he stood there covered by stenning and i saw his head turn anxiously perhaps threateningly to the man beside him stenning said something harshly and the man looked stolidly to his front again but by now the little man was talking and gesticulating volubly i saw stennings face harden to a mask as he jerked his head for me theyve shot up maurice he said curtly shot him up and left him on the hill weve got to get on this chap says hes alive all right there was a sudden cry from one of the italians who had gone ahead a little way up the path he was coming back with a black case in his hand a rectangular black box made of some oxidised metal i reached out my sound hand and took it from him as he approached it was closed and intact the russians eyes were fixed on it intently whats that asked stenning the plates i said they must have dropped them back there when they heard us coming he glanced at me inquiringly and i shook my head theyve not been touched so far as i can see wed better get along said stenning he jerked his pistol at the russian get on up that path and by god you give me half a chance and ill put a bullet in your guts get on we pressed on up the path manek leading with stennings pistol hard against the base of his spine behind them came fazzini with the italian prisoner walking free and talking all the time the rest of us followed in a tail by that time the sun was getting up above the hills and clearing away the mists in another hour it would be hot we carried on like that for half an hour or so longer then we came out upon the true shoulder of the hill before us lay the valley of the nervia with rocchetta below the path went level here and crossed a couple of little grassy swards among the pines and in this place we came to a little tenfoot cliff below the path that dropped down to a glade of rosemary and brush a little sort of cup with a grass floor that treaded away down the hill below the guide stopped and said something this is the place said stenning quietly and there at last we found him he had been shot upon the path because we found blood there and then he had rolled or they had tipped him over the edge of this little cliff into the bushes below he had crawled forward a little way from the rock face and he was lying face downwards on a patch of grass i saw him raise his head and stir a little at the sound of our voices and the clatter of the two italians who were scrambling down to him stenning swung round to the remaining fascists and pointed to manek with his gun guard him well he said harshly in italian for by the mother of god if that man dies he hangs for it then we went scrambling down into the little glade he had been shot from behind at very close range each of the three bullets had passed through the upper part of his body he was fully conscious and knew us all very gently we turned him over and began cutting his clothes away to get to his wounds and while we were doing that he spoke to me maneks been to the pictures he said thickly he did it with his little gun sheila sat down beside him lifting his head and making a pillow for him with a coat that one of the italians offered her and then she began wiping the blood and dirt from his face with her handkerchief brushing the long black hair back from his forehead manek wont use his little gun again in a hurry old toy i said weve got him safe up top there and as i spoke there was an uproar from the cliff above our heads and stenning and i started from the glade manek had kicked his guard in the stomach and made a dash for it he came leaping down the hill towards the valley some twenty yards from where we stood there was a sharp report beside me and i swung round stenning was leaning against a tree his face hard set i saw the smoke carling from the barrel of my automatic as he steadied his hand against the trunk and i saw him fire again that shot flicked the ground by the feet of the running man but he never stayed stenning fired three shots more three shots in very quick succession i saw the fugitive check for an instant he seemed to stumble it was as if he had put his foot on a loose stone then he pitched forward on to his face and went slithering face downwards down the steep slope of the hill till the curve of the ground hid him from our sight there was a long sigh beside me stenning stood up from the tree and glanced at me thats the end of mr ruddy manek he said brutally and with that he handed me my gun he had done with it and he went back to lenden in the glade and knelt down beside him cheeroh maurice he said quietly hows yere wattle he made a quick examination of his friend and stood up he spoke for a minute to fazzini i think he was telling him to send a man down to rocchetta for a doctor then he slipped off his golf jacket took off his shirt and began very methodically to tear it into bandages stenning said lenden painfully the other stooped towards him but did not stop his work i dont see how you come in on this flying for airways now old son said stenning i brought miss darle out here yesterday in a fifty professional interest flickered for a moment where did you put down this is the hell of a place for landing racecourse at nice said stenning you want to be careful there if youre ever using it theyve gone and cut it all up with little drains you want to put down at this end right by the rails one of the italians came up there with a little earthenware pot of water that he had got from some spring on the hill sheila dipped her handkerchief in it and wiped lendens face again brushing back the long hair that curled down over his forehead thats awfully good of you he said its nice his eyes wandered to me whats up with your arm i grinned at him its only sprained i came out here in your breguet and piled her up on landing im sorry about that youve crashed my kite i nodded he thought about it for a minute and then when did you fly last in the war i said and you got out here on that breguet i nodded again she got off the ground quite easily thats the part i had the wind up of but once that was over id only got to sit still till we got here he stared at me with wrinkled brows born to be hanged he muttered weakly thats what it is he had to stop talking then because stenning got busy with his dressings i was no good in that business with only one hand and so i stood aside and left it to the others then while that was going on i walked over the hill to where manek had been shot there were a couple of fascists beside the body they said something to me but i shook my head he must have been killed instantly i wondered if in italy that would be a manslaughter charge against stenning when i got back to the little glade the dressing was done stenning was on his feet again his bare hairy arms smeared with blood which he was trying absently to remove with a pad of grass i walked a little way aside with him wed better get a stretcher of some sort i said hes all right to move he stopped wiping his arms for a moment and looked me in the eyes i wouldnt try it there was no wind that morning on the hillside it was very still i could hear the two italians talking down by manek fifty yards away i can remember standing there and noticing a great scent of rosemary and pines te the warm summer of that day hes dying stenning didnt answer for a minute but stood there wiping his arm mechanically studying the spots of blood upon his skin yes he said heavily at last hes dying i dont think hes got a hope in hell unless its to keep still and he knows it himself and then he told me what was wrong and what he had done about it and i agreed with him and we went back together to the dying man in the glade sheila was leaning over and speaking to him and she motioned me to him as we approached he was very much weaker then i stooped down beside him so that he wouldnt have to raise his voice im damn sorry to have let you in on this moran he said you shouldnt have come out and then he said you ought to have put me down at the station that night like i asked you couldnt do that old boy i said quietly not on a night like that he shifted a little on his back and in an instant stenning was stooping anxiously to help him move its been a rum show he muttered when he was comfortable youve got crashed and ive got shot up and nothing gained the whole thing a ruddy failure there was a catch of disappointment in his voice he was getting very weak i glanced anxiously at sheila behind the range of his vision she shook her head i dont know about that i said weve got the plates you took of portsmouth you know we took em off manek for one moment i thought he was going to sit up you say youve got the plates you lie still i said and reached out for that black case one of the italians handed it to me theyre here quite all right the case hasnt been opened i put it into his hand so that he could feel it he lay there fingering it for a moment and then he handed it back to me open it up he said i could not have met sheilas eyes at that moment i had all that i could do to keep a steady face myself dyou want me to expose these chaps i asked he inclined his head painfully theres a little spring catch on the end he said a little button tve got it now i said and lifted off the cover plate he was insistent get the plates out and give them to me one by one he said there was a slide there held by a sort of lockingpin and underneath the slide there was a thin metal plate covered in black velvet that pulled out in the same way as the slide and under it i saw the greenish yellow of the first plate i lifted it out of the case and put it in his hand he laid it on his chest in the bright morning sunlight and played with it for a little holding it up and turning it about and presently he laid it down now the next he said there were twelve plates in that box each separated from the others by a velvet shield i gave them to him one by one he held each one for half a minute or so turning them all ways to the light and never speaking at all until we got to the tenth and then god damn it he said the suns going in the brilliant sunlight of that italian morning beat down upon us in the glade drenching the country with its golden glow and drawing the scent out of the rosemary on which he lay its only a little cloud old boy i said theres lashings of light left to cook these plates thats right he said faintly it was an awfully quick film they used we had a lot of trouble developing the practice ones i handed him the twelfth and last thats the lot i said youve got them all there now the box is empty he fingered the last plate for a little and laid it with the others thats a bloody good job done he sighed he was silent for a minute or so i thought it was the end but he roused himself again youre sure theyre cooked all right he inquired its getting so dark theyre done all right old boy i said youve made a proper job of it he sighed again well bust them up he said so i laid them together on the grass beside him and cracked them into very small pieces with the handle of my automatic and the sound of the tinkling glass reassured him a bit i think because miss darle he whispered i want to speak to miss darle sheila bent over him im here captain lenden she replied and wiped his face very gently with the water thats nice he said and then he began to speak to her about his wife and what he said was no concern of ours nor has it any place in this account it didnt take very long and at the end of it he said youll tell her that very gently sheila brushed the hair back from his forehead why yes ill tell her that but there isnt any need you know she knows it all already he sighed i know she does but i want you to tell her again just that its all all right he closed his eyes as if for sleep but presently he opened them again and said moran and i bent towards him how did you come to crash my kite doing a slow turn when i was coming in to land old boy i said something went wrong with it and we spun into the deck from about three hundred his voice had grown very faint you want to watch those slow turns on the breguet he said i had to put my ear practically to his lips to catch the words there was silence and then he said you dont want to use the rudder at all hardly just the bank and keep her nose stuffed down a bit and shell go round nicely about five minutes after that he died appendix so to the end i have little more to add to this account except two letters which i think can hardly be omitted six weeks after my return from italy a raid was carried out upon soviet house a great mass of correspondence was examined and a selection of this material dealing with matters of general interest was made available to the public in a white paper of the remainder two letters were found to bear directly on the death of maurice lenden and were brought to the notice of lord arner in connection with my own statement it is to be regretted that it has not proved possible to publish these interesting documents in their entirety the first letter is dated april th and is signed ast strokoff it is addressed from twentyseventh avenue new york and a portion of it reads in regard to the letters mentioned in your cable as being of especial importance i have good reason to believe that everything was destroyed by comrades sollar and manek i left the house and crossed the frontier with the others earlier in the night so that i can say nothing definite about this i shall be sending with comrade ogden a sworn statement upon the death of manek and i suggest that you should prepare a campaign of questions about this in the english parliament as soon as he arrives comrade jack atterley mp would be a good man to make this up and you should write an article about it for the worker the facts are that comrade manek was foully murdered in cold blood by the man stenning who shot him repeatedly through the body while he was held prisoner by the fascisti i am urging comrade ventoli to press this matter in italy but it is necessary to work more carefully in that country than in england owing to the injustice of their despotic government the extract from the second letter is quite short it is dated from moscow april nd and is signed by sanarowa minister of internal preparation as a memorial i think it may not be altogether unworthy of the man as for the airman maurice lenden this man proved difficult and uncertain in temper from the first and by no means devoted to the soviet doctrine in the end he proved weak and treacherous beyond all belief and has been the occasion of a considerable setback to our activities in europe it is recommended that no further confidence be placed in renegades of this description
