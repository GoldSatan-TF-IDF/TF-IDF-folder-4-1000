hey put that down i grabbed the comic book from wilson darks hand and smoothed out the plastic cover i was only looking at it he grumbled if you get a fingerprint on it it will lose half its value i told him i examined the cover through the clear wrapper this is a silver swan number zero i said and its in mint condition wilson shook his head he has curly whiteblond hair and round blue eyes he always looks confused how can it be number zero he asked that doesnt make any sense skipper wilson is a really good friend of mine but sometimes i think he dropped down from the planet mars he just doesnt know anything i held up the silver swan cover so he could see the big zero in the corner that makes it a collectors item i explained number zero comes before number one this comic is worth ten times as much as silver swan number one huh it is wilson scratched his curly hair he squatted down on the floor and started pawing through my carton of comic books how come all your comics are in these plastic bags skipper how can you read them see i told you wilson doesnt know anything read them i dont read them i replied if you read them they lose their value he stared up at me you dont read them i cant take them out of the bag i explained if i open the bag they wont be in mint condition anymore ooh this one is cool he exclaimed he pulled up a copy of star wolf the cover is metal its worthless i mumbled its a second printing he stared at the silvery cover turning it in his hands making it shine in the light cool he muttered his favorite word we were up in my room about an hour after dinner the sky was black outside my double windows it gets dark so early in winter not like on the silver swans planet orcos iii where the sun never sets and all the superheroes have to wear airconditioned costumes wilson came over to get the math homework he lives next door and he always leaves his math book at school so he always comes over to get the homework from me you should collect comic books i told him in about twenty years these will be worth millions i collect rubber stamps he said picking up a zsquad annual he studied the sneaker ad on the back cover rubber stamps yeah i have about a hundred of them he said what can you do with rubber stamps i asked he dropped the comic back into the carton and stood up well you can stamp things with them he said brushing off the knees of his jeans i have differentcolored ink pads or you can just look at them he is definitely weird are they valuable i asked he shook his head i dont think so he picked up the math sheet from the foot of my bed id better get home skipper see you tomorrow he started for the door and i followed him our reflections stared out at us from my big dresser mirror wilson is so tall and skinny and blond and blueeyed i always feel like a dark chubby mole next to him if we were in a comic book wilson would be the superhero and i would be his sidekick id be the pudgy funny one who was always messing up its a good thing life isnt a comic book right as soon as wilson left i turned back to my dresser my eye caught the big computer banner above the mirror skipper matthews alien avenger my dad had someone at his office print out the banner for me for my twelfth birthday a few weeks ago beneath the banner i have two great posters tacked on the wall on both sides of the dresser one is a jack kirby captain america its really old and probably worth about a thousand dollars the other one is newer a spawn poster by todd mcfarlane its really awesome in the mirror i could see the excited look on my own face as i hurried to the dresser the flat brown envelope waited for me on the dressertop mom and dad said i couldnt open it until after dinner after i finished my homework but i couldnt wait i could feel my heart start to pound as i stared down at the envelope i knew what waited inside it just thinking about it made my heart pound even harder i carefully picked up the envelope i had to open it now i had to carefully carefully i tore the flap on the envelope then i reached inside and pulled out the treasure this months issue of the masked mutant holding the comic book in both hands i studied the cover the masked mutant in jagged red letters across the bottom i read a tight squeeze for the sensational sponge the cover art was awesome it showed sponge life known across the universe as the sponge of steel in terrible trouble he was caught in the tentacles of a gigantic octopus the octopus was squeezing him dry awesome totally awesome i keep all of my comic books in mint condition wrapped in collectors bags but there is one comic that i have to read every month and thats the masked mutant i have to read it as soon as it comes out and i read it cover to cover every word in every panel i even read the letters page thats because the masked mutant is the bestdrawn bestwritten comic in the world and the masked mutant has to be the most powerful most evil villain ever created what makes him so terrifying is that he can move his molecules around that means he can change himself into anything thats solid anything on this cover the giant octopus is actually the masked mutant you can tell because the octopus is wearing the mask that the masked mutant always wears but he can change himself into any animal or any object thats how he always escapes from the league of good guys there are six different superheroes in the league of good guys they are all mutants too with amazing powers and they are the worlds best law enforcers but they cant catch the masked mutant even the leagues leader the galloping gazelle the fastest man in the solar system isnt fast enough to keep up with the masked mutant i studied the cover for a few minutes i liked the way the octopus tentacles squeezed spongelife into a limp rag you could see by his expression that the sponge of steel was in mortal pain awesome i carried the comic over to the bed and sprawled onto my stomach to read it the story began where the masked mutant left off spongelife the worlds best underwater swimmer was deep in the ocean he was desperately trying to escape from the masked mutant but the sponge of steel had caught his cape on the edge of a coral reef i turned the page as the masked mutant drew nearer he began to move his molecules around and he changed himself into a huge really gross octopus there were eight drawings showing the masked mutant transform himself and then came a big fullpage drawing showing the enormous octopus reaching out its slimy fat tentacles to grab the helpless spongelife spongelife struggled to pull away but the octopus tentacles slid closer closer i started to turn the page but before i could move i felt something cold and slimy wrap itself around my neck i let out a gasp and tried to struggle free but the cold tentacles wrapped themselves tighter around my throat i couldnt move i couldnt scream i heard laughter with a great effort i turned around and saw mitzi my nineyearold sister she pulled her hands away from my neck and jumped back as i glared at her why are your hands so cold i demanded she smiled at me with her innocent twodimpled smile i put them in the refrigerator you what i cried you put them in the refrigerator why so theyd be cold she replied still grinning my sister has a really dumb sense of humor she has straight dark brown hair like me and shes short and a little chubby like me you scared me to death i told her sitting up on the bed i know she replied she rubbed her hands on my cheeks they were still cold yuck get away mitzi i shoved her back why did you come up here just to scare me she shook her head dad told me to come up he said to tell you if youre reading comic books instead of doing your homework youre in big trouble she lowered her brown eyes to the comic book open on the bed guess youre in big trouble skipper no wait i grabbed her arm this is the new masked mutant i have to read it tell dad im doing my math and i didnt finish what i was saying because my dad stepped into the room the ceiling light reflected in his glasses but i could still see that he had his eyes on the open comic book on my bed skipper he said angrily in his booming deep voice mitzi pushed past him and ran out of the room she liked to cause trouble but she never wanted to stay around once things got really ugly and i knew things were about to get ugly because i had already been warned three times that week about spending too much time with my comic book collection skipper do you know why your grades are so bad my dad bellowed because im not a very good student i replied a mistake dad hates it when i answer back dad reminds me of a big bear not only because he growls a lot but because he is big and broad he has short black hair and almost no forehead really his hair starts almost right above his glasses and he has a big booming roar of a voice like a bears roar well after i answered him back he let out an angry roar then he lumbered across the room and picked up my carton of comic books my entire collection sorry skipper im tossing these all out he cried and headed for the door you probably expected me to panic to start begging and pleading for him not to throw away my valuable collection but i didnt say anything i just stood beside the bed with my hands lowered at my sides and waited you see dad has done this before lots of times but he doesnt really mean it he has a bad temper but hes no supervillain actually id put him in the league of good guys most of the time his main problem is that he doesnt approve of comic books he thinks theyre just trash even when i explain that my collection will probably be worth millions by the time im his age anyway i stood there and waited silently dad stopped at the door and turned around he held the carton in both hands he narrowed his dark eyes at me through his blackframed glasses are you going to get to your work he asked sternly i nodded yes sir i muttered staring at my feet he lowered the carton a little its really heavy even for a big strong guy like him and you wont waste any more time tonight on comic books he demanded couldnt i just finish this new one i asked i pointed to the masked mutant comic on the bed another mistake he growled at me and turned to carry the carton away okay okay i cried sorry ill get my homework done dad i promise ill start right now he grunted and stepped back into the room then he dropped the carton back against the wall thats all you think about night and day skipper he said quietly comics comics it isnt healthy really it isnt i didnt say anything i knew he was about to go back downstairs i dont want to hear any more about comics dad said gruffly understand okay i murmured sorry dad i waited to hear his heavy footsteps going down the stairs then i turned back to the new issue of the masked mutant i was desperate to find out how spongelife escaped from the giant octopus but i could hear mitzi nearby she was still upstairs if she saw me reading the comic book shed run downstairs and tell dad for sure mitzis hobby is being a snitch so i opened my backpack and started pulling out my math notebook and my science textbook and other stuff i needed i zipped through the math questions as fast as i could i probably got most of the problems wrong but it doesnt matter im not any good at math anyway then i read the chapter on atoms and molecules in my science text reading about molecules made me think about the masked mutant i couldnt wait to get back to the comic book i finally finished my homework a little after ninethirty i had to skip a few essay questions on the literature homework but only the class brains answer all of the questions i went downstairs and fixed myself a bowl of frosted flakes my favorite latenight snack then i said goodnight to my parents and hurried back up to my room closing the door behind me eager to get back in bed and start reading back under the ocean spongelife escaped by squishing himself so small he slipped out of the octopuss tentacles pretty cool i thought the masked mutant waved his tentacles angrily and vowed hed get spongelife another day then he changed his molecules back so he looked like himself and flew back to his headquarters his headquarters i stared down at the comic book in shock the secret headquarters of the masked mutant had never been shown before oh sure wed been given glimpses of a room or two on the inside but this was the first time the building had ever been shown from the outside i brought the page up close to my face and examined it carefully what a weird place i exclaimed out loud the headquarters building didnt look like any building i had ever seen before it certainly didnt look like the secret hideout of the worlds worst villain it kind of looked like a giant fire hydrant a very tall fire hydrant that reached up to the sky all pink stucco with a huge greendomed roof weird i repeated but of course it was the perfect hiding place who would ever think that the super bad guy of all time stayed in a building that looked like an enormous pink fire hydrant i turned the page the masked mutant slipped into the building and disappeared into an elevator he rode all the way to the top and stepped out into his private communications center waiting for him there was a big surprise a dark figure we could see only his black silhouette but i could tell instantly who it was it was the galloping gazelle leader of the league of good guys how did the gazelle get in what was he about to do to be continued next month wow i closed the comic my eyelids felt heavy my eyes were too tired to read the tiny type on the letters page i decided to save it for tomorrow yawning i carefully set the comic book down on my bed table i fell asleep before my head hit the pillow two days later a very cold clear day wilson came running up to me after school his blue coat was unzipped he never zipped his coat he didnt like the way it looked when it was zipped i had on a shirt a sweater and a heavy quilted down coat zipped up to my chin and i was still cold whats up wilson i asked his breath steamed up in front of him want to come over and see my rubber stamp collection was he kidding i have to go to my orthodontist i told him my braces got comfortable he has to tighten them so theyll hurt again wilson nodded his blue eyes matched his coat how are you getting there i pointed to the bus stop city bus i told him ive seen you take that bus a lot he said theres a comic book store on goodale street i replied shifting my backpack onto the other shoulder i take the bus there once a week or so to see what new comics have come out the orthodontist is just a few blocks from it do they have rubber stamps at the comic book store wilson asked i dont think so i told him i saw the blueandwhite city bus turn the corner got to run see you later i called i turned and ran full speed to the bus stop the driver was a nice guy he saw me running and waited for me breathing hard i thanked him and climbed on to the bus i probably wouldnt have thanked him if i had known where this bus was going to take me but i didnt know that it was carrying me to the most frightening adventure of my life the bus was unusually crowded i stood for a while then two people got off and i slid into a seat as the bus bounced along main street i stared out at the passing houses and front yards dark clouds hung low over the roofs i wondered if we were about to get our first snowfall of the winter the comic book store was a few blocks away i checked my watch thinking maybe i had time to stop there before my orthodontist appointment but no no time for comics today hey do you go to franklin a girls voice interrupted my thoughts i turned to see that a girl had taken the seat beside me her carrotcolored hair was tied back in a single braid she had green eyes and light freckles on her nose she wore a heavy blueandredplaid ski sweater over faded jeans she held her red canvas backpack in her lap yeah i go there i replied how is it she asked she narrowed her green eyes at me as if checking me out its okay i told her whats your name she asked skipper i told her she snickered thats not a real name is it its what everyone calls me i said do you live on a boat or something she asked her eyes crinkled up i could see she was laughing at me i guess skipper is kind of a dumb name but ive gotten used to it i like it a lot better than my real name bradley when i was a little kid i was always in a hurry i told her so i used to skip a lot thats why they started calling me skipper cute she replied with a smirk i dont think i like this girl i told myself whats your name i asked her skipper she replied grinning same as yours no really i insisted its libby she said finally libby zacks she stared past me out the window the bus stopped for a red light a baby started crying in the back where are you going libby asked me home i didnt want to tell her i had an orthodontist appointment that was too geeky im going to a comic book store i said the one on goodale you collect comics she sounded surprised so do i it was my turn to be surprised most of the comic book collectors i know are boys what kind do you collect i asked high school harry beanhead she replied i collect all the digestsized ones and some of the regular ones too yuck i made a face high school harry and his pal beanhead those comics stink they do not libby insisted those are for babies i muttered theyre not real comics theyre very well written libby replied and theyre funny she stuck her tongue out at me maybe you just dont get them yeah maybe i said rolling my eyes i gazed out the window the sky had grown darker i didnt recognize any of the stores i saw a restaurant called pearls and a tiny barbershop had we passed the comic book store libby folded her hands over her red backpack what do you collect all that superhero junk yeah i told her my collection is worth about a thousand dollars maybe two thousand in your dreams she shot back she laughed high school harry comics never go up in value i informed her even the number ones are worthless you couldnt get five dollars for your whole collection why would i want to sell them she argued i dont want to sell them and i dont care what theyre worth i just like to read them then youre not a real collector i said are all the boys at franklin like you libby asked no im the coolest one i declared we both laughed i still couldnt decide if i liked her or not she was pretty cutelooking and she was funny in a nasty sort of way i stopped laughing when i glanced out the window and realized i had definitely passed my stop i saw the bare trees of a small park id never seen before the bus rumbled past it and more unfamiliar stores came into view i felt a sudden stab of panic in my chest i didnt know this neighborhood at all i pushed the bell and jumped to my feet whats your problem libby demanded my stop i mmissed it i stammered she moved her legs into the aisle so that i could squeeze past the bus squealed to a stop i called out goodbye and hurried out the back door where am i i asked myself glancing around why did i let myself get into an argument with that girl why didnt i pay attention instead are you lost a voice asked i turned and saw to my surprise that libby had followed me off the bus what are you doing here i blurted out its my stop she replied i live two blocks down that way she pointed i have to go back i said turning to leave and as i turned something came into view that made my breath catch in my throat ohh i let out a startled cry and stared across the street but thats impossible i exclaimed i was staring at a tall building on the other corner a tall pink stucco building with a bright green domed roof i was staring at the secret headquarters of the masked mutant skipper whats wrong libby cried i couldnt answer her i stared goggleeyed at the building across the street my mouth dropped open my jaw nearly hit my knees i raised my eyes to the bright green roof then i slowly lowered them over the shiny pink walls i had never seen colors like these in real life they were comic book colors it was a comic book building but here it was standing on the corner across the street skipper are you okay libbys voice sounded far away its real i told myself the secret headquarters building of the masked mutant is real or is it two hands shook me by the shoulders snapping me out of my amazed thoughts skipper are you in shock or something ththat building i stammered isnt that the ugliest thing you ever saw libby asked shaking her head she pushed back her carrotcolored braid and hiked her backpack onto her shoulder but it its i still couldnt speak my dad says the architect had to be color blind libby said it doesnt even look like a building it looks like a blimp standing on its end how long has it been there i asked my eyes studying the glass doors that were the only entrance libby shrugged i dont know my family just moved here last spring it was already here the clouds darkened overhead a cold wind swirled around the corner who do you think works in there libby asked theres no sign or anything on the building of course theres no sign i thought its the secret headquarters of the worlds most evil villain theres no way the masked mutant would put a sign out front he doesnt want the league of good guys to find his secret headquarters i told myself this is crazy i cried i turned and saw libby staring at me you sure youre okay its just a building skipper no need to go ballistic i could feel my face turning red libby must think im some kind of a nut i realized i i think i saw this building somewhere i tried to explain ive got to get home she said glancing up at the darkening sky want to come over ill show you my comic book collection no im late for my orthodontist appointment i replied huh she narrowed her green eyes at me you said you were going to a comic book store i could feel my face turning even redder uh im going to the comic book store after my appointment i told her how long have you had your braces she asked i groaned forever she started backing away well see you sometime yeah bye she turned and jogged down the street she must think im a total geek i thought unhappily but i couldnt help it i really was in shock seeing that building i turned back to it the top of the building had become hidden by the lowering clouds now the building looked like a sleek pink rocket ship reaching up to the clouds a moving truck rumbled past i waited for it to go by then hurried across the street there was no one on the sidewalk i hadnt seen anyone go into the building or come out of it its just a big office building i told myself nothing to get excited about but my heart was pounding as i stopped a few feet from the glass doors at the entrance i took a deep breath and peeked in i know its crazy but i really expected to see people wearing superhero costumes walking around in there i narrowed my eyes and squinted through the glass doors i couldnt see anyone it appeared dark inside i took a step closer then another i brought my face right up to the glass and peered in i could see a wide lobby pinkandyellow walls a row of elevators near the back but no people no one empty i grabbed the glassdoor handle my throat made a loud gulping sound as i swallowed hard should i go in i asked myself do i dare my hand tightened on the glassdoor handle i started to tug the heavy door open then out of the corner of my eye i saw a blueandwhite bus moving toward me i glanced at my watch i was only five minutes late for my appointment if i jumped on the bus i could be at the orthodontists office in a few minutes letting go of the handle i turned and ran to the bus stop my backpack bouncing on my shoulders i felt disappointed but i also felt relieved walking into the headquarters of the meanest mutant in the universe was a little scary the bus eased to a stop i waited for an elderly man to step off then i climbed onboard dropped my money into the box and hurried to the back of the bus i wanted to get one last look at the mysterious pinkandgreen building two women were sitting in the back seat but i pushed between them and pressed my face against the back window as the bus pulled away i stared at the building its colors stayed bright even though the sky was so dark behind it the sidewalk was empty i still hadnt seen anyone come out or go inside a few seconds later the building disappeared into the distance i turned away from the window and walked up the aisle to find a seat weird i thought totally weird and it was the exact same building as in the comic book wilson asked his blue eyes stared across the lunchroom table at me i nodded as soon as i got home yesterday afternoon i checked out the comic book the building was exactly the same wilson pulled a sandwich from his lunch bag and started to unwrap the foil what kind of sandwich did your mom pack for you he asked i opened mine tuna salad whats yours he lifted a slice of bread and examined his sandwich tuna salad he replied want to trade we both have tuna salad i told him why do you want to trade he shrugged i dont know we traded sandwiches his moms tuna salad was better than mine i pulled the juice box from my lunch bag then i tossed the apple in the trash i keep telling mom not to pack an apple i told her i just throw it away every day why does she keep packing one can i have your pudding container i asked wilson no he replied i finished the first half of the sandwich i was thinking hard about the mysterious building id been thinking about it ever since i saw it ive solved the mystery wilson said he scratched his whiteblond curls a smile formed on his face yes ive solved it what i demanded eagerly its simple wilson replied who draws the masked mutant the artist i asked jimmy starenko of course starenko created the masked mutant and the league of good guys how could wilson not know that well ill bet this guy starenko was here one day wilson continued jabbing the straw into the top of his juice box starenko here in riverview falls i said i wasnt following him wilson nodded lets say starenko is here hes driving down the street and he sees the weird building he stops his car he gets out he stares at the building and he thinks what a great building this building would make a perfect secret headquarters building for the masked mutant wow i see i murmured i was catching on to wilsons thinking you mean he saw the building liked it and copied it when he drew the headquarters building wilson nodded he had a piece of celery stuck to his front tooth yeah maybe he got out of the car and sketched the building then he kept the sketches in a drawer or something till he needed them it made sense actually it made too much sense i felt really disappointed i knew it was silly but i really wanted that building to be the masked mutants secret headquarters wilson had spoiled everything why did he have to be so sensible for once i got some new rubber stamps he told me finishing the last spoonful from his pudding container want to see them i could bring them over to your house after school no thanks i replied that would be too exciting i planned to take the bus and go see the building again that afternoon but ms partridge gave us a ton of homework i had to go straight home the next day it snowed wilson and i and some other guys went sledding on grovers hill a week later i finally had a chance to go back and take another look at the building this time im going inside i told myself there must be a receptionist or a guard i decided ill ask whose building it is and who works there i was feeling really brave as i climbed on to the bus after school it was an ordinary office building after all nothing to get excited about taking a seat at the front of the bus i looked for libby the bus was filled with kids going home after school near the back i saw a redhaired girl arguing with another girl but it wasnt libby no sign of her i stared out the window as the bus rolled past the comic book store then a few blocks later we bounced past my orthodontists office just seeing his building made my teeth ache it was a sunny clear afternoon bright sunlight kept filling the bus windows forcing me to shield my eyes as i stared out i had to keep careful watch because i wasnt sure where the stop was i really didnt know this neighborhood at all kids were jammed in the aisle so i couldnt see out the windows on the other side of the bus i hope we havent already passed the building i thought i had a heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach i have a real fear of getting lost my mom says that when i was two she lost me for a few minutes in the frozen foods section at the pic n pay i think ive had a fear of getting lost ever since the bus pulled up to a bus stop i recognized the small park across the street this was the stop getting off i shouted jumping into the aisle i hit a boy with my backpack as i stumbled to the front door sorry getting off getting off i pushed through the crowd of kids and leaped down the steps onto the curb the bus rumbled away sunlight streamed around me i stepped to the corner yes this was the right stop i recognized it all now i turned and raised my eyes to the strange building and found myself staring at a large empty lot the building was gone whoa i cried frozen in shock shielding my eyes with one hand i stared across the street how could that enormous building vanish in one week i didnt have long to think about it another bus pulled up to the bus stop skipper hey skipper libby hopped off the bus waving and calling my name she was wearing the same redandblue ski sweater and faded jeans torn at one knee her hair was pulled straight back tied in a ponytail with a blue hair scrunchie hey what are you doing back in my neighborhood she asked smiling as she ran over to me ththat building i stammered pointing to the vacant lot its gone libbys expression changed well dont say hi or anything she muttered frowning at me hi i said what happened to that building she turned and followed my stare then she shrugged guess they tore it down but but i sputtered it was so ugly libby said maybe the city made them tear it down but did you see them tear it down i demanded impatiently you live near here right did you see them doing it she thought about it crinkling her green eyes as she thought well no she replied finally ive gone past here a few times but you didnt see any machinery i demanded anxiously any big wrecking balls any bulldozers dozens of workers libby shook her head no i didnt actually see anyone tearing the building down but i didnt really look she pulled her red backpack off her shoulder and held the strap in front of her with both hands i dont know why youre so interested in that ugly building skipper im glad its gone but it was in a comic book i blurted out huh she stared hard at me what are you talking about i knew she wouldnt understand nothing i muttered skipper did you come all the way out here just to see that building she asked no way i lied of course not do you want to come to my house and see my comic book collection i was so frazzled and mixed up i said yes i hurried out of libbys house less than an hour later those high school harry beanhead comics are the most boring comics in the world and the art is so lame cant everyone see that the two girls are drawn exactly the same except one has blond hair and one has black yuck libby insisted on showing me every high school harry beanhead comic she had and she had shelves full of them of course i couldnt concentrate on those boring comics i couldnt stop thinking about the weird building how could a whole building vanish without a trace i jogged back to the bus stop on main street the sun was sinking behind the buildings long blue shadows tilted over the sidewalks when i get to the corner i bet the building will be back i found myself thinking but of course it wasnt i know i know i have weird thoughts i guess it comes from reading too many comic books i had to wait nearly half an hour for the bus to come i spent the whole time staring at the empty lot thinking about the vanished building when i finally got home i found a brown envelope waiting for me on the little table in the hall where mom drops the mail yes i exclaimed happily the special issue of the masked mutant the comics company was sending out two special editions this month and this was the first i called hi to my mom tossed my coat and heavy backpack onto the floor and raced up the stairs to my room the comic book gripped tightly in my hot little hand i couldnt wait to see what had happened after the galloping gazelle sneaked into the masked mutants headquarters carefully i slid the comic book out of the envelope and examined the cover and there it stood the pinkandgreen headquarters building right on the cover my hand trembled as i opened to the first page morning of a mutant was the big title in scary red letters the masked mutant stood in front of a big communications console he stared into a wall of about twenty tv monitors each tv monitor showed a different member of the league of good guys im tracking each one of them the masked mutant said in the first dialogue balloon theyll never find me ive thrown an invisibility curtain around my entire headquarters my mouth dropped open as i read those words i read them three times before i let the comic book slip out of my hands to my bed an invisibility curtain no one can see the masked mutants building because he slipped an invisibility curtain around it i sat excitedly on the edge of my bed breathing hard feeling the blood pulse at my temples is that what happened in real life is that why i couldnt see the pinkandgreen building this afternoon was the comic book giving me the answer to the mystery of the missing building it sounded crazy it sounded totally crazy but was it real was there really an invisibility curtain hiding the building my head was spinning faster than the amazing tornadoman i knew only one thing i had to go back there and find out after school the next afternoon i had to go with my mom to the mall to buy sneakers i usually try on at least ten or twelve pairs then beg for the most expensive ones you know the ones that pump up or flash lights when you walk in them but this time i bought the first pair i saw plain blackandwhite reeboks i mean who could think about sneakers when an invisible building was waiting to be discovered driving home from the mall i started to tell mom about the building but she stopped me after a few sentences i wish you were as interested in your schoolwork as you are in those dumb comics she said sighing thats what she always says when is the last time you read a good book she continued thats the next thing she always says i decided to change the subject we dissected a worm today for science i told her she made a disgusted face doesnt your teacher have anything better to do than to cut up poor innocent worms there was just no pleasing mom today the next afternoon wearing my new sneakers i eagerly hopped on the city bus tossing my token into the box i saw libby sitting near the back as the bus lurched away from the curb i stumbled down the aisle and dropped beside her lowering my backpack to the floor im going back to that building i said breathlessly i think theres an invisibility curtain around it dont you ever say hi she complained rolling her eyes i said hi then i repeated what i had said about the invisibility curtain i told her i read about it in the newest masked mutant comic and that the comic may be giving clues as to what was happening in real life libby listened to me intently not blinking not moving i could see that she was finally starting to see why i was so excited about finding this building when i finished explaining everything she put a hand on my forehead you dont feel hot she said are you seeing a shrink huh i pushed her hand away are you seeing a shrink youre totally out of your mind you know that dont you im not crazy i said ill prove it come with me she edged closer to the window as if trying to get away from me no way she declared i cant believe im sitting here with a boy who thinks that comic books come to life she pointed out the window hey look skipper there goes the easter bunny hes handing an egg to the tooth fairy she laughed a mean laugh haha i muttered angrily i have a good sense of humor but i dont like being laughed at by girls who collect high school harry beanhead comics the bus pulled up to the bus stop i hoisted my backpack and scrambled out the back exit libby stepped off right behind me as the bus pulled away sending out puffs of black exhaust behind it i gazed across the street no building an empty lot well i turned to libby you coming she twisted her mouth into a thoughtful expression to that empty lot skipper arent you going to feel like a jerk when theres nothing there well go home then i told her sharply okay ill come she said grinning we crossed the street two teenagers on bikes nearly ran us over missed em one of them cried the other one laughed how do we get through the invisibility curtain libby asked her voice sounded serious but i could see by her eyes that she was laughing at me in the comic book people just stepped through it i told her you cant feel it or anything its like a smoke screen but once you step through it you can see the building okay lets try it libby said she tossed her ponytail over her shoulder lets get this over with okay walking side by side we took a step across the sidewalk toward the empty lot then another step then another we crossed the sidewalk and stepped onto the hard dirt i cant believe im doing this libby grumbled we took another step i cant believe im she stopped because the building popped into view ohhh we both cried out in unison she grabbed my wrist and squeezed it hard her hand was icecold we stood a few feet from the glass entrance the bright walls of the pinkandgreen building rose above us you you were right libby stammered still squeezing my wrist i swallowed hard i tried to talk but my mouth was suddenly too dry i coughed and no words came out now what libby asked staring up at the shiny walls i still couldnt speak the comic book is real i thought the comic book is real does that mean the building really belongs to the masked mutant whoa i warned myself to slow down my heart was already racing faster than speedboy now what libby repeated impatiently lets get away from here okay for the first time she sounded really frightened no way i told her come on lets go in she tugged me back go in are you crazy we have to i told her come on dont stop to think about it lets go i took a deep breath pulled open the heavy glass door and we slipped inside we took one step into the brightly lit lobby my heart was pounding so hard my chest hurt my knees were shaking id never been so scared in my life i glanced quickly all around the lobby was enormous it seemed to stretch on forever the pinkandyellow walls gave off a soft glow the sparkly white ceiling seemed to be a mile above our heads i didnt see a reception desk no chairs or tables no furniture of any kind where is everyone libby whispered i could see that she was frightened too she clung to my arm standing close beside me the vast room was empty not another person in sight i took another step and heard a soft beep a beam of yellow light shot out of the wall and rolled down over my body i felt a gentle tingling kind of a prickly feeling the kind of feeling when your arm goes to sleep it swept down quickly from my head to my feet a second or two later the light vanished and the tingly feeling went away what was that i whispered to libby what was what she replied didnt you feel that she shook her head i didnt feel anything are you trying to scare me or something skipper it was some kind of electric beam i told her it shined on me when i stepped forward lets get out of here she muttered its so quiet its creepy i turned my eyes to the row of elevators against the yellow wall did i dare take a ride on one was i brave enough to do a little exploring it its just a big office building i told libby trying to work up my courage well if its an office building where are the workers she demanded maybe the offices are closed i suggested on a thursday libby replied it isnt a holiday or anything i think the building is empty skipper i dont think anyone works here i took a few steps toward the elevators my sneakers thudded loudly on the hard marble floor but all the lights are on libby i said and the door was open she hurried to catch up to me her eyes kept darting back and forth i could see she was really scared i know what youre thinking she said you dont think this is just an office building you think this is the secret headquarters of that comic book character dont you skipper i swallowed hard my knees were still shaking i tried to make them stop but they wouldnt well maybe it is i replied staring at the elevators across from us i mean how do you explain the invisibility curtain it was in the comic book and it was outside this building i i cant explain it libby stammered its weird its too weird this place gives me the creeps skipper i really think theres only one way to find out the truth i said i tried to sound brave but my voice shook nearly as much as my knees libby followed my gaze to the elevators she guessed what i was thinking no way she cried stepping back toward the glass doors well just ride up and down i told her maybe open the elevator doors on a few floors and peek out no way libby repeated her face suddenly appeared very pale her green eyes were wide with fright libby it will only take a minute i insisted weve come this far i have to explore a little i dont want to go home without finding out what this building is you can ride the elevators she said im going home she backed up to the glass doors outside i saw a blueandwhite bus stop at the curb a woman climbed off carrying a baby in one hand dragging a stroller in the other i could run out the door and climb right onto that bus i thought i could get out of here safe and sound and be on my way home but what would happen when i got home i would feel like a coward a total wimp and i would spend day after day wondering about this building wondering if i had actually discovered the secret headquarters of a real supervillain if i jumped on the bus and rode home now the building would still be a mystery and the mystery would drive me crazy okay libby you can go home if you want i told her im going to ride the elevator to the top and back she stared at me thoughtfully then she rolled her eyes okay okay ill come with you she murmured shaking her head i was glad i really didnt want to go alone im only doing this because i feel sorry for you libby said following me across the marble floor to the elevators huh why do you feel sorry for me i demanded because youre so messed up she replied you really think a comic book can come to life thats sad thats really sad thank goodness high school harry and beanhead cant come to life i teased then i added what about the invisibility curtain that was real wasnt it libby didnt reply instead she laughed youre serious about this she said the sound of her laughter echoed in the enormous empty lobby it made me feel a little braver i laughed too whats the big deal i asked myself so youre going to take an elevator ride so what its not like the masked mutant is going to jump into the elevator with us i assured myself well probably peek out at a lot of boring offices and thats all i pushed the lighted button on the wall instantly the silvery elevator door in front of us slid open i poked my head into the elevator it had walls of dark brown wood with a silver railing that went all the way around there were no signs on the walls no building directory no words at all i suddenly realized there were no signs in the lobby either not even a sign with the name of the building or a sign to tell visitors where to check in weird lets go i said libby held back i tugged her by the arm into the elevator the doors slid shut silently behind us as soon as we stepped in i turned to the control panel to the left of the door it was a long silvery rectangle filled with buttons i pushed the button to the top floor the elevator started to hum it jerked slightly as we began to move i turned to libby she had her back pressed against the back wall her hands shoved into her jeans pockets she stared straight ahead at the door were moving i murmured the elevator picked up speed hey libby and i both cried out at the same time we were going down i exclaimed i had pushed the button to the top floor but we were dropping fast faster i grabbed the railing with both hands where was it taking us would it ever stop the elevator stopped with a hard thud that made my knees bend whoa i cried i let go of the railing and turned to libby beside me you okay she nodded she stared straight ahead at the elevator door we should have gone up i muttered tensely i pushed up why doesnt the door open libby asked in a trembling voice we both stared at the door i stepped to the center of the elevator open i commanded it the door didnt move were trapped in here libby said her voice getting shrill and tiny no i replied still trying to be the brave one itll open watch its just slow the door didnt open the elevator must be broken libby wailed well be trapped down here forever the air is starting to run out already i cant breathe dont panic i warned struggling to keep my voice calm take a deep breath libby theres plenty of air she obediently sucked in a deep breath she let it out in a long whoosh why wont the door open i knew we shouldnt have done this i turned to the control panel a button at the bottom read open i pushed it instantly the door slid open i turned back to libby see were okay but where are we she cried i stepped to the doorway and poked my head out it was very dark i could see some kind of heavy machinery in the darkness were in the basement i think i told libby there are all kinds of pipes and a big furnace and things lets go libby urged hanging back against the elevator wall i took a step out the door and glanced both ways i couldnt see much more machinery a row of metal trash cans a stack of long metal boxes come on skipper libby demanded lets go back up now i stepped back into the elevator and pushed the button marked lobby the door didnt close the elevator didnt move didnt hum i pushed lobby again i pushed it five or six times nothing happened i suddenly had a lump in my throat as big as a watermelon i really didnt want to be stuck down in this dark basement i started pushing buttons wildly i pushed everything i pushed a red button marked emergency five or six times nothing i dont believe this i choked out lets get out and take a different elevator libby suggested good idea i thought there was a long row of elevators up in the lobby well just get out of this one and push the button for another one to come down and get us i led the way out into the dark basement libby stayed close behind me oh we both let out low cries as the elevator door quickly slid shut behind us whats going on i demanded why wouldnt it close before libby didnt reply i waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness then i saw what libby was staring at where are the other elevators she cried we were staring at a smooth bare wall the elevator that had brought us down here was the only elevator on the wall i spun around checking out the other walls but it was too dark to see very far the other elevators dont come down here i guess libby murmured in a trembling voice i searched the wall for a button to push to bring our elevator back i couldnt find one no button theres no way out libby wailed no way out at all maybe there are elevators on the other wall i said pointing across the huge dark room maybe libby repeated doubtfully maybe theres a stairway or something i said maybe she said softly a sudden noise made me jump a rumble followed by a grinding hum just the furnace starting up i told libby lets find a way out of here she urged im never going in an elevator again as long as i live i could feel her hand on my shoulder as i started to make my way through the darkness the huge gray furnace rumbled and coughed another big machine made a soft clattering sound as we edged past it anybody down here i called my voice echoed off the long dustcovered pipes that ran along the low ceiling above our heads i cupped my hands around my mouth and called again anybody here can anybody hear me silence the only sounds i could hear were the rumble of the furnace and the soft scrape of our sneakers as libby and i slowly crept over the floor as we came near the far wall we could see that there were no elevators over here the smooth plaster wall was bare except for a thick tangle of cobwebs up near the ceiling theres got to be some stairs leading out of here libby whispered close behind me dim light shone through a narrow doorway up ahead lets see where this leads i said brushing stringy spiderwebs off my face we stepped through the doorway and found ourselves in a long hallway dustcovered ceiling bulbs cast pale light onto the concrete floor anybody here i called again my voice sounded hollow in the long tunnel of a hallway no reply dark doorways lined both sides of the hallway i peeked into each door as we passed i saw stacks of cartons tall file cabinets strange machinery i didnt recognize one large room was jammed with enormous coils of metal cable another room had sheets of metal piled nearly to the ceiling helloooooo i called helllooooooo no reply flashing red lights inside a large room caught my eye i stopped at the doorway and stared in at some sort of control panel one wall was filled with blinking red and green lights in front of the lights stood a long counter of dials and gears and levers three tall stools were placed along the counter but no one sat in them no one worked the controls the room was empty as empty as the rest of this strange frightening basement weird huh i whispered to libby when she didnt answer i turned to make sure she was okay libby she was gone i spun around libby my entire body shook where are you i squinted back down the long gray hallway no sign of her libby if this is some kind of a dumb joke i started but the rest of my words caught in my throat breathing hard i forced myself to retrace our steps libby i stopped at every door and called her name libby the hallway curved and i followed it i began jogging my hands down stiffly at my sides calling her name searching every door peering into every dark room how could she get lost i asked myself feeling my panic rise until i could barely breathe she was right behind me i turned another corner into a hallway i hadnt explored yet libby the narrow hall led to an enormous brightly lit room i had to shut my eyes against the sudden bright light when i opened them i found myself nearly facetoface with a gigantic machine bright floodlights from the high ceiling covered it in light the machine had to be a block long a big control panel filled with dials and buttons and lights stood against the side a long flat part like a conveyor belt led to several rollers and at the very end of the machine stood a huge white wheel no a cylinder no a roll of white paper its a printing press i realized i lurched into the room stepping around stacks of paper and cardboard cartons the floor was littered with paper inksmeared paper crumpled folded and ripped as i staggered toward the huge printing press the sea of paper rose up nearly to my knees libby are you in here libby silence this room was as empty as all the others the paper crackled under my sneakers i made my way to a long table at the back of the room i found a red stool in front of the table and i dropped down on it i kicked big sheets of paper away from my legs and glanced around the room a hundred questions pushed into my mind at once where is libby how could she disappear like that is she somewhere close behind me will she follow the hallway to this big room where is everyone why is this place totally deserted is this where they print the comic books am i in the basement of collectable comics the company that publishes the masked mutant questions questions my brain felt about to burst i stared around the cluttered room my eyes rolling past the gigantic printing press searching for libby where was she where i turned back to the table and gasped i nearly toppled off the stool the masked mutant was staring up at me a large color drawing of the masked mutant stared up at me from the table startled i picked it up and examined it it had been drawn on thick posterboard in colored inks the masked mutants cape swept behind him through his mask his eyes appeared to stare out at me evil angry eyes the ink glistened on the page as if still wet i rubbed my thumb over an edge of the cape the ink didnt come off i wonder if starenko drew this portrait i thought studying it glancing across the table i saw a stack of papers on a low counter that ran along the entire back wall hopping off the tall stool i made my way over to the counter and began shuffling through the papers they were ink drawings and pencil sketches many of them were of the masked mutant they showed him in different poses some of them showed him moving his molecules around changing into wild animals and strange unearthly creatures i opened a thick folder and found about a dozen color sketches of the members of the league of good guys then i found a stack of pencil drawings of characters id never seen before this must be where they make the comic books i told myself i was so excited about seeing these actual drawings and sketches i nearly forgot about libby this pinkandgreen building must be the headquarters of collectable comics i realized i was starting to feel calmer my fears dropped away like feathers off the battling birdboy after all there was nothing to be afraid of i hadnt stumbled into the headquarters of the worlds most evil supervillain i was in the basement of the comic book offices this is where the writers and artists worked and this is where they print the comic books every month so why should i be afraid i shuffled through folder after folder making my way down the long counter i found a pile of layouts for a comic book that i had just bought it was so exciting seeing the actual art the page was really big at least twice as big as the comic book i guessed that the artists made their drawings much bigger than the actual page and then they shrank the drawings down when they printed them i found some really new pencil drawings of the masked mutant i knew they were new because i didnt recognize them from my comics at home and i have them all drawing after drawing my eyes were practically spinning i never dreamed that collectable comics were made right in riverview falls i flipped through a sketchbook of penguin people portraits i never liked the penguin people i know theyre good guys and people really think theyre great but i think their blackandwhite costumes just look silly i was having a great time really enjoying myself of course it had to end it ended when i opened the last folder on the counter and stared at the sketches inside i gaped at them in disbelief my hands trembling as i shuffled from one to the next this is impossible i cried out loud i was staring at sketches of me i frantically shuffled through the big stack of drawings youre just imagining it skipper i told myself the boy in the sketches only looks like you it isnt really you but it had to be me in every drawing the boy had my round face my dark hair cut short on the sides and long on top he was short like me and just a little bit chubby he had my crooked smile up a little higher on one side he wore my clothes baggy jeans and longsleeved pocket tshirts i stopped at a drawing halfway through the pile and stared hard at it holding it close to my face oh wow i exclaimed the boy in the drawing even had a chip on his front tooth just like me its impossible i cried out loud my voice tiny and shrill in the enormous room who had been drawing me and why why would a comic book artist make sketch after sketch of me and how did the artist know me so well how did the artist know that i have a tiny chip on one front tooth a cold shiver ran down my back i suddenly felt very frightened i stared at the drawings my heart pounding in one drawing i looked really scared i was running from something my arms out stiffly in front of me another drawing was a closeup portrait of my face my expression in the sketch was angry no more than angry i looked furious another sketch showed me flexing my muscles hey i look pretty cool i thought the artist had given me bulging superhero biceps in another drawing my eyes were closed was i asleep or was i dead i was still staring at the drawings shuffling from one to the next studying each one when i heard the footsteps and realized i was no longer alone whowhos there i cried whirling around where were you libby demanded angrily running across the room toward me i searched everywhere where were you i shot back i thought you were right behind me i thought you were right ahead of me she cried i turned a corner and you were gone she stopped in front of me breathing hard her face bright red how could you leave me by myself in this creepy place i didnt i insisted you left me she shook her head still gasping for breath well lets get wit of here skipper i found some elevators that are working she tugged my sleeve i picked up the stack of drawings look libby i held them up to her you have to see these are you serious she cried i want to get out of here i dont want to look at comic book drawings now but but i sputtered waving the drawings she turned and started toward the doorway i told you i found some elevators are you coming or not but these are drawings of we i cried yeah sure she called back sarcastically she stopped at the front of the big printing press and turned back to me why would anyone draw you skipper ii dont know i stammered but these drawings you have a sick imagination she said you seem like a normal guy but youre totally weird bye libby started jogging over the papercluttered floor to the door no wait i called i dropped the drawings onto the counter slid off the tall stool and chased after her wait up libby i followed her out into the hall i didnt want to be left alone in this creepy place either i had to get home and think about this i had to puzzle it out my head was spinning i felt totally confused i followed her through the long tunnel of hallways we turned a corner and i saw a row of elevators against the wall libby pushed the button on the wall and one of the elevators slid open silently we both peered carefully inside before stepping on it was empty we were both panting my head was throbbing my side ached neither of us spoke a word libby pushed the button marked lobby we heard a soft hum and felt the elevator start to move when the door slid open and we saw the pinkandyellow walls of the lobby libby and i both cheered we burst out of the elevator together and ran across the marble floor to the exit out on the sidewalk i stopped lowering my hands to my knees sucking in deep breaths of fresh air when i glanced up i saw libby studying her watch ive got to get home she said my mom is going to have a cow do you believe me about the drawings i asked breathlessly no she replied who would believe that she waved and made her way across the street heading for home i could see a bus approaching a few blocks down searching in my jeans pocket for a token i turned to take one last look at the weird building it had vanished once again i needed time to think about everything that had happened but wilson was waiting for me when i got home and he followed me up to my room i brought over some of my rubber stamps he said raising a brown paper bag up to my face he turned it over and emptied it onto my desk i thought you might like to see some of the better ones wilson i started i really dont this one is a ladybug he said holding up a small wooden stamp its very old its the oldest one i own here ill show it to you he opened a blue inkpad stamped the ladybug on it and pressed it onto the top of a pad of paper i had on the desk how old is it i asked him i dont know he replied he held up another one its a cow he said as if i couldnt tell he stamped it onto the pad i have several cows wilson said but i only brought one i studied the cow pretending to be interested its another really old one wilson said proudly how old i asked he shrugged beats me he reached for another stamp uh wilson i just had a really weird thing happen i told him and i need to think about it alone he narrowed his blue eyes at me confused what happened its kind of a long story i said i was in a building on the north side of town i think its where they make the collectable comics really here in riverview falls wilsons face filled with surprise and they let you in there was no one there i told him it felt good to share the story with someone so we went in this girl i met on the bus libby and me we tried to go up in the elevator but it took us down then libby got lost and i found a stack of drawings of myself whoa wilson exclaimed raising a hand for me to stop im not following this too well skipper i realized what i had said didnt make any sense at all how could i explain it i told wilson id talk to him later after i calmed down i helped him gather up his rubber stamps hed brought about twenty of them twenty of the best he said i walked him downstairs and said id call him after dinner after he left something caught my eye on the mail table in the hall a brown envelope my heart jumped was it yes an envelope from the collectable comics company the next special issue of the masked mutant i was so excited i nearly knocked the whole table over as i grabbed for the envelope i tucked it under my arm without opening it and ran up the stairs two at a time i need total privacy i have to study this i told myself i closed the bedroom door behind me and dropped down onto the edge of the bed my hands trembled as i ripped open the envelope and pulled out the comic book the cover showed a closeup of the masked mutant his eyes glared angrily out at the reader a new foe for the mutant proclaimed the title huh a new foe i took a deep breath and held it calm down skipper i urged myself its only a comic book but would this new issue help to solve the mystery for me would it tell me anything about the strange pinkandgreen headquarters building would it help solve any of the puzzles from this afternoon i turned to the first page it showed the headquarters building from above the next drawing showed the building at street level in the deep shadows someone was approaching the glass doors someone was sneaking into the headquarters building i turned the page and shrieked at the top of my lungs i dont believe it yes you probably guessed it it was me sneaking into the masked mutants headquarters building i stared at the page so hard i thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head i was so excited and so shocked i couldnt read the words they became a gray blur i turned the pages with shaking hands i dont think i took a breath i studied each picture holding the comic book about an inch from my face the galloping gazelle sat in a tiny room the room grew hotter and hotter in minutes the galloping gazelle would become the boiled gazelle the masked mutant had trapped the galloping gazelle in his headquarters and now he planned to leave the gazelle there to boil i turned the page my hand shook so hard i nearly tore the page off there i was creeping through the dark hallway in the comic i wore the same tshirt and baggy jeans i had on right now the next drawing showed a closeup of my face big balls of sweat rolled down my pink face i guess that meant i was scared im a little too chubby in that drawing i thought but it was me it was definitely me mom i screamed closing the comic and jumping off the bed mom dad you have to see this i tore out of my room and hurtled down the stairs i dont think my feet touched the floor mom dad where are you i found them in the kitchen preparing dinner dad was chopping onions by the sink his eyes were filled with tears mom was bent over the stove as usual she was having trouble getting the oven lit im in this comic book i cried bursting into the room not now they both replied in unison no you have to see this i insisted waving it in front of dad dad didnt stop chopping you had a letter to the editor published he asked through his tears no im in the comic i told him breathlessly i waved it closer to him i cant see a thing dad exclaimed get that away from me cant you see what this onion is doing to my eyes theres a trick to chopping onions mom said bent over the stove but i dont know what it is i ran over to mom you have to check this out mom im in here look its really me mom shook her head frowning i cant get it to light she said sighing i think the pilot is out again ill check it if i ever stop crying dad told her will you look at this i screamed totally losing it mom gave a quick glance to the page i was holding in front of her yes yes that does look a little like you skipper she said waving me away she turned back to the oven we really need a new stove dear dad take a look i pleaded i ran back to him but he had shoved a towel up to his face and was crying into the towel i guess you cant look now huh i said softly he didnt answer he just cried into the towel i let out a long exasperated moan what was their problem anyway this was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me and they couldnt be bothered to take one look angrily i closed the comic and stomped out of the room skipper set the table mom shouted after me set the table im starring in a famous comic book and shes asking me to set the table why cant mitzi do it i asked set the table skipper mom repeated sternly okay okay in a few minutes i called back i dropped down onto the living room couch and turned to the back of the comic i had been too excited to read it to the end now i wanted to read the part where it tells you what to expect in the next comic book my eyes swept over the page there was the galloping gazelle still trapped in the boiling hot room and there stood the masked mutant outside the door about to declare his victory i squinted at the white thought balloon over the galloping gazelles head what was he saying only the boy can save me now the galloping gazelle was thinking only the boy can save the world from the masked mutants evil but where is he i read it again and again was it true was i the only one who could save the galloping gazelle did i really have to go back there after school the next day i hurried to the bus stop it was a clear cold day the ground beneath my sneakers was frozen hard the sky above looked like a broad sheet of cold blue ice leaning into the sharp wind i wondered if libby would be on the bus i was dying to tell her about the comic book i wanted to tell her i was going back into the strange building would she go back with me no way i decided libby had been frightened after our first visit i could never drag her back there i jogged past the playground my eyes on the street watching for a bus hey skipper a familiar voice called i turned to see wilson running after me his coat unzipped and flapping up behind him like wings skipper whats up you going home two blocks up the blueandwhite bus turned the corner no im going someplace i told wilson i cant look at your rubber stamp collection now his expression turned serious im not collecting rubber stamps anymore he said i gave it up i couldnt hide my surprise huh how come they took up too much of my time he replied the bus pulled to the curb the door opened see you later i told wilson as i stepped on to the bus i remembered where i was going and i suddenly wondered if i would see wilson later i wondered if i would ever see him again libby wasnt on the bus in a way i was glad it meant i wouldnt have to explain to her what i was doing she would have laughed at me for believing what i read in a comic book but the comic book had told the truth about the invisibility curtain and now it had said that i was the only one who could save the galloping gazelle and stop the masked mutants evil but its just a comic book libby would have said how can you be such a jerk to believe a comic book thats what she would have said and i dont know how i could have answered so i was glad she wasnt on the bus i climbed off the bus in front of the empty lot i gazed at it from across the street i knew it wasnt really an empty lot i knew the pinkandgreen building was there hidden behind the invisibility curtain as i crossed the street i felt a wave of fear sweep down over me my mouth suddenly got dry i tried to swallow but nearly choked my throat felt as if someone had tied a knot in it my stomach felt kind of fluttery and my knees got sweaty and refused to bend i stopped on the sidewalk and struggled to calm myself down its just a comic book just a comic book thats what i told myself repeating the words over and over finally staring straight ahead at the empty lot i worked up my courage enough to move forward one step another another suddenly the building popped into view i gasped even though i had crossed through the invisibility curtain before it was still amazing to see a building suddenly appear before my eyes swallowing hard i pulled open one of the glass entrance doors and stepped into the bright pinkandyellow lobby staying near the door i turned to the left then the right still empty not a person in sight i coughed my cough sounded tiny in the huge lobby my sneakers squeaked over the marble floor as i started to the elevators on the far wall where is everyone i asked myself its the middle of the afternoon how can i be the only one in this huge lobby i stopped in front of the elevators i raised my finger to the elevator button but i didnt push it i wish libby had come along i decided if libby were here at least id have someone to be terrifed with i pushed the elevator button well here goes i murmured waiting for the door to open and then someone laughed a cold evil laugh right behind me i let out a low cry and spun around no one there the laughter repeated soft but cruel my eyes darted around the lobby i couldnt see anyone whwhos there i choked out the laughter stopped i continued to search my eyes went up to the wall above the elevator a small black loudspeaker poked out from the yellow wall the laughter must have come from there i decided i stared up at it as if i expected to see someone in there get out of here a voice inside me begged my sensible voice just turn around skipper and run out of this building as fast as your rubbery shaky legs will take you i ignored it and pressed the elevator button the elevator door on the left slid open silently and i stepped inside the door closed i stared at the control panel should i push up or down the last visit i had pushed up the top floor and the elevator had taken libby and me down to the basement my finger hesitated in front of the buttons what would happen if this time i pushed down i didnt get a chance to find out the elevator started with a jolt before i pushed any button at all i grabbed on to the railing my hand was cold and wet the elevator hummed as it rose im going up i realized up to where the ride seemed to take forever i watched the floor numbers whir by on top of the control panel forty fortyone fortytwo the elevator beeped each time it passed a floor it came to a stop at fortysix was this the top floor the door slid open i let go of the railing and stepped out i glanced down a long gray hallway i blinked once twice it looked as if i had stepped into a blackandwhite movie the walls were gray the ceiling was gray the floor was gray the doors on both sides of the hall were gray it feels like im standing in a thick gray fog i thought peering one way then the other or in a dark cloud no one in sight nothing moving i listened hard listened for voices for laughter for the click and hum of office machinery silence except for the thudding of my heart i shoved my cold clammy hands into the pockets of my jeans and began to walk slowly following the hallway i turned a corner and stared down another endless gray hallway the end of the hall seemed to fade away to fade into a gray blur i suddenly remembered the drawings in the newest issue of the masked mutant a big twopage drawing had shown the long hallways of the masked mutants secret headquarters the long twisting hallway in the comic book looked just like this hallway except that the comic book hallway had bright green walls and a yellow ceiling and the rooms were filled with costumed supervillains who worked for the masked mutant as i slowly made my way through this gray empty hallway i had a weird thought everything looked so gray and washed out i had the feeling that i was in a sketch of a hallway a blackandwhite pencil drawing that hadnt been filled in yet but of course that didnt make any sense at all youre just thinking crazy thoughts because youre so scared i told myself and then i heard a noise a hard thumping sound a bump whoa i whispered my heart leaped up to my throat i stopped in the middle of the hall and listened bump thump coming from up ahead from around the next corner i forced myself to walk i turned the corner and gasped at the bright colors the walls down this hallway were bright green the ceiling was yellow the thick carpet under my sneakers was a dark winered bump bump thump the colors were so bright i had to shield my eyes with one hand i squinted to the end of the hall the green walls led to a closed yellow door the door had a metal bolt against the front thump thump the sounds were coming from behind the bolted doorway i made my way slowly down the hall to the doorway i stopped outside the bolted door anyone in there i tried to call into the room but my voice came out in a choked whisper i coughed and tried again anyone in there no reply then another loud bumping sound like wood thumping against wood anyone in there i called my voice a little stronger the thumping sounds stopped can you help me a mans voice called from inside the room i froze can you help me the man pleaded i hesitated for a second should i try to help him yes i raised both hands to the metal bolt i took a deep breath and shoved the bolt with all my strength to my surprise it slid easily the door was unlocked i turned the handle and pushed the door open i stumbled offbalance into the room and stared in amazement at the figure staring back at me you youre real i cried his cape was twisted and his mask had rolled down over one eye but i knew i was staring at the galloping gazelle youre really alive i blurted out of course he replied impatiently untie me kid he gazed toward the open door youd better hurry i realized that his powerful arms and legs were tied to the chair the thumping and bumping had been the sounds of his chair banging against the floor as he had tried to escape i i cant believe that youre here i cried i was so amazed and so frightened i didnt know what i was saying ill give you my autograph later he said his eyes still on the doorway just hurry okay weve got to get out of here i dont think we have much time ttime i stammered hell be back the galloping gazelle murmured we want to get to him before he gets to us right kid us i cried just untie me the galloping gazelle instructed i can handle him he shook his head i wish i could contact my buddies at the league theyre probably all searching the universe for me still half dazed i stumbled across the tiny room to the chair and began working at the ropes the knots were big and tight and hard to untie the coarse rope scraped my hands as i struggled to loosen them hurry kid the galloping gazelle urged hey how did you find the secret headquarters anyway i just found it i replied tugging at the knots dont be modest kid the superhero said in his flat low voice you used your secret cyberradar powers right or did you use ultramind control to read my thoughts and hurry to my rescue no i just took the bus i replied i didnt really know how to answer him did he have me confused with someone else why was i here what was going to happen to us to me questions questions they flew through my mind as i frantically worked at the heavy ropes i tried to ignore the pain from the cuts and scrapes to my hands but it hurt a lot finally one of the knots slid open the galloping gazelle flexed his muscles and stretched out his powerful chest and the ropes popped away easily thanks kid he boomed jumping to his feet he adjusted his mask so that he could see through both eyeholes then he swept his long cape behind him and straightened his tights okay lets go pay him a surprise visit he said pulling up the ends of his gloves he started toward the door taking long heavy strides his boots thundered loudly as he walked uh do you really want me to come too i asked lingering behind the chair he nodded i know what youre worried about kid youre worried that you wont be able to keep up with me because i have dynolegs and im the fastest living mutant in the known universe well i hesitated dont worry he replied ill go slow he motioned impatiently lets get moving i tripped over the tangle of ropes on the floor grabbed the chair to catch my balance then followed him out into the greenandyellow hallway he turned and began running down the hall as i started to follow he became a blueandred blur of light and then vanished a few seconds later he came jogging back sorry too fast for you he called i nodded a little he rested a gloved hand heavily on my shoulder his gray eyes peered at me solemnly through the slits in his mask do you have wallclimbing abilities he demanded i shook my head no sorry okay well take the stairs he said he grabbed my hand and pulled me down the hall he moved so fast both of my feet were in the air i guess it was impossible for him to go slow the walls whirred past in a bright green blur he pulled me around a corner then another corner i felt as if i were flying we were moving so fast i didnt have time to breathe around another corner then through an open doorway the doorway led to a flight of steep dark stairs i peered up to the top but i could see only heavy blackness i expected the galloping gazelle to pull me up the stairs but to my surprise he stopped just past the doorway he narrowed his eyes at the stairs there is a disintegratorray there he announced rubbing his square jaw thoughtfully a what i cried a disintegratorray he repeated his eyes locked on the stairs if you step into it it will disintegrate you in one hundredth of a second i swallowed hard my entire body started to tremble do you think you can jump the first two steps the galloping gazelle asked you mean i started land on the third step he instructed get a good running start ill need it i thought staring at the steep steps i suddenly wished i hadnt eaten so many poptarts and bowls of frosted flakes for breakfast every morning if only i were a little slimmer a little lighter get a good running start and make sure you clear the first two steps the galloping gazelle warned land on the third step and keep moving if you land on the first or second step youll disintegrate he motioned with his fingers poof i let out a low frightened moan i couldnt help myself i wanted to be brave but my body wasnt cooperating it was shaking and quaking as if i were made of jello ill go first the superhero said he turned to the stairs bent his knees stretched both hands forward and leaped over the invisible disintegratorray he landed on the fifth step he turned around and motioned for me to follow see its easy he said brightly easy for you i thought darkly some of us dont have dynolegs hurry he urged if you stop to think about it you wont be able to do it im already thinking about it i thought how can i not think about it i im not very athletic i murmured in a tiny trembling voice what an understatement whenever the kids i know play any sports i am always the last kid chosen for a team hurry the galloping gazelle urged he reached out both hands take a good running jump kid aim for the third step it isnt that high ill catch you the third step looked about a mile in the air to me but i held my breath bent my knees took a running leap my best leap and i landed with a hard thud on the first step i screamed and clamped my eyes shut as the disintegratorray poured through me and my body crumbled into thin air actually i didnt feel anything i opened my eyes to find myself still standing on the bottom step still in one chubby piece i i i i stammered i guess he doesnt have it turned on the galloping gazelle said calmly he smiled at me through the mask you caught a break kid i was still trembling cold beads of sweat rolled down my forehead i couldnt speak hope your luck holds out the galloping gazelle muttered he turned and started up the stairs his cape floating behind him come on lets go meet our destiny i didnt like the sound of that not one bit but i didnt like anything that was going on the galloping gazelle had said that i was lucky but i certainly didnt feel lucky as i followed him up the dark stairs at the top landing he pushed open a wide metal door and we stepped into an amazing room the room glowed with color it was decorated like an office the fanciest most luxurious office i have ever seen the shaggy white carpet was soft and so thick i sank in it nearly to my ankles silky blue curtains were draped over enormous windows that overlooked the town sparkly crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling velvety couches and chairs were arranged around dark wood tables one wall was covered with floortoceiling bookshelves each shelf filled with leathercovered books a giant tv screen dark stood in one corner beside it a wall of electronic equipment enormous oil paintings of green farm fields covered one wall a shiny goldplated desk stood in the middle of the room the tall desk chair behind it looked more like a throne than a chair wow i cried lingering near the door my eyes taking in the splendor of the vast room he treats himself nice the galloping gazelle commented but his time is over you mean i started im too fast for him the superhero boasted ill run circles around him faster and faster until i become a raging tornado hell be swept away forever wow i repeated i didnt know what else to say he caught me napping before the galloping gazelle continued thats the only way he can catch me when im asleep otherwise im much too fast for him too fast for anybody know how fast i run the onehundred how fast i asked i run it in onetenth onetenth of a second that would be an olympic record but they dont let me in the olympics because im a mutant i started to follow the galloping gazelle to the center of the room but i stopped when i heard the laughter the same cold laughter i had heard in the lobby i froze in fright and stared as the gold desk began to move and change the shiny gold shimmered as it shifted and bent raising itself up and forming a human figure i took a step back trying to hide behind the galloping gazelle as the desk melted away and the masked mutant rose up in its place his dark eyes burned menacingly through the slits in his mask he was a lot taller than he appeared in the comic and a lot more powerfullooking and a lot scarier he raised a fist at the galloping gazelle you dare to invade my private office he demanded say goodbye to all this illgotten splendor the galloping gazelle told the mutant ill say goodbye to you the masked mutant shot back spitting the words angrily then he turned his frightening cold eyes on me ill handle you easily gazelle the worlds most evil supervillain said softly but first watch me destroy the kid i shrank back as the masked mutant took a step toward me his fist still raised his black eyes glaring furiously into mine my heart pounding i turned and frantically searched for a hiding place but there was nowhere to hide and i couldnt make a run for it the door slammed shut as the masked mutant moved closer whoa i cried i raised both hands in front of my face as if shielding myself i couldnt bear to see his cold cruel eyes glaring at me as he approached hes going to destroy me i thought but i dont have to watch and then as the masked mutant took one more step the galloping gazelle moved to block his way youll deal with me mutant he declared in his booming voice if you want the kid youll have to take me out first no problem the masked mutant declared softly but his expression changed as the galloping gazelle began to circle him faster and faster until the gazelle appeared to disappear into a whirling spinning tornado of blue and red the gazelle is carrying out his plan i realized as i backed up to the wall hes going to run faster and faster around the masked mutant until he creates a whirlwind that will blow the evil mutant away pressing my back against the wall i watched the amazing battle eagerly the galloping gazelle whirled faster faster so fast a powerful wind swept over the room slapping the curtains toppling over a vase of flowers sending books flying from the shelves yes i thought happily shooting both fists into the air yes we win we win i lowered my hands and let out a horrified groan when i saw the masked mutant casually stick his foot out the galloping gazelle tripped over the foot and slammed facedown onto the floor with a shattering thud he bounced hard a couple of times and then lay still the wind stopped the curtains fell back in place the masked mutant stood over the fallen superhero hands triumphantly on the waist of his costume get up i screamed without even realizing i was doing it get up gazelle please the gazelle groaned but didnt move dinnertime sneered the masked mutant my back pressed hard against the wall i stared in horror as the mutant began to change again his face twisted and appeared to flatten his body lowered and he leaned forward spreading his hands on the floor he stepped forward as a snarling leopard tilting its head to one side the leopard uttered a ferocious growl of attack then it arched its back tensed its back legs and leaped on to the sprawled body of the galloping gazelle get up get up gazelle i shrieked as the leopard attacked the masked mutant clawed and gnawed at the helpless gazelle get up get up i screamed to my shock the galloping gazelle opened his eyes the ferocious leopard ripped away the bottom of the gazelles mask with its teeth the galloping gazelle rolled out from under the enormous beast and scrambled to his feet with a roar the leopard swiped its paws sending a long tear down the length of the gazelles cape im outta here the gazelle cried making tracks to the door he turned back to me youre on your own kid no wait i screamed i dont think the gazelle heard me he shoved open the door with one shoulder and vanished the door slammed behind him quickly the leopard changed rising up on its hind legs its body shifting and moving until the masked mutant stepped forward he smiled at me as he approached a cold menacing smile youre on your own kid he said softly i edged along the wall as the masked mutant moved slowly steadily toward me i knew i couldnt get to the door as the galloping gazelle had i wasnt fast enough he should call himself the galloping chicken i thought bitterly how could he save his own skin and leave me here like this i couldnt run i couldnt fight what could i do what could i do against a deadly foe who could turn himself into anything solid the masked mutant stopped in the center of the room hands on his waist his dark eyes twinkling he was enjoying my fright and already tasting his victory what are your powers kid he demanded a sneer in his voice huh his question caught me by surprise what are your powers he repeated impatiently swirling his cape behind him do you shrink down to a tiny bug is that your secret huh shrink me i was shaking so hard i couldnt think straight why was he asking me these questions do you burst into flames he continued moving closer is that your power are you magnetic are you a mindfogger his voice turned angry what is it kid answer me what is your power i i dont have any powers i stammered if i pressed any harder into the wall id become part of the wallpaper the masked mutant laughed so you wont tell me huh okay okay have it your way his smile faded his dark eyes turned cold and hard i was just trying to make it easy on you he said moving even closer i want to destroy you in the easiest way possible oh i see i muttered my eye caught something on the shelf a large smooth stone as big as a coconut it was some kind of decoration i wondered if it would make a good weapon say byebye kid he said through clenched teeth he came toward me quickly and as he moved i grabbed the big stone off the shelf it was a lot heavier than id thought it wasnt stone i realized it was shaped like a smooth stone but it was made of solid steel i hoisted it up and took careful aim then i heaved it at the masked mutants head and missed the stone thudded heavily onto the carpet nice try he muttered and moved quickly to destroy me i tried to duck away from him but he was too quick his powerful hands grabbed me around the waist and lifted me off the floor higher higher i realized he was moving his molecules making his arms stretch until he had lifted me above the chandelier i thrashed my arms and legs and tried to squirm away but he was too strong higher higher until my head banged hard against the ceiling at least twenty feet above the floor happy landings the masked mutant cried gleefully as he prepared to drop me and send me plummeting to my doom but before he could drop me i heard the door swing open the masked mutant heard it too holding me suspended in the air he turned to see who had entered you he cried in surprise high above the floor i squirmed around and bent my head to see through the chandelier the light sparkled through the crystals making it impossible to see how dare you burst in here the masked mutant cried to the intruder he lowered me a little just enough for me to see the doorway libby i cried what are you doing here the masked mutant lowered me to the floor and turned to face libby my legs were wobbling so badly i had to grab on to a bookshelf to hold myself up libby get out of here get away i tried to warn her but she stormed into the room her red hair flying behind her she had her eyes on me and completely ignored the masked mutant doesnt she know that he is the most evil supervillain in the known universe skipper didnt you hear me calling you libby demanded sharply huh libby i was across the street she said i saw you going into this building i called to you i i didnt hear you i stammered listen youd better get out of here libby ive been searching and searching for you she continued ignoring my warning ignoring my frantic gestures what are you doing in here skipper uh i really cant talk right now i replied pointing to the masked mutant he stood impatiently hands at his waist tapping his boot on the carpet i see that i will have to destroy you both he said quietly libby spun around she seemed to notice the supervillain for the first time skipper and i are leaving now she said with a sneer i gasped didnt she know who she was talking to no of course she didnt know she reads only high school harry beanhead comics she has no idea how much danger we are in i realized im sorry the masked mutant replied sneering back at libby from under his mask you are not leaving in fact you are never leaving this building again libby glared back at him and i saw her expression change her green eyes grew wide and her mouth dropped open she took a step back until she stood beside me we have to do something she whispered do something what could we do against the monstrous megamutant i swallowed hard i couldnt think of how to answer her the masked mutant tossed back his cape and took a step toward us which one of you wants to go first he demanded softly i turned and saw that libby had backed up to the bookshelves she pulled a yellow plastic toy gun from her backpack libby what are you doing i whispered thats just a toy i know she whispered back but this is a comic book right it cant be real so if its a comic book we can do anything she raised the plastic toy pistol and aimed it at the masked mutant he let out a cold laugh what do you plan to do with that toy he asked scornfully it only llooks like a toy libby stammered its a moleculemelter leave this room or ill melt all your molecules the mutants smile grew wider nice try he said flashing two rows of perfect white teeth he narrowed his eyes at libby and took another step toward her i guess you want to go first ill try not to hurt you too much libby held the toy gun in front of her with both hands she gritted her teeth preparing to pull the trigger put down that toy it cant help you the masked mutant declared moving closer im not kidding libby insisted in a shrill voice it isnt a toy it really is a moleculemelter the masked mutant laughed again and took another step closer then another step libby aimed the gun at the mutants chest she pulled the trigger a highpitched whistle burst out of the gun the masked mutant took another step closer then another libby lowered the plastic gun we both stared in horror as the masked mutant came nearer he took one more step then stopped a bright white light circled his body the light became a crackling electrical current the mutant uttered a low moan then he began to melt his head melted down into his mask tinier and tinier until it disappeared completely the empty mask slumped on to the shoulders of his costume and then the rest of his body melted away shrinking until there was nothing left but a wrinkled costume and cape heaped on the carpet libby and i stood staring down at the costume in silence it it worked i finally managed to choke out the toy gun it worked libby of course she replied with surprising calm she walked over to the empty costume and kicked it with her sneaker of course it worked i warned him it was a moleculemelter he wouldnt listen my brain was doing flipflops i didnt really understand it was just a toy pistol why did it destroy the mightiest mutant on earth lets get out of here i pleaded starting toward the door libby moved to block my path im sorry skipper she said softly sorry what do you mean she raised the plastic pistol and aimed it at me im sorry she said because youre disappearing next at first i thought libby was joking libby put down the gun i told her you have a sick sense of humor she kept the plastic gun aimed at my chest i let out a feeble laugh but i quickly cut it short when i saw the hard expression on her face libby whats your problem i demanded im not libby she replied softly i hate to break the news to you skipper but there is no libby as she said those words she began to change her red hair slid into her head her cheeks grew wider her nose lengthened her eyes changed from green to black she stretched up growing taller muscles bulged on her skinny arms and as she grew her clothing changed too her jeans and tshirt appeared to melt away replaced by a familiarlooking costume the costume of the masked mutant libby whats going on i cried in a tiny frightened voice i still didnt understand how are you doing that she shook her head you dont catch on very fast do you she said rolling her eyes her voice came out deep and booming a mans voice libby i she swept her cape behind her im the masked mutant skipper i changed my molecules into a girl your age and called myself libby but im the masked mutant but but but i sputtered she tossed the toy gun aside and grinned at me triumphantly but you just melted the masked mutant i cried we both saw him melt she shook her head no youre mistaken i just melted the magnificent molecule man i gaped at her in astonishment huh molecule man he worked for me she explained glancing down at the crumpled empty costume on the floor sometimes i ordered him to dress like me to keep people off my track he worked for you and you melted him i cried im a villain the masked mutant replied smiling i do very bad things remember it all started to come clear there never was a libby it had been the masked mutant all along the masked mutant stepped over the crumpled costume to move closer to me once again i pressed my back against the wall now i have no choice now i have to do something very bad to you skipper he said flatly his black eyes staring hard into mine through his mask but why i cried why cant i just leave ill go straight home ill never tell anyone about you really i pleaded he shook his head i cant let you leave you belong here now huh i gasped what are you saying libby i mean mutant you belong here now skipper he replied coldly i knew it when i saw you on the bus for the first time i knew you were perfect when you told me you knew everything about my comics but but i sputtered again its so hard to find good characters for my stories skipper its so hard to find good foes im always looking for new faces thats why i was so pleased when i discovered you his evil grin grew wider then when you recognized my headquarters building i knew you were right i knew you were ready to star in a story the smile faded quickly im so sorry skipper but the story is over your part has come to an end what what are you going to do i stammered destroy you of course the mutant replied coldly i pressed my back against the wall i stared back at him thinking hard goodbye skipper the masked mutant said softly but you cant do this i screamed youre just a character in a comic book but im real im a real live person im a real boy a strange smile formed on the mutants lips no youre not skipper he said snickering youre not real youre just like me now youre a comic book character too i pinched my arm it felt as warm and real as always youre a liar i shouted the masked mutant nodded a pleased smile formed on his face yes im a liar he agreed thats one of my better qualities his smile faded but im not lying this time skipper youre not real anymore i refused to believe him i feel the way i always have i declared but i changed you into a comic book character he insisted remember when you entered this building for the first time remember when you walked through the glass door and a beam of light passed over you i nodded yes i remember that i muttered well that was a scanner the masked mutant continued when you stepped through it it scanned your body it turned you into tiny dots of ink no i shouted he ignored my cry thats all you are now skipper tiny dots of red blue and yellow ink youre a comic book character just like me he slid toward me menacingly his cape spreading out behind him but im sorry to say youve made your last appearance in my comic book or in any comic book wait i cried i cant wait any longer the masked mutant replied coldly ive already wasted too much time on you skipper but im not skipper i declared im not skipper matthews i said there is no skipper matthews oh really he asked rolling his eyes then who are you im the colossal elastic boy i replied the masked mutant uttered a low gasp elastic boy he exclaimed i thought you looked familiar goodbye mutant i said in a deep voice where are you going he asked sharply back to my home planet of xargos i replied starting toward the door im not allowed to gueststar in other comic books he moved quickly to block the door nice try elastic boy he said but you have invaded my secret headquarters i have to destroy you i laughed you cant destroy elastic boy i boasted ill stretch out my elastic arms and wrap you in them and squeeze you into playdoh i dont think so the masked mutant replied dryly he let out an angry growl im tired of all this talk talk talk im going to tear you to pieces and then tear your pieces into tiny pieces i laughed again no way i told him im elastic remember i cant be torn into pieces i bend but i dont break theres only one way that elastic boy can be destroyed whats that the masked mutant asked by sulphuric acid i replied thats the only thing that can destroy my elastic body a pleased smile spread behind the masked face oops i cried i didnt mean to let that slip out i tried to make it to the door but i wasnt fast enough i saw the masked mutant quickly begin to change he changed into a steaming hot wave of sulphuric acid and before i could move the tall wave of acid swept toward me with a loud cry i leaped away the tall wave swept past it missed me by inches i turned and watched it splash over the carpet the carpet began to sizzle and burn yes i shouted gleefully yes i had never felt so happy so strong so triumphant i had defeated the masked mutant i had totally tricked him i had destroyed the most evil supervillain ever to walk the planet me a twelveyearold boy named skipper matthews i had sent the masked mutant to his doom such a simple trick but it had worked from reading the comics i knew that the masked mutant could change his molecules into anything solid and then change back again but i tricked him into changing himself into a liquid and once he changed into a liquid he could not reform himself the masked mutant was gone forever skipper you are a clever guy i shouted out loud i was so happy i did a little dance on the thick carpet i couldnt believe the masked mutant had believed that i was elastic boy id made that name up ive never heard of any elastic boy but he fell for it and now the evil supervillain is gone i thought happily and i am alive alive i couldnt wait to get home and see my family again the bus ride seemed to take hours finally i was running up my front lawn into the house through the front door i immediately saw a brown envelope lying on the mail table the new issue of the masked mutant who needs it i asked myself i ignored it and hurried to say hi to my parents i was so glad to be home i was even happy to see mitzi mitzi how about a game of frisbee i asked huh she gaped at me in shock i never want to play anything with my little sister but today i just wanted to be happy and celebrate being alive mitzi and i hurried out to the back yard we threw a frisbee around for about half an hour we had a great time how about a snack i asked her yeah im starving she replied mom left some chocolate cake on the counter chocolate cake sounded just right humming happily to myself i trotted into the kitchen i pulled down two plates from the cabinet then i found the big cake knife in the drawer dont make your slice bigger than mine mitzi warned watching me carefully as i prepared to cut the cake mitzi i promise i wont cheat you i said sweetly i was in such a good mood even mitzi couldnt get me upset this looks like awesome chocolate cake i exclaimed i slid the big knife over the cake it slipped ow i cried out as the knife blade cut the back of my hand i raised my hand and stared down at the cut hey i uttered in surprise what was trickling out from the cut not blood it was red blue yellow and black ink cool mitzi cried wheres that new masked mutant comic i asked i suddenly had the feeling that my comic book career wasnt over
