chapter one holiday in london it is hot in cairo in august very hot the people who live in cairo go away in august if they can some go to alexandria where it is much cooler and some of the lucky ones go abroad to europe or america salahadin el nur chief inspector in the egyptian police was one of the lucky ones he was able to go on holiday because no archeologists come to egypt in august when it is so hot archeologists prefer to come to egypt in the cooler months of winter it is hot in cairo in august but it is much hotter in the south of egypt in the desert around luxor the sun can burn a mans body like a bar of redhot iron and it is there that most of the archeologists want to work many of the ancient temples and cities of egypt are in and around the modern town of luxor thursday th august was salahadins last day at work he was going on holiday for three weeks his assistant inspector leila osman would be in charge while salahadin was away at half past eleven salahadin tidied up his papers and locked the drawers of his desk then he stood up and went over to where leila was sitting he gave her the keys leila like salahadin was a graduate of cairo university they had both studied ancient history leila was twentyseven six years younger than salahadin she had joined his department five years ago and was now one of the youngest inspectors in the egyptian police im off to london on saturday salahadin told leila im staying there for three weeks and ill be back again on saturday th and ill have a holiday here in the office replied leila therell be nothing for me to do ill read the newspapers and count the days until you get back dont forget to send me a postcard from piccadilly why piccadilly asked salahadin people say that piccadilly is the centre of the criminal world was leilas reply salahadin laughed and hurried out of the office he wanted to get a taxi before the lunchtime rush hour in cairo began on saturday salahadin arrived at cairo international airport early in the morning it was already warm and everyone was getting ready for another day of burning heat but the passengers were looking forward to going to europe where it would be much cooler the customs and immigration officials knew salahadin and he quickly passed through into the departure lounge soon he was in the plane and on his way to london in london everything was very different it was wet and cold salahadin arrived at his hotel in gower street just after three oclock in the afternoon it was a small hotel but it was just round the corner from the british museum salahadin was going to spend part of his holiday working in the museum with a friend dr peter earl the british museum has one of the largest collections of egyptian antiquities in the world on saturday evening it was still raining a little but it was warmer salahadin went for a walk through the streets of central london he walked down tottenham court road to leicester square and then along to piccadilly when he was in piccadilly he remembered leilas postcard ill buy it now while i remember thought salahadin he walked into a tourist shop selling postcards and books salahadin walked past the bookshelves to find a postcard he found one which was a photograph of piccadilly by night he walked back to the counter to pay for it on his way back he had a quick look at the books on the shelves he noticed a book which interested him the title of the book was the mystery of queen axtarte and the name of the author was dr john farrow salahadin knew that queen axtarte was a queen in ancient egypt and salahadin had read many books on ancient egypt written by famous archeologists but he had never heard of an archeologist called dr farrow salahadin decided to buy the book and read it later he paid for the postcard and the book and walked out into the busy streets of piccadilly it was now raining heavily salahadin walked towards leicester square he noticed that a new film was being shown in one of the cinemas salahadin decided that was the best way to spend a wet evening in london he had a meal in a small restaurant and went into the cinema it was very late when salahadin got back to his hotel he went to bed and soon fell asleep the mystery of queen axtarte lay on the table beside his bed it was still wrapped up in the paper from the bookshop chapter two who is dr farrow when salahadin was having breakfast the next morning he was called to the telephone it was his friend dr earl welcome back to london said dr earl my wife and i want to know if youd like to lunch with us today yes id like that thanks very much ill get a train from waterloo and ill be at your house by twelve peter earl lived in richmond a suburb of london salahadin knew it well he had been there many times before after breakfast salahadin had some time to wait before starting out on his journey to richmond he remembered the book he had bought the night before he unwrapped it and read what was written on the back cover salahadin started to read the book but soon it was time to leave for his train to richmond the mystery of queen axtarte dr john farrow dr farrows research provides new answers to some of the many questions about queen axtarte these questions have puzzled archeologists for many years who was queen axtarte what was the curse of queen axtarte why was she called the queen of death dr farrow also gives his answer to the most important question where was queen axtarte buried in dr peter earls sittingroom salahadin looked out across the street to the richmond park he watched an old man with his dog an englishman and his dog said salahadin ive never been able to understand the english and their love of dogs and you egyptians my friend replied peter earl what about your cats your ancestors the ancient egyptians loved cats didnt they they both laughed talking of ancient egyptians reminds me of something said salahadin i found a new book in a bookshop in piccadilly last night its written by a man called farrow dr john farrow have you heard of him dr john farrow now that is strange i was going to ask you about him have you read this mornings papers peter earl handed salahadin a copy of the sunday times theres a report on page three that puzzles me went on peter earl salahadin opened the paper at page three and found the report near the bottom of the page the tomb of the queen of death dr john farrow the young archeologist who claims to have discovered the secret burial place of queen axtarte flew with his wife to cairo last thursday dr farrow has studied the writing on an ancient stone pillar kept in the british museum the pillar was brought to britain many years ago it was found in the ancient temple of karnak which is a few kilometres north of luxor in upper egypt dr farrow believes that the writing was made by someone who was at queen axtartes burial that person lived for only a few hours after the burial but lived long enough to write down where she was buried dr farrow is going to luxor to find the tomb and to prove that his claims are correct this pillar from the temple of karnak salahadin began is there really such a pillar in the museum yes there is and its got some marks on it which might be writing but no one is certain it seems that dr john farrow is certain said salahadin who is dr farrow why havent i heard his name before peter earl told salahadin what he knew about dr farrow farrow is about twentyeight years old he was a brilliant student at cambridge one of the best there has ever been but after he got his doctorate he changed completely he left cambridge about three years ago and went to live with some friends in wales he didnt write any letters he didnt tell anyone about his visits to the british museum and his interest in the pillar from karnak he has written this book and now he has gone off to cairo and his wife has gone with him said salahadin i didnt even know that he was married said peter earl and hes never been to egypt before went on salahadin he doesnt know how hot it is its too hot to search for a tomb near luxor at this time of the year yes hes not going to find it easy who else knows about the writing on this pillar asked salahadin the man who knows most about it is your friend professor gomouchian and hes in cairo perhaps i ought to be in cairo too said salahadin slowly and thoughtfully many people would like to know where the tomb of queen axtarte is and im not speaking about scholars and archeologists im thinking of smugglers like the amsterdam ring yes you could be right peter earl agreed the amsterdam ring would like to know where the queen of death is buried the treasure in her tomb will be worth millions of pounds and here is a report in the sunday times where everyone can read about it said salahadin the two men sat silently for a few moments ill be late coming to the museum tomorrow said salahadin ill have to go to our embassy and get in touch with my assistant leila osman chapter three salahadin is suspicious early next morning salahadin was at the doors of the egyptian embassy in london it was not long before he had sent off a telex to the ministry of the interior in cairo and another telex to his assistant leila osman the first telex was to his friend chief inspector ahmed abbas salahadin had worked with inspector ahmed before the telex said attention inspector ahmed abbas ministry of interiorcairo dr john farrow and wife reported arriving in cairo last thursday please confirm arrival and inform me name of their hotel salahadin el nur egyptian embassylondon the second telex to leila osman said attention inspector leila osman antiquities protection departmentcairo dr john farrow archeologist reported arriving in cairo last thursday please inform me of his plans and movements salahadin el nur egyptian embassylondon then salahadin went to the visa section of the embassy and looked at the visa applications he soon found farrows application salahadin noticed a number of unusual things about the application now this is interesting thought salahadin he has left out his doctorate and he says hes a school teacher very strange and why does he say hes going to egypt as a tourist salahadin realized that leila would know nothing about dr farrow farrow had not written on his visa application that he was an archeologist his arrival in cairo would not be reported to salahadins office the replies to his telex messages came in shortly after each other leilas telex confirmed what salahadin had already guessed good thought salahadin she has got in touch immediately with inspector ahmed attention salahadin el nur egyptian embassylondon no one called dr john farrow has reported to this office nothing known of his movements or plans have reported matter to inspector ahmed leila osman the telex from inspector ahmed confirmed salahadins suspicions attention salahadin el nur egyptian embassylondon confirm arrival of mr john farrow and his wife as tourists in egypt farrows occupation given on immigration form as school teacher farrow and wife stayed one night thursday th august hotel mirabel left friday warning no knowledge of where they are now trying to find them please explain your interest in farrow ahmed abbas it was two oclock when salahadin received the telex messages it was too late to get a plane for cairo that day also salahadin had some things to do in london he wanted to find out as much as he could about dr john farrow from peter earl and he wanted to know if interpol the international police had anything about the man on their files first salahadin booked a flight to cairo for the following day then he sent off two further telex messages attention inspector leila osman antiquities protection departmentcairo returning cairo immediately urgent you meet me at cairo airport tomorrow tuesday th flight mea from london arriving cairo salahadin el nur second message attention inspector ahmed abbas ministry of interiorcairo arriving cairo tomorrow tuesday th flight mea from london arriving cairo urgent you meet me urgent repeat urgent you find farrow and wife will explain when we meet salahadin el nur salahadin thanked the officials in the embassy and hurried out to get a taxi to the british museum as he sat in the taxi salahadin asked himself over and over again why had farrow tried to deceive the egyption officials by saying that he was a teacher and not an archeologist and why had he said that he was in egypt as a tourist farrow had written all these things in his visa application four weeks ago but then he had told someone that he was going to egypt to find the tomb of queen axtarte he had told someone about this because it had been reported in the sunday times peter earl had also been busy that morning he had phoned up everyone who knew dr farrow everybody said that farrow had left cambridge and gone to live with some friends in wales but nobody seemed to know anything more someone had heard that farrow was using drugs another had heard that farrow had been in trouble with the police but no one knew anything for certain finally peter earl phoned up the sunday times and spoke to the reporter who had written about farrow going to cairo when salahadin arrived at the british museum peter told him about the calls he had made to farrows friends im interested in the remark about drugs said salahadin the people who sell drugs in england often smuggle them from the middle east and the people who smuggle drugs sometimes smuggle antiquities perhaps farrow is involved with a gang of smugglers youd better ask scotland yard and interpol suggested peter earl they may know something more about farrow thats what im going to do now said salahadin but first a question which you can answer do you believe that farrow has discovered the burial place of queen axtarte farrow was a brilliant student at cambridge he claims that he has discovered the queens burial place it is possible that he is telling the truth and other people might agree with you said salahadin if farrow is involved with a gang of smugglers he might have told them how to find queen axtartes tomb im sure they would be interested in the treasure but why did farrow phone up the sunday times peter earl asked so thats how the report got in the newspaper said salahadin yes farrow phoned up the paper and told them about his visit to cairo if farrow is working with a gang why would he do that perhaps he is calling for help replied salahadin the smugglers may be making farrow work with them perhaps farrow doesnt want to help them to find the tomb salahadin promised to write to peter and let him know what had happened then the two men said goodbye and salahadin went to scotland yard salahadin had arranged to meet chief inspector beaston of scotland yard the chief inspector showed salahadin a file with a short report on dr john farrow farrow had been fined two years earlier for having a small quantity of cannabis but he never told us where he got the cannabis chief inspector beaston told salahadin if he had told us where he got the drugs he would not have been fined what about interpol asked salahadin do they know anything about farrow nothing at all replied chief inspector beaston as far as we know this visit to egypt is the first time he has ever left england its strange that no one knows very much about dr farrow said salahadin it was late when salahadin got to bed but he read a little of farrows book before he fell asleep and the next day on the plane he went on reading the book with interest i must go and see professor gomouchian early tomorrow morning he thought to himself as the plane took him across the mediterranean towards egypt chapter four the black mercedes inspector ahmed and leila were waiting for salahadin when his plane landed at cairo international airport they had a police car and a driver with them the driver set out immediately for the ministry of the interior in the centre of cairo have you any news of dr farrow and his wife was salahadins first question we have checked every hotel in cairo replied inspector ahmed we cannot find them at all what about luxor asked salahadin have you tried to find them in luxor why luxor asked ahmed salahadin told ahmed and leila what he had learnt in london and he told them about dr farrows book the mystery of queen axtarte in his book salahadin explained farrow claims that the tomb of queen axtarte is near luxor on the east bank of the nile but all the tombs of the pharoahs and the queens of egypt are on the west bank of the nile interrupted leila farrow explains that in his book replied salahadin queen axtarte knew that all the tombs were on the west bank she was a very clever woman and thats why she had her tomb made on the east bank of the nile and you think that farrow has come here to egypt to look for this tomb inspector ahmed asked salahadin im sure thats what he is doing replied salahadin and hes not alone yes his wife is with him agreed leila i dont mean his wife said salahadin i think there is a gang of smugglers with him the car stopped at a big roundabout in heliopolis a modern suburb of cairo a large black mercedes drew up beside them why do you think theres a gang with him asked ahmed ill answer that question in a few moments replied salahadin first i want to buy some cigarettes what do you want cigarettes for asked leila you dont smoke salahadin did not answer leilas question instead he spoke to the driver do you know that cigarette kiosk about two hundred metres on the right the driver nodded his head to show that he understood stop in front of the kiosk salahadin told the driver the car slowed down moved over to the right and stopped by the pavement salahadin got out of the car and walked slowly over to the kiosk he bought a packet of cigarettes and walked back to the car dont start yet salahadin told the driver he turned and spoke to ahmed and leila do you see that black mercedes parked beside the pavement about twenty metres in front of us they both looked at it carefully its got a foreign number plate said inspector ahmed thats the one said salahadin now watch what happens the police car drove away from the side of the road when they had driven past the mercedes the mercedes moved away from the pavement and followed them i noticed it earlier salahadin told the others i thought that car was following us now i am sure they were approaching a busy road junction in the centre of heliopolis there were traffic lights ahead of them and a tram was coming up to the junction from the right the lights in front of them were changing from green to red drive as fast as you can salahadin told the driver get across before that tram comes the driver put his foot on the accelerator and drove across the tramlines the mercedes tried to follow behind them the tram driver rang his warning bell loudly the tram brakes squealed as the tram tried to stop but it was too late the tram hit the back of the mercedes and the car ran onto the grass it stopped in the middle of the junction stop quick shouted salahadin the police driver stopped as quickly as he could salahadin ahmed and leila jumped out of the car and ran back but they were too late two men who had been in the car had jumped out they had disappeared through the crowd of people who were running towards the accident too late said ahmed theyve escaped lets have a look inside the mercedes said salahadin inspector ahmed went up to a traffic policeman and showed him his identity card go and phone the police at the ministry of the interior inspector ahmed told the traffic policeman heres the telephone number tell them that chief inspector ahmed abbas is here ahmed and leila kept the crowd away from the mercedes while salahadin searched through it salahadin sat in the drivers seat of the mercedes and looked around inside he picked up a packet of cigars and a book which was lying on the back seat of the car then he looked in the boot which had sprung open in the crash with the tram he found nothing else two policemen arrived ahmed told them to keep the crowd away from the mercedes and to wait for the police from the ministry of the interior theyll tow the car away with them he explained to the policemen they walked back again to their own car what did you find leila and ahmed asked together a packet of cigars replied salahadin dutch cigars so it is the amsterdam ring remarked leila perhaps replied salahadin but whoever they are theyre involved with farrow look salahadin held up the hook he had found in the mercedes it was the mystery of queen axtarte by dr john farrow chapter five professor gomouchian next morning salahadin phoned professor gomouchian and arranged to see him he took a taxi to zamalek where professor gomouchian lived professor gomouchian lived on the top floor of a high block of flats salahadin got out of the lift on the top floor and rang the bell of the flat door the door was opened by the professors housekeeper the housekeeper knew salahadin and showed him into the sittingroom it was an unusual room full of antiquities stone pots vases and hundreds of small statues the blinds were drawn and it was rather dark in the room salahadin looked slowly round hello said a voice it was professor gomouchian professor gomouchian was an old man about eighty years old he had a large head which was covered with long white hair he was sitting in a wheelchair and his legs were covered with a rug its been a long time since i last saw you said the professor wheeling his chair up to salahadin the two men shook hands and salahadin looked round the room once again you have your own museum here said salahadin its always a pleasure to come and visit you and look at your collection of antiquities you dont come here for pleasure the professor replied when you come here you want to find out something what is it this time have you heard of dr john farrow asked salahadin ive got his book here on my shelves replied the professor pointing to the bookshelves behind him and have you read his ideas about queen axtarte and about where she was buried yes i have replied professor gomouchian and i think he may be right im beginning to believe that he is right too said salahadin we know that queen axtarte was afraid of tomb robbers continued the professor it is possible that she had her tomb made on the east bank of the nile because all the other tombs were on the west bank but what about all the slaves who dug her tomb asked salahadin and all the nobles who attended her funeral why did none of them ever tell the secret of her tomb the slaves were easy to deal with replied professor gomouchian the queen had them all killed and the nobles it was the custom to have a feast after a funeral in ancient egypt the great feast after the funeral of queen axtarte was held in the temple of karnak we know that before her death the queen ordered all the food to be poisoned everyone who attended her funeral had to attend the feast and eat the food and they all died a terrible death and that explains the writing on the stone pillar from the temple of kamak added salahadin that is a possible explanation agreed the professor one of the mourners managed to write a message on a stone pillar before he died and the curse of queen axtarte what do you think about that asked salahadin do you think she was trying to frighten away any tomb robbers or do you think she had another plan professor gomouchian wheeled his chair up to the bookshelves and took down a copy of farrows book he opened the book and read out the words which are known as the curse of queen axtarte i am queen axtarte queen of queens i shall live forever these are my words anyone who enters my tomb anyone who steals from my tomb anyone who touches my body that person will die that person will die a terrible death and many more shall die with him if you found the queens tomb would you go into it and touch anything salahadin asked the professor no i would not was the immediate reply i would want to have a lot of scientific tests done before i did anything at the tomb of queen axtarte but why the professor took down another book from his bookshelves it was called poisons and diseases in ancient egypt the ancient egyptians knew much more about the world than we think he told salahadin they knew something about disease and about poisons there were many great plagues in ancient egypt it is possible that queen axtarte had the germs of a terrible disease put in her tomb so if anyone found the tomb they might be in great danger if anyone found the tomb and went inside they would be in great danger replied professor gomouchian i must go to luxor immediately said salahadin can you show me where the tomb might be the professor wheeled his chair to where a large map of ancient egypt was hanging on the wall he took up a stick and pointed to a place thirty kilometres northeast of karnak thats where farrow says it is he said and i agree with him while salahadin was talking to professor gomouchian leila and ahmed were at the hotel mirabel they asked to speak to the manager who was not pleased to see them weve had enough trouble from the police already because of mr farrow the manager said theres nothing more we can do to help you yes there is leila said politely we want to see the room that mr and mrs farrow stayed in the manager checked the hotel register room the manager told them its on the fifth floor and its empty you can look there if you want room was a small room it had one window which looked out onto the roof of a block of flats there was a double bed a wardrobe and a small chest of drawers in the room there was a small bathroom at one side leila searched the bed the mattress and the pillows then she looked inside the wardrobe and the chest of drawers ahmed searched the floor the walls and the lightshades then he looked carefully through the bathroom they found nothing theres nothing here said ahmed lets get out of this room leila had a last look round but she found nothing as she was walking to the door she stopped at the window and looked out the roof of a block of flats was quite near the window and slightly below it the roof was covered with all kinds of rubbish i think weve found something said leila leila had seen a book lying among the rubbish it was just under the window of room and from the hotel bedroom window leila could read the title of the book it was the mystery of queen axtarte chapter six a call for help forty minutes later leila and ahmed were back in salahadins office near tahrir square salahadin had arrived a few minutes before them and was speaking on the telephone he was arranging for a police plane to take him up to luxor he had a large map on the desk in front of him it was a map of luxor and the desert around luxor to the north and to the east salahadin had marked a large x on the map about thirty kilometres northeast of karnak ok one oclock at cairo airport said salahadin on the telephone yes ill be there tell the pilot to be ready to take off at one oclock salahadin put the telephone down and leila placed farrows book on top of the map in front of him weve found a message from farrow she said its on page ten salahadin opened the book and turned the pages farrows message on page ten had been written quickly help my name is farrow im a prisoner of a gang of smugglers they want me to take them to the tomb of queen axtarte my wife held in cairo by man called greer gang afraid of policeman called salahadin pass this mesage to policeman salahadin queens tomb kilometres northeast of karnak between snakes head and sitting man dont open tomb great danger so i was right the news report in the sunday times was a message and it is the amsterdam ring jan greer is a wellknown criminal he is wanted by interpol for smuggling and murder salahadin stood up he walked over to a wall which was covered with a large map of cairo im flying up to luxor at one oclock he said leila you and ahmed will have to find farrows wife cairos a big city said leila it wont be easy to find her salahadin pointed at the map of cairo christine farrow is being held by the amsterdam ring theyre all europeans and shes english he explained they are foreigners here in egypt if they are holding the woman in an arab part of the city someone would notice them they must be in a european part of cairo somewhere where lots of foreigners live salahadin placed his finger on the large part of cairo called heliopolis lots of europeans live here he said they could be in a house or a flat in heliopolis salahadin moved his hand to the centre of cairo he pointed to zamalek where professor gomouchian lived or they could be somewhere here the men who own the small shops in the streets they will remember if they have seen any strangers said ahmed ill send my policemen to the european parts of cairo theyll ask the shopkeepers if they have noticed any strangers in the last week and ill go to the small markets in heliopolis said leila ill speak to the servants who go shopping there one of them may have noticed something unusual ahmed went back to salahadins desk and picked up farrows book what does farrow mean by great danger he asked salahadin told them about his visit to professor gomouchian the explanation is here in farrows book he replied and professor gomouchian agrees that farrow may be right it is possible that queen axtarte had the germs of a terrible disease put into her tomb anyone who goes inside the tomb will die so if the amsterdam gang take anything out of the tomb they could spread the disease everywhere said leila thats right replied salahadin its part of the queens curse the person who enters my tomb will die a terrible death and many more shall die with him chapter seven in the desert the desert to the east of the river nile and north of karnak is rocky and mountainous there are many hills and mountains and deep valleys there was a lorry in one of these valleys about twenty kilometres northeast of karnak the lorry was parked beside a large rock there were three men in the shade of the rock they were keeping out of the heat of the midday sun youve been telling us lies farrow one man said he was tall with a red beard you know where the tomb is but youre pretending not to know farrow looked at the dutchman i dont know where it is keesing said farrow in my book i say that the queens tomb is somewhere near here but i dont know where it is exactly de fries the other dutchman was a small man wearing dark glasses he spoke quietly to keesing farrows telling lies he said weve been here in this desert for three days and we have not found the tomb but im sure farrow knows where the tomb is we are wasting time farrow said keesing if we dont get to the tomb this evening i wont call greer on the radio greer has his orders youll never see your wife again farrow knew what the orders were keesing had a powerful radio transmitter in the back of the lorry he spoke to greer every evening before seven oclock if greer did not get a call by seven oclock he had orders to get rid of christine farrow keesing turned and walked to the lorry after a few moments de fries spoke to farrow greer is a cruel and heartless man said de fries if he does not get a radio call by seven he will kill your wife dont be a fool take us to the tomb now ive told you a hundred times shouted farrow i dont know where the tomb is its after midday now said de fries you have until seven oclock you know what will happen then keesing will not call greer on the radio and greer is a cruel mana very cruel man farrow sat in silence he thought of his wife christine she was young and beautiful farrow remembered how happy they had been it seemed a long time ago they had met keesing and de fries in wales that had been the end of their happiness all right ill take you there farrow said the tomb is about ten kilometres away but it wont be easy to get there well have to hurry and when we find the tomb im going to leave you i dont want to be near that tomb when its opened keesing and de fries did not say anything they climbed up into the cab of the lorry and waited for farrow remember farrow youve got until seven oclock said keesing if we dont find this tomb by then your wife will die de fries started the engine of the lorry and waited for farrow to tell him where to go drive along this valley said farrow at the end of the valley we must turn left and travel north and we must get up onto higher ground i want to see where we are de fries drove carefully and slowly over the rough ground there were large stones everywhere the heat of the sun was like a burning fire this heats terrible said keesing cant you go any faster if i go any faster well hit a rock replied de fries then well be stuck here for hours they drove on when the lorry reached the end of the valley de fries stopped he turned to farrow where do we go now he asked farrow climbed down from the cab and took out his compass he looked at the compass and he looked at the hills around him then he climbed back into the lorry turn to the left here farrow said to de fries and try to get up that slope in front of us well be able to see around us from the top of the slope the lorry started to climb the steep slope to their left stop you fool keesing shouted at de fries luxor airport is not far from here weve seen four planes in the last three days weve seen them but we dont want them to see us de fries stopped the lorry if we dont go up higher i wont be able to see where we are said farrow the men sat in the cab in silence keesing turned to farrow get out and climb up he said the lorry stays down here farrow started to climb the slope de fries turned to keesing arent we going up with him he asked he wont run away was keesings reply hes got no water he knows he will die in the desert without water and he knows that his wife will die too farrow felt dizzy in the heat of the sun he found shade behind a large rock ive got to make them drive the lorry up onto the hill he thought to himself someone may see us from the air and report us to the police thats my only hope which way do we take now de fries asked farrow when he got back theres no way round this hill replied farrow we have to drive up here and over the top of the hill we should have gone up there with him de fries said to keesing we dont know if hes telling the truth if theres no way down the other side replied de fries well turn round and head back to luxor i dont think he is lying said keesing he knows what will happen to his wife well go up and over the top of the hill chapter eight dr jusef strengel while de fries was driving slowly up the slope in the desert salahadin was flying south towards luxor he was sitting beside the pilot in a police plane he could see the river nile below him were getting near luxor now said the pilot ill turn east then ill turn south and fly over the desert towards luxor airport a few minutes later they were flying over the desert salahadin looked through the binoculars he could see the rocks valleys and mountains below them its like a mirror he said to the pilot the sun is shining back from the sand and rocks youll see more clearly when we get down lower the pilot told him salahadin studied the map in front of him for a few moments then he looked again through the binoculars at the ground below them were nearly there he said i think the tomb is somewhere down there the plane flew lower suddenly salahadin gave the binoculars to the pilot what can you see down there he asked the pilot took the binoculars and looked down at the desert its a lorry he said to salahadin its moving over a high hill it must be them said salahadin taking back the binoculars and looking down at the lorry shall i circle round and go lower the pilot asked no we dont want to make them suspicious keep flying towards luxor airport the plane flew on and salahadin studied the ground below them through the binoculars look he said after a few moments theres another lorry down there and its bigger than the first lorry is it travelling with the first lorry asked the pilot i dont know replied salahadin slowly its about three kilometres south of the first lorry but its travelling in the same direction thats interesting said the pilot if people are together in the desert they keep close to one another but who could be in this other lorry said salahadin to himself salahadin carefully marked the positions of both lorries on the map the pilot got ready to land at luxor airport police inspector musa angheli was waiting for salahadin at luxor airport the inspector had met salahadin many times salahadin had often come to visit the ancient

found out who owns it the mercedes belongs to dr strengel we know a lot about dr strengel salahadin went on his father was german and his mother was lebanese he smuggles antiquities but hes different from the other smugglers people like the amsterdam ring smuggle antiquities and sell them to make money strengel has lots of money of his own he has one of the largest private collections of egyptian antiquities in the world hes not interested in making money he wants the antiquities for his own collection and he wants the treasures of queen axtarte for his collection added inspector musa thats right replied salahadin and im sure that hes out there in the desert in one of those lorries i think that the amsterdam ring is in the first lorry with farrow farrow is taking them to the tomb and strengel is following them salahadin discussed the situation with inspector musa there were now two gangs of smugglers out in the desert salahadin and musa could not fight them by themselves they

map he pointed to the place he had marked how long will it take us to get there he asked the driver its very rocky ground out there replied the driver if were lucky we may get there in three or four hours drive as quickly as you can said salahadin the driver started the engine and the range rover set out into the desert chapter nine the house in heliopolis back in cairo ahmed and leila were searching for christine farrow policemen were questioning all the shopkeepers especially those who sold cigatettes or food in small street shops leila had policewomen working for her they were visiting the small markets in the parts of cairo where europeans lived the servants who work for the europeans often shop in these markets in the afternoon in a small market in heliopolis a new servant began to do her shopping no one had seen her there before but servants are always friendly and they smiled at the new servant and spoke to her be careful of ismael he charges too much money for vegetables one woman said count your change carefully at abdul rahmans the butchers said another some women were sitting talking in the shade of a large tree leila the new servant sat down beside them and listened to their talk most of the conversation was about prices and wages leila sat and listened she knew that she must not ask the women questions if she asked them about their work they would become suspicious and tell her nothing after a few minutes a young woman sat down beside them one of the women said how are you today fatima and hows the sick european woman i think shes still there replied fatima she hasnt been out of the bedroom once what a wonderful life she has her husband does all the work in the house all the women laughed is she very beautiful someone asked ive told

shopping and clean the kitchen thats all and youre well paid for it too said another woman everybody laughed loudly fatima picked up her shopping basket i must go back now hell be waiting for me there was more laughter and fatima walked way leila stood up and said goodbye to the women she followed fatima for about ten minutes fatima stopped in front of an old house and knocked at the door a mans face appeared at an upstairs window fatima stood waiting at the door someone is being very careful leila thought to herself a few minutes later the door opened and fatima went inside the door closed immediately leila hurried to a small shop at the end of the street and asked to use the telephone half an hour later chief inspector ahmed arrived with two policemen they stopped the car where leila was waiting for them leila told ahmed about the servant in the market then she showed ahmed the house fatima the servant says theres a sick european woman in the bedroom leila explained to ahmed fatima has never seen the woman and the bedroom door is always locked perhaps this is the house we are looking for but we must make certain said ahmed cautiously it may not be christine farrow perhaps it is a sick woman we must make certain said leila i must get inside the house and find out who she is but how are you going to get inside asked ahmed lets wait until fatima comes out perhaps she will help us they sat in the car waiting just after five oclock fatima came out of the house again she had a basket in one hand and a bunch of keys in the other leila and ahmed got out of the car leila stopped fatima and spoke to her she showed fatima her police identity card we want to ask you about the man you work for said leila hes a foreigner replied fatima and what about the woman in the bedroom asked leila ive never seen her replied fatima the bedroom door is always locked but if you havent seen her how do you know its a woman in the bedroom said ahmed ive heard her crying and i know the sound of a woman crying how long has she been in the bedroom leila asked about five days replied fatima since last friday leila and ahmed looked at one another where are you going now leila asked fatima fatima told them that she was going to buy bread because of the heat in cairo bread does not stay fresh in the morning people buy bread for breakfast and lunch then they buy more fresh bread in the evening are those the keys of the house asked leila the foreigner locks himself in his bedroom every evening between six and seven fatima explained its the only time he gives me the keys to the

asked fatima whats happening asked fatima who are you i dont want to get into any trouble we are police officers she explained again you wont get into trouble if you help us what do you want me to do asked fatima we dont want you to do anything replied leila we want to find out more about the people you work for let me take the bread back into the house fatima was not happy about this suggestion but finally she agreed im worried about this said ahmed when leila was ready to go into the house it could be very dangerous its the easiest way of getting into the house said leila and we must make sure that it is christine farrow who is locked in that bedroom what will you do if it is her ahmed asked thats easy replied leila ill open the front door and let you in make sure you are waiting near the door with the two policemen leila turned to fatima now tell me again she said where is his bedroom and where is the bedroom with the woman in it fatima explained once again and leila listened carefully good she said ill remember that easily leila walked up to the front door with the keys in her hand chapter ten the valley of death it was just after five oclock when farrow told de fries to stop the lorry they were at the entrance to a narrow valley were here now said farrow the queens tomb is in this valley how do you know keesing asked farrow pointed up at the mountain top to the east that looks like a snake doesnt it he asked keesing and de fries looked up the top of the mountain was about three hundred metres long it ended with a great rock rising high in the sky the mountain top looked like a snake with its head raised and thats a sitting man farrow continued pointing to the mountain top to the west keesing and de fries looked upwards towards the setting sun in the middle of the mountain top there was a large rock it looked like a mans head below the rock a gully ran down the mountain side to the bottom of the valley the mountain had the shape of a sitting man a snake with raised head and a sitting man guard the tomb of queen axtarte said farrow those words are written on the pillar from the temple of karnak and wheres the tomb said keesing turning to farrow farrow pointed to the gully that ran up the mountainside somewhere between the legs of the sitting man he told keesing thats all i know youll have to go and look for it they climbed back into the lorry and de fries drove down the valley to the bottom of the gully you know that it can take a long time to get inside a tomb said farrow why is that asked keesing the ancient egyptians always made secret entrances to the tombs replied farrow and they sealed the entrance with huge rocks they wanted to keep out tomb robbers it could take you years to get inside weve got a box of dynamite in the back of the lorry keesing told farrow when we find the entrance it wont take us long to blast our way in what about the queens curse arent you afraid of that asked farrow that was written a long time ago replied keesing the queen wanted to frighten tomb robbers it doesnt mean anything today you could be wrong you know said farrow im going to get as far away from you as i can dont you want to make sure that i radio to greer asked keesing farrow did not know what to do if keesing did not radio greer would kill cristine so farrow had to stay near farrow looked up the gully there was a large rock on the right leg of the sitting man im going up there farrow told keesing you can shout to me if you want me farrow climbed up the leg of the sitting man and sat down on the large rock de fries climbed up the gully and started to search for the entrance to the tomb keesing took torches and spades out of the lorry and waited after some time de fries shouted down to keesing ive found some steps cut into the rock of the mountain keesing climbed up carrying a torch and a spade he looked at the steps an enormous rock had fallen down onto the steps from the mountain above farrows right de fries said to keesing the entrance is blocked it will take weeks to get that enormous rock out of the way keesing looked around carefully on each side of the rock and then above it i wonder whats above the rock said keesing i cant see up there well have to climb up round it farrow watched the two men climb further up the gully they climbed round the side of the enormous rock and disappeared what can i do to stop them farrow asked himself there must be something i can do but then he remembered christine and the radio call he could do nothing until keesing spoke to greer on the radio ive shown them the tomb he thought perhaps theyll let us go now suddenly de fries appeared again he climbed down the gully and hurried to the lorry then he climbed up the gully once more this time he was carrying a box of dynamite have you found something farrow shouted theres a hole in the mountain above the rock replied de fries it looks like another way into the tomb farrow sat and waited the sun had gone behind the mountain in the west about fifteen minutes later there was a loud explosion then silence suddenly there was a loud scream de fries appeared at the top of the rock but this time he did not climb down he fell from the rock and rolled over and over into the valley below he lay on the hard ground his body turning and twisting then he gave another loud scream and lay still farrow knew that he was dead farrow sat on the rock de fries was dead and there was nothing he could do for him but where was keesing if keesing was dead no radio message would be sent to greer and christine would die farrow climbed down and ran towards the gully suddenly he stopped he had heard the sound of an engine farrow looked along the valley and saw a huge lorry coming towards him the lorry stopped farrow watched in amazement three figures dressed in protective suits climbed out of the lorry one of the figures moved towards farrow it stopped when it saw the body of de fries the man looked at farrow and said who are you farrow dr john farrow they made me take them here they made me show them the tomb who are you the police no were not the police weve been following you thank you for writing such a clever book and for bringing us here let me introduce myself my name is strengel dr jusef strengel chapter eleven weve come prepared farrow had heard about dr strengel he knew that strengel was a rich man and owned a large collection of egyptian antiquities strengel pointed down at the body of de fries whats been happening here he asked keesing and de fries blew open a passage into the queens tomb replied farrow yes we heard the explosion it helped us to get here more quickly wheres keesing hes still in the tomb said farrow hes probably dead i found your book very helpful dr strengel told farrow im not a fool like keesing weve come prepared no germs can get through these suits now we can take the mummy and treasure away before inspector salahadin arrives suddenly another voice interrupted them it was keesing he had come out of the tomb while they had been talking now he was behind a rock he was pointing a revolver at strengel youre not going to take the mummy or the treasure out of this tomb strengel said keesing im going to stop you dont be a fool keesing said strengel youve been inside that tomb the germs are in your body youll soon be dead like your friend de fries it was de fries who was the fool replied keesing i didnt touch the mummy it was de fries who opened the case i didnt touch it youve been in the tomb thats enough said strengel you need help ive got medicines in my lorry and im a doctor come down and ill help you there was a loud bang a bullet from keesings revolver hit a rock near strengel that suit wont protect you if its got a hole in it shouted keesing with a laugh suddenly there was another shot from behind keesing the revolver dropped from keesings hand keesing fell slowly from behind the rock he rolled down the gully towards them the driver of strengels lorry had crept up the rocks behind keesing the driver was not wearing a suit keep away from here strengel shouted to the driver go and get your suit on its dangerous here farrow remembered that he was in danger too he moved away from the bodies lying on the rocks strengel looked down at keesing keesing was not dead but his face was turning black he was in great pain shoot me shoot me he said to strengel you were right the germs are in my body shoot me now let me die quickly you knew that you were dying and you wanted me to die in the same way was strengels cruel reply he walked away leaving keesing turning and twisting in great pain strengel turned to the two men who were with him we can go into the tomb now and get the mummy but we must he quick what about the radio message said farrow turning to dr strengel what radio message theyre holding my wife prisoner in cairo farrow explained if greer doesnt get a call from keesing before seven oclock hell kill my wife and its nearly seven oclock now i havent got time for that replied strengel cruelly he walked back to his lorry to get the equipment ready they had powerful lights spades ropes and steel bars strengel and his three men climbed up the gully they were all wearing their protective suits farrow stood thinking for a few moments then he walked down towards the lorry he would try to use the radio to speak to greer he had never used a radio before but he had watched keesing using it in the range rover salahadin had also heard the explosion thats them he said theyre near the explosion was on the other side of that mountain said the driver it wont be easy to get there which mountain asked musa the driver pointed up to a mountain top to the east thats the mountain shaped like a sitting man he said well have to get round to the other side of that mountain lets get there as quickly as we can then said salahadin the suns setting now and it will soon be dark itll be dangerous if we drive too quickly said the driver drive as quickly as you can salahadin repeated if they take that mummy out of the tomb it could be much more dangerous for everyone the driver drove the range rover round rocks and up over hills of sand the passengers were thrown from one side to the other half an hour later they reached the entrance to the valley the driver stopped we must be very near now he said to salahadin ive been in this valley before theres a gully on the west side its below that great rock on top the tomb must be in the gully good said salahadin we can walk from here they all got out of the range rover the driver pointed to some tyre marks in the sand well follow these tracks said salahadin quietly they walked slowly down the valley salahadin and musa went in front with their revolvers ready the three policemen and the driver followed them they found the two lorries standing in the valley listen whispered salahadin they stood and listened a noise came from the back of one of the lorries its someone tuning a radio said the driver i used to work as a radio operator id know that noise anywhere salahadin walked up to the back of the lorry and looked inside someone was sitting in front of a radio with his back towards salahadin put your hands up and turn round salahadin said quietly farrow was startled and jumped up and turned round salahadin was ready to shoot if the man had a gun but he recognized farrow immediately he had seen his photograph on the visa application form in london youre farrow dr john farrow said salahadin whats going on here where are the others who are you asked farrow im salahadin el nur a police officer thank goodness youve come at last said farrow farrow quickly told salahadin about the deaths of de fries and keesing and about strengel and his men wheres strengel now salahadin asked farrow started to explain about the danger in the tomb salahadin stopped him ive read your book and i know all about that tell me about strengel and his men theyre in the tomb replied farrow but theyre wearing protective suits and theyre protected from the germs theyre taking the mummy out theyre not leaving here said salahadin the queen of death must stay in her tomb forever but how are you going to stop them ive got men with me was salahadins reply farrow then told salahadin about the radio call to greer ill send the driver in to you replied salahadin he knows about radios salahadin hurried back to the others and told them what was happening he pointed to the enormous rock that had fallen over the entrance to the tomb theyve found a way into the tomb above that rock he said theyre going to carry the mummy down the gully theyre wearing protective suits and they wont be able to move easily thats where well be able to stop them salahadin then reminded them of the dangers of going too near the mummy dont go near the mummy he said remember if you touch the mummy you will die a horrible death salahadin turned to the driver go back to the lorry and help farrow send a radio message he said but do it cleverly if the person in cairo gets suspicious he may kill christine farrow salahadin sent two of the policemen up one side of the gully the third policeman climbed up the other side the policemen quietly took up their places and hid behind rocks musa climbed above the entrance to the tomb and stood in the shadow of a rock the moon shone on salahadin who was standing alone in the gully chapter twelve the radio call inside the lorry the driver looked quickly through the pieces of paper beside the radio he found notes made by keesing they were notes for his calls to greer in cairo it wont take long now he explained to farrow im going to call greer in cairo when greer replies ill cut off the power hell think that keesing is trying to get through to him hell go on trying to speak to us well pretend that were trying to speak to him that will keep him busy the driver tuned in the radio and gave the call sign a few moments later greer replied the driver immediately cut off the power and counted twenty then he switched the power on again and repeated the call sign back in cairo greer answered the call sign three times but all he got back in reply was the call sign theres something wrong with their radio he thought ill have to keep on trying by now leila was inside the house she followed fatimas instructions and made her way to the mans bedroom she stood outside the door and listened she heard the man using a radio transmitter hes busy with a radio in there she thought that gives me time to find the woman she again followed fatimas instructions and went to the locked door of the womans bedroom she stood listening but there was no sound she tapped the door lightly with her fingers and waited there was no reply she tapped the door again this time a little louder she heard the noise of someone moving who is it what do you want said a voice on the other side of the locked door i thought i heard someone crying said leila are you all right who are you im the servant replied leila are you all right can you take a message for me asked the voice a message for your husband said leila no no that mans not my husband said the voice dont tell him youve spoken to me who are you leila asked quietly my name is farrow christine farrow can you take a message to the police its all right mrs farrow said leila i am a police officer stay where you are well soon have you out of there take care whispered christine farrow the mans very dangerous and hes got a gun well take care answered leila you wait there quietly leila went back towards the front door suddenly she heard the door of the mans bedroom opening it was greer coming out of his bedroom he had remembered that the servant was still in the house greer stood outside his bedroom door and turned to lock it behind him just as he was turning the key he heard the call sign again he stood with the key in his hand ok ok im coming he said and opened the door again and went back to the radio chapter thirteen salahadin s bluff halfway up the gully salahadin stood waiting in the moonlight musa and the policemen were hidden behind rocks at last salahadin heard the noise he was waiting for strengel and his men were carrying the mummy out of the tomb he waited patiently until strengel came round the rock strengel did not notice him he had his back towards salahadin and was giving instructions to his men carefully now go carefully said strengel to the men above him a few moments later strengel turned round to look for a path down the gully he saw salahadin standing below him salahadin el nur said strengel i didnt expect you so soon have you come here to help us ive come to help you put the mummy back in the tomb replied salahadin quietly im taking the mummy away with me said strengel and you wont be able to stop me ive got my men all round you said salahadin and theyve got orders to shoot order them to shoot if you want said strengel but think what will happen before you give the order remember you havent got protective suits i was the one clever enough to think of suits to protect us from the germs without these suits you cannot come near the mummy if you shoot us well drop the mummy it will break open if it falls and the germs will spread everywhere salahadin stood looking up at strengel for a few seconds there was a strange silence in the moonlit gully ive told my men to shoot you in the legs said salahadin a space suit with holes in it will not protect you and my orders to my men are to drop the mummy if i am shot replied strengel we are coming down now strengels men began to move strengels men carefully lowered the mummy down over the large rock strengel came nearer to salahadin youd better move advised strengel salahadin waited until strengel was a few metres away then he raised his revolver stop where you are he said to strengel stop or i shoot shoot me and youll die and your policemen with you replied strengel youre all going to die anyway shouted salahadin loudly he wanted strengels men to hear him didnt farrow tell you about the acid strengel stood still and his men stopped moving what acid asked strengel theres a strong acid on the walls of the tomb and on the mummy replied salahadin the acid is slowly burning through your suits and through your gloves when it has burnt through the germs of the disease will follow it then you will all die like de fries and keesing strengels men looked at one another carefully then they lowered the mummy down onto the ground below the rock they looked at their gloves and at their space suits hes bluffing shouted strengel turning back to face them it isnt true there isnt any acid that can last for thousands of years its a bluff but his men did not move they were not sure if salahadin was speaking the truth youll soon feel the acid burning your hands salahadin shouted up at them then it will be too late the germs will be inside your suits suddenly one of strengels men began to tear off the gloves of his suit he believed what salahadin was saying the sweat caused by the rubber gloves was making his hands itch i can feel my hands burning he shouted im getting out of this suit before the germs kill me you fool shouted strengel youre sure to die now your suit is covered with germs strengel was right as the man was pulling the suit off from his legs he gave a loud scream he rolled forward and fell down the gully turning and twisting salahadin jumped to one side the man rolled past him and lay twisting in pain beside the dead body of keesing strengel suddenly ran towards salahadin he wanted to touch salahadin with the outside of his suit salahadin would die too but strengel could not move quickly because of the suit salahadin shot strengel in the leg immediately the germs got into his blood and in a few seconds he was dead salahadin shouted to musa and the policemen come out now he said watch these men then he looked up and spoke to strengels men the acid will take some time to burn through he told them before it does you have time to carry the mummy back into the tomb then well help you to take those suits off carefully strengels men did not know what to do the man lying beside keesing gave a loud scream and died you havent got much time salahadin shouted get that mummy back into the tomb quickly its your only hope of staying alive the men carefully lifted up the mummy and began to move it back into the tomb inspector musa climbed down towards them keep back keep away from them musa shouted salahadin salahadin told one of the policemen to go back to the range rover bring me the box of dynamite he said i am going to shut the queen of death in her tomb forever back in cairo leila opened the front door of the house inspector ahmed was waiting outside with the two policemen christine farrow is locked in one bedroom said leila quickly the mans in another room hes using a radio lets get him first said ahmed show me the way ahmed and the two policemen followed leila leila pointed to a bedroom door hes in there said leila ahmed walked quietly up to the bedroom door he turned the handle but the door was locked ahmed stood back with his revolver in his hand one of the policemen crashed against the door with his shoulder the door broke open and they ran into the room police the police are here shouted greer into the radio ahmed pointed his revolver at greer youre under arrest he said give me the keys to the other bedroom suddenly a voice came from the radio it was the voice of dr farrow whats happening there asked farrow what did you say about the police ahmed went over to the radio whos calling he asked farrow explained who he was and where he was calling from what about inspector salahadin asked ahmed hes here said farrow what about my wife your wife is all right said ahmed whats happening where you are farrow began to explain but

for the noise of the explosion he told ahmed were going to take shelter salahadin got out of the lorry and went with musa and dr farrow behind some rocks the policemen and strengels men went behind rocks too a few seconds later there was a loud explosion the head of the man on top of the mountain began to break into pieces the pieces fell down into the gully soon the gully was completely filled with enormous rocks salahadin and the others came out from behind the rocks well have to stay here until the sun comes up again salahadin said to musa we must make sure that everything is completely covered over ahmeds voice came from the radio in the lorry salahadin are you all right are you all right salahadin turned to dr farrow you can answer that question he said to farrow and you can say
