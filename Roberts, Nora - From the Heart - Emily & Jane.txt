chapter it was dusk that strange almost mystical interlude when light and dark are perfectly balanced within moments the soft blue would be transformed by the fiery colors of sunset shadows were lengthening birds were quieting kasey stood at the foot of the steps leading to the taylor mansion she glanced up at the massive white pillars and old rose brick with huge expanses of plate glass three stories here and there lights shone dimly through drawn drapes there was a monied dignity about the place old money inherent dignity intimidating she thought letting her eyes roam up and down again but it did have a certain style under the cover of dusk the house looked serene lifting a large brass knocker she thudded it against the thick oak door the noise boomed into the twilight she smiled at the sound then turned to watch the colors bleed slowly into the sky already it was more night than day behind her the door opened turning back kasey saw a small dark woman dressed in a black uniform and white apron just like the movies she decided and smiled again this just might be an adventure after all hello good evening maam the maid spoke politely and stood in the center of the doorway like a palace guard good evening kasey said amused i believe mr taylors expecting me miss wyatt dubiously the maid scanned her she made no move to admit her i believe mr taylor is expecting you tomorrow yes well im here tonight still smiling she strode past the maid and into the main hall you might want to let him know im here she suggested and turned to stare at a threetiered chandelier that dripped light onto the carpet watching kasey warily the maid shut the door if you would just wait here she indicated a louis xvi chair ill inform mr taylor of your arrival thank you her attention was already caught by a rembrandt selfportrait the maid moved soundlessly away kasey studied the rembrandt and went on to the next painting renoir the place is like a museum she decided then continued to move idly down the hall viewing paintings as she would in an art gallery to kasey such works of art were public property to be respected admired and most of all seen i wonder if anybody really lives here she thought and flicked a finger over a thick gold frame the murmur of voices caught her attention instinctively she drifted toward the sound she is one of the leading authorities on american indian culture jordan her last paper was highly acclaimed being only twentyfive shes rather a phenomenon in anthropological circles im well aware of that harry or i wouldnt have agreed with your suggestion that she collaborate with me on this book jordan taylor swirled a predinner martini he drank slowly contemplatively the drink was dry and perfect with only a hint of vermouth i do find myself wondering how were going to get on over the next few months professional spinsters are intimidating and not my favorite companions youre not looking for a companion jordan the other man reminded him and plucked the olive from his own glass youre looking for an expert on american indian culture thats what youre getting he swallowed the olive companions can be distracting with a grimace jordan taylor set down his glass he was restless without knowing why i hardly think ill find your miss wyatt a distraction he slipped his hands into the pockets of his perfectly tailored slacks and watched his companion polish off the martini i have a composite picture mudcolored hair scraped back from a bony face thick glasses with threeinch lenses perched on a prominent nose sensible suits to accent her lack of shape and size ten orthopedic shoes size six both men turned to the doorway and stared hello mr taylor kasey entered crossing the room she extended her hand to jordan and you must be dr rhodes weve done quite a bit of corresponding over the past weeks havent we im glad to meet you yes well i harrys thick brows lowered im kathleen wyatt she gave him a dazzling smile before turning back to jordan as you can see i dont scrape back my hair it probably wouldnt stay scraped back if i tried she tugged on one of the loose curls that surrounded her face and rather than mudcolored she continued smoothly this shade is generally known as strawberry blond my face isnt particularly bony though i do have rather nice cheekbones have you got a light she rummaged through her purse for a cigarette then looked expectantly at harry rhodes he fumbled in his pocket and found his lighter thanks where was i oh yes she continued before either man could speak i do wear glasses for reading when i can find them but i doubt thats quite what you meant is it lets see what else can i tell you can i sit down my feet are killing me without waiting for a reply she chose a gold brocade chair she paused and flicked her cigarette in a crystal ashtray you already know my shoe size sitting back in the chair she regarded jordan taylor with direct green eyes well miss wyatt he said at length i dont know whether to apologize or applaud id rather have a drink do you have any tequila with a nod he moved to the bar i dont believe we do would vermouth do that would do fine thank you kasey surveyed the room it was large and perfectly square with rich paneling and heavily brocaded furnishings an intricately carved marble fireplace dominated one wall dresden porcelain reflected in a wide mahoganyframed mirror above it the carpet was thick the drapes heavy too formal she thought observing the structured elegance she would have preferred the drapes opened wide or better yet removed completely and replaced with something a bit less somber there was probably a beautiful hardwood floor under the carpeting miss wyatt jordan brought her attention back to him as he handed her a glass each one curious about the other their eyes met then a movement in the doorway distracted their attention jordan millicent tells me that miss wyatt has arrived but she must have wandered oh the woman who glided into the room halted as she spotted kasey youre kathleen wyatt with the same wariness the maid had shown she surveyed the woman dressed in gray trousers and a brilliant peacock blue blouse kasey sipped and smiled yes i am she made her own survey of the elegantly groomed society matron jordan taylors mother beatrice taylor was carefully made up impeccably groomed and stylishly attired beatrice taylor knew who and what she was kasey thought you must forgive the confusion miss wyatt we werent expecting you until sometime tomorrow i got things organized more quickly than i expected kasey said and sipped at her drink i caught an earlier flight she smiled again i didnt see any point in wasting time of course beatrices face creased for a moment in a frown your rooms prepared she turned her eyes to her son ive put miss wyatt in the regency room adjoining alison jordan paused in the act of lighting a thin cigar and glanced at his mother yes i thought perhaps miss wyatt would enjoy the company alison is my granddaughter she explained to kasey shes been with us since my son and his wife were killed three years ago she was only eight poor dear her attention shifted back to jordan if youll excuse me ill see about your bags well jordan took a seat on the sofa when his mother slipped from the room perhaps we should discuss business for a moment of course kasey finished off the vermouth and set the glass on the table beside her do you like a strict routine you know designated hours nine to two eight to ten or do you just like to flow flow jordan repeated and glanced up at harry you know flow she made a descriptive gesture with her hands ah flow jordan nodded amused this was definitely not the straightlaced lowkey scientist of his imagination why dont we try a little of both good id like to go over your outline tomorrow and get a better feel for what you have in mind you can let me know what you want to concentrate on first kasey studied jordan for a moment as harry fixed himself another martini very attractive she decided in a smooth wall street sort of manner nice hair warm brown with just a few light touches he must get out of this museum now and then to get sunstreaked she thought but she doubted whether he was much of a beachcomber she had always liked blue eyes in a man and jordans were very dark and she thought very shrewd a lean face good bones she wondered if he had any cheyenne blood in him the skull structure was very similar the sophisticated clothes and manners were offset by a certain sensuousness around the mouth she liked the contrast he was built like a tennis player she mused good shoulders trim strong hands his tailor was obviously exclusive and conservative too bad she thought again but watch out she told herself theres a bit more here than meets the eye she had a feeling there was a temper under the cool sophistication she knew from reading his books that he was intelligent the only fault she had found with his work was a certain coldness im sure well work very well together mr taylor she said aloud im looking forward to getting started youre a fine writer thank you dont thank me i didnt have anything to do with it she smiled jordans lips curved in instinctive response even as he wondered what he had gotten himself into im very pleased to have the opportunity to help you with your research she went on i suppose i really should thank you dr rhodes for suggesting my name her gaze shifted and locked on harry well you ah your credentials were impeccable harry stammered as he tried to connect the kathleen wyatt whose papers he had read with the slim curly haired whirlwind who was smiling at him you graduated magna cum laude from maryland university thats right i majored in anthropology at maryland then took my masters at columbia i worked with dr spalding on his colorado expedition i believe it was my paper on that which brought me to your attention excuse me sir the dark maid hovered in the doorway miss wyatts baggage has been taken to her room mrs taylor suggested that perhaps she would like to freshen up before dinner ill skip dinner thanks kasey spoke to the maid directly then turned back to dr rhodes i will go up though traveling tires me out good night dr rhodes i suppose well be seeing each other over the next few months ill see you in the morning mr taylor she swept out as she had swept in leaving both men staring after her well harry jordan thought he could all but feel the room settle back into order what was it you were saying about distractions after following the maid up the stairs kasey stood in the doorway of her room pale pinks and golds dominated the color scheme pink drapes hung against oyster white walls pink and gold cushions graced ornately carved regency chairs there was a gold skirted vanity table and a large plushcovered lounge in a deeper shade of rose the bed was huge and canopied complete with bed curtains and a pink satin spread good grief she murmured and stepped across the threshold i beg your pardon miss kasey turned to the maid and smiled nothing this is quite a room the bath is through here miss wyatt would you care to have me draw you one now draw my no kasey grinned unable to do otherwise no thank you millicent right yes miss very well miss if you require anything just press nine on the house phone millicent slipped noiselessly out the door closing it carefully behind her kasey dropped her purse on the bed and began to explore the room to her mind it was entirely too proper and pink she decided she would ignore it and spend as little time within its walls as possible besides she was too tired from planes and taxis to care where she slept now she began to search for the nightgown that millicent had apparently tucked away in a bureau come on in she called as a knock sounded on the door she continued to rummage through the carefully folded lingerie she lifted her eyes to the mirror hello you must be alison she saw a tall thin child in a simply cut expensive dress her long blond hair was carefully groomed pulled neatly back with a headband her eyes were large and dark but their expression was neither happy nor unhappy kasey felt a stirring of pity good evening miss wyatt alison broke the silence but came no further into the room i thought i should introduce myself as well be sharing a bath for the next few months good idea kasey turned from the mirror and faced alison directly though i imagine wed have run across each other in the shower before too long if you have a preference for your bath time miss wyatt i would be happy to accommodate you kasey moved to the bed to drop her nightgown im not fussy ive shared bathrooms before she sat gingerly on the edge of the bed and glanced up dubiously at the canopy ill try to stay out of your way in the mornings you go to school i imagine yes im attending school this year last year i had a tutor im very highstrung is that so kasey lifted her brows and struggled with a smile im lowstrung myself alison frowned at this unable to decide whether to advance or retreat she hesitated on the threshold kasey noted the uncertainty the trained manners the hands that were neatly folded at the waist of the expensive dress she remembered the child was only eleven tell me alison what do you do around here for fun fun fascinated alison stepped into the room yes fun you cant go to school all the time she pushed a stray curl out of her eyes and im definitely not going to be working twentyfour hours a day theres a tennis court alison came a bit closer and the pool of course kasey nodded i like to swim she went on before alison could comment but im not too good at tennis do you play yes i terrific maybe you can give me some lessons her eyes swept the room again tell me is your room pink alison stared a moment trying to understand the change in topic no its done in blues and greens hmmm good choice kasey made a face at the drapes i painted my room purple once when i was fifteen i had nightmares for two months she caught alisons unblinking stare something wrong you dont look like an anthropologist alison blurted out then caught her breath at her lack of manners no kasey thought of jordan and lifted her brows why youre pretty a blush rushed into alisons cheeks you think so kasey rose to peer at herself in the mirror she narrowed her eyes sometimes i think so but mostly i think my nose is too small alison was staring at kaseys reflection as their eyes met in the glass kaseys lit with a smile it was slow warm and allencompassing alisons lips so much like her uncles curved in unconscious response i have to go down to dinner now she backed out of the door unwilling to lose sight of the smile good night miss wyatt good night alison turning as the door shut kasey sighed an interesting group she decided her mind turned toward jordan again very interesting she walked over and picked up the nightgown again then ran it idly through her hands and where she wondered does kasey wyatt fit into all of this with a sigh she sat on the lounge chair the conversation between jordan and dr rhodes which she had walked in on had been more amusing than annoying but still kasey let jordans description of her run through her mind again typical she decided a typical laymans view of a scientist who happens to be a woman kasey was perfectly aware that she had unsettled harry rhodes a smile tugged at her mouth she thought she would like him he was rather staid and pompous and she reflected probably very sweet beatrice taylor was another matter kasey leaned back in the lounge chair and ordered herself to relax there would be no common ground between herself and the older woman but kasey thought if they were lucky there would be no animosity as for the child kasey closed her eyes and began to unbutton her blouse as she lay there alison mature for her age maybe too mature kasey knew what it was like to lose parents in childhood there were feelings of confusion betrayal guilt it was a lot for a young person to cope with who mothers her now she wondered beatrice kasey shook her head somehow she couldnt picture the elegant matron mothering an elevenyearold girl she would see that alison was welldressed wellfed and wellmannered kasey felt a second stir of pity then theres jordan with another sigh kasey roused herself enough to pull off her blouse and slip off her shoes he wouldnt be an easy man to get close to kasey wasnt at all certain she wanted to standing she unbuckled her trousers and headed for the bath what she wanted was to put her education and her experience to work on his book she wanted to see the information she gave him utilized in the best possible manner what she wanted she thought and turned the hot water on full was a bath the hours on the plane preceded by a week of lecturing in new york had left her as close to exhaustion as she ever came thinking of jordan taylor would simply have to wait tomorrow she thought as she lowered herself into the tub would be here soon enough chapter contents prev next the sun glittered over the pools surface as jordan completed his tenth lap he cut through the water with strong sure strokes when he swam he didnt think but simply let his body take over as a novelist he found his mind too often crowded with characters with places with words he started off the day by clearing it with something physical that morning there had been one more character intruding into his brain kathleen wyatt he had found her fascinating he wasnt at all certain he wanted to be fascinated by a collaborator his work was important to him and the novel he was currently working on might be the most important in his career he thought perhaps it would have been better if kathleen wyatt had been closer to the woman of his imagination the reality of her was entirely too unsettling as he reached the pool edge and made to turn for another lap a movement caught his attention jordan glanced up to see a vague face surrounded by redgold curls hi shaking water from his eyes jordan narrowed them against the sun he focused on his collaborator kasey sat crosslegged at the pools edge her cutoffs and tshirt exposed skin still pale from october in new york her eyes were bright with amusement as she smiled at him entirely too unsettling he thought again good morning miss wyatt youre up early i suppose i havent adjusted to the time change her voice he realized all at once wasnt eastern but had the slightest hint of the south i went for a run a run he repeated distracted from trying to place the vague accent yes im into running she lifted her face and studied the perfect sky actually i was into running before it was something to get into even though i resent being part of a trend i cant stop do you swim every morning whenever i can maybe ill try that instead swimming uses more muscles and you dont sweat i never thought about it quite that way after pulling himself from the water he reached for a towel kasey watched as he briskly rubbed his hair his body glistening with droplets of water was lean and hard and brown there were ropings of muscles in his arms and shoulders the hair on his chest was blond like the lighter streaks on his head that the sun had bleached the brief suit clung to his hips kasey discovered she had been right about the athletic body beneath the conservative suit she felt a flutter of desire and ignored it this was not a man to become involved with and now was not the time swimmings certainly kept you in shape she observed he paused for a moment thank you miss wyatt he shook his head and picked up a short terry robe kasey stood in one swift fluid motion her head was level with his chin would you like to get started after breakfast if youve something else to do i can just go over your outline and notes myself no id like very much to get started the idea of picking your brain becomes more intriguing by the minute really her smile flashed over her face i hope you wont be disappointed jordan im going to call you jordan now wed have gotten to it sooner or later he nodded in agreement do i call you kathleen i certainly hope not she grinned no one else does it took him a moment to understand kasey then he was looking at her again in that deep searching manner that left her slightly disconcerted jordan watched a frown come and go in her eyes can we eat she demanded it would be simpler she decided if they got down to more practical matters ive been hungry for hours kasey and jordan closed themselves in the study immediately after breakfast the room was large its walls lined with books here a scent of old leather and new polish mixed with tobacco kasey much preferred it to the other parts of the house she had seen here she could detect signs of production though it was scrupulously organized production there were no scattered papers no precariously piled books large darkframed glasses perched on her nose kasey sat by the window reading jordans notes her feet were bare and one swung idly in the air as she scanned the pages she wasnt beautiful jordan decided not in the classic sense at any rate but her face was arresting when she smiled it seemed she lit from the inside out her eyes seemed to hold some private joke she was tall and boyishly slim narrowhipped and longlegged a man he thought would find angles rather than curves when he got into her bed he frowned annoyed with the turn of his mind there was a coltishness in her moves an excitement and vibrancy which raced through her conversation as well now it was as though she had turned down the power she was silent her features were tranquil her only movement was the carelessly swinging bare foot kasey had been perfectly aware of jordans survey you have a fascinating story in the works here she said rupturing the silence and the sudden hum of sexual tension that had begun between them thank you he cocked a brow he had felt the tension too and was as wary of it as she pulling up her legs kasey picked up a cigarette she held it absently while she continued to meet his eyes it would seem youre dealing mainly with the plains indian they do seem to most typify our image of the american indian though theyre the least typical of all are they he rose to light the cigarette she still held between her fingers i leave it to you to clear up the misconception and give me an accurate picture you could do the same with a few wellselected reference books she settled back in the chair why do you need me sitting back he gave her a considering look his eyes made a slow complete survey it was calculated to disconcert you didnt have to send to new york for that either she commented dryly youre not going to get maidenly blushes jordan she smiled and watched his lips curve in response ill tell you what she decided on impulse ill put an end to your curiosity then you put an end to mine im a professional anthropologist not a professional virgin now what precisely do you want from me as regards your current novel are you always so frank not always she said evasively it wouldnt be smart to get too frank with him now about your book facts details on customs clothing village life when where and how he paused and lit a thin cigar then regarded kasey through a screen of smoke those are things i can get from reference books but i want more i want why kasey crushed out the cigarette he had lit for her jordan noted that she had taken no more than two halfhearted puffs there were more nerves in her than she let show you want me to supply you with theories as to why a culture developed a certain way and why it survived or succumbed to outside pressures exactly with the storyline he was developing and the right slant it could be a marvelous book kasey thought okay she said suddenly with a flashing smile she dropped her eyes to jordans ill give you a general outline we can pick up specifics as we move along three hours later jordan stood at his window and gazed down at the pool kasey swam alone she wore a onepiece suit that clung to her he watched her dive beneath the surface and streak along the mosaic bottom she swam he decided as she did everything else with quick bursts of energy interspersed with moments of calm she was a sprinter not a longdistance runner kasey surfaced rolled to her back then floated she thought about jordan taylor as she watched a few stringy white clouds work their way across the sky hes brilliant conservative successful incredibly sexy why does that worry me she narrowed her eyes against the sun and let her mind and body drift i should be very pleased with myself to have been asked to work with him i was its probably the house she decided and closed her eyes completely theres no dust in it how do people live without dust he must belong to some very exclusive country club i imagine there are some very classy women in his life kasey swore at herself and rolled over she must have men in her life jordan thought other scientists professors probably a struggling artist or two he cursed at himself and turned away from the window kasey pulled herself from the pool and shook the water from her hair well she thought and glanced at a lounge chair if im going to live with the wealthy for a while i might as well enjoy it she flopped down and let the sun bake the chill from her damp skin there was something to be said for all this private pool private tennis court she let her gaze sweep the huge expanse of lawn bordered by lush green hedges and a stone wall she wrinkled her nose privacy weve got i wonder how often he gets out of here her mind settled back on jordan with a sigh kasey accepted the fact that he would probably continue to intrude in her thoughts closing her eyes she gave into jet lag and slept you could broil out here kasey opened her eyes slowly and focused hi she gave jordan a sleepy smile youre very fair youll burn easily the hint of annoyance in his voice registered and she studied him youre right i suppose she tested her skin by pressing a finger against her shoulder not yet she gave him another direct look is something wrong no he didnt want to admit even to himself that he had had a difficult time concentrating on his work knowing she was there within view of his window ill be a bit more up to standard tomorrow she told him thinking perhaps he was irritated that she had given him only a few hours planes wear me out it must be the altitude her hair was almost dry and she pushed a hand through it absently it appeared almost copper in the sunlight do you want me he looked at her thoughtfully yes i believe i do kasey caught the double entendre and thought it wise to stand up i dont think we meant the same thing she smiled but kept out of reach he took a step toward her surprising both of them on impulse he reached out to touch her hair youre a very attractive woman and youre a very attractive man she said smoothly and were going to be working in close quarters for some time i dont think we should complicate things im not being coy jordan im being practical i very much want to see this book through it could mean every bit as much to me as it will to you well make love sooner or later you know oh really she tilted her head yes really turning he left her alone by the pool well she thought placing her hands on her hips is that so i suppose he always gets his way she stretched out on the lounger again though his highhandedness irritated her kasey admired his directness he could drop the polished manners and elegance when he chose to he might be more difficult than she had anticipated it would be foolish to deny she was attracted to him and equally foolish to act on the attraction kasey frowned and twisted a curl around her finger what did kathleen wyatt have in common with jordan taylor nothing she would not could not involve herself emotionally or physically with a man unless there was a firm base attraction wasnt enough nor was respect there was a need for affection for friendship kasey wasnt at all certain she could be friends with jordan taylor time would tell she told herself and settled back again then a movement caught her eye looking over kasey smiled and raised her hand in a wave alison seemed to hesitate for a moment then walked over to join her hi alison did you just get out of school yes i just got home im playing hookey kasey leaned back against the cushions again ever played hookey alison looked horrified no of course not too bad it can be fun a sweet child kasey thought and much too lonely she shot the young girl a grin what are you studying american poets have a favorite i like robert frost i always liked frost kasey smiled as lines flitted through her mind his poems always remind me of my grandfather your grandfather hes a doctor in a remote section of west virginia blue mountains forest streams last time i went home he was still making house calls hell be making them when hes a hundred she thought and missed him suddenly acutely it had been too long since shed been home hes an incredible man big and strapping with white hair and a big booming voice gentle hands it would be nice to have a grandfather alison murmured trying to picture him did you see him often when you were growing up every day kasey recognized the wistfulness she reached out to touch alisons hair my parents were killed when i was eight he raised me alisons eyes were very intense did you miss them sometimes i still do shes still hurting kasey thought i wonder if any of them know it to me theyll always be young and happy together it makes it easier they used to laugh alison murmured i can remember them laughing thats a good memory youll always have it theres not enough laughter here kasey decided and felt a quick flash of anger for jordan not nearly enough alison she broke into the childs thoughts i bet you dress for dinner yes maam please kasey grinned and shook her head dont call me that it makes me feel a million years old call me kasey grandmother wouldnt approve if i called an adult by her first name call me kasey anyway and ill deal with your grandmother if necessary why dont you come up and help me find something to wear i dont want to disgrace the taylor name alison stared at her you want me to help you pick out a dress you probably know more about it than i do kasey smiled as she tucked alisons arm in hers a few hours later kasey stood at the doorway of the drawing room observing its occupants beatrice taylor sat in the gold brocade chair she wore black silk and diamonds jewels glittered at her ears and throat alison was at the piano dutifully practicing a selection from brahms jordan stood at the bar mixing a batch of predinner martinis the family hour kasey grimaced she thought of the dinners she had shared with her grandfather the laughter the arguments she thought of the noisy meals at college with conversations ranging from the intellectual to the bizarre she thought of the often inedible meals on various digs did money box you in this way she wondered or was it a matter of choice kasey waited until alison had struggled through the last notes before entering the room hi you know a person could wander around this place for days and not see another living soul miss wyatt you had only to ring for one of the staff you would have been directed to the drawing room oh thats all right i finally made it i hope im not late not at all jordan said i have only just begun to make a cocktail how about a martini or perhaps youll tell me what you want done with this tequila you got some smiling she moved to join him that was a nice thing to do may i fix it she took the bottle from jordan watch carefully im about to trust you with an old closely guarded secret kaseys grandfather is a doctor alison announced suddenly beatrice shifted her attention from the couple at the bar to her granddaughter who is kasey dear her tone was mildly annoyed one of your friends at school kasey glanced over to see alison blush im kasey mrs taylor she answered easily you have to give it a good squeeze of lemon she told jordan and demonstrated i asked alison to call me by my first name mrs taylor are you going to have one of these jordan she poured two glasses without waiting for his answer she smiled at beatrice sipped then turned back to jordan what do you think she asked him has a nice kick doesnt it he sipped watching her delicious he murmured and unexpected she gave a quiet laugh knowing he spoke of her and not the drink he found himself once more having to control the desire to touch her hair dont you like knowing where your lifes leading oh good grief no she said immediately i want to be surprised dont you like surprises jordan im not at all sure he murmured he touched the rim of his glass to hers to the unexpected then for the time being kasey wasnt at all certain what she was agreeing to but she lifted her glass for the time being she repeated over the following days jordan resigned himself to working seriously with kasey harry had been right about one thing she was unquestionably an expert in her field she was also unsettling there was a vibrant sexuality about her which she did nothing to accentuate she rarely wore anything but the most casual of clothes and almost never bothered with even the most basic cosmetics he watched her as she sat on the window sill in his study the sun streamed onto her hair it was titian in this light she wore running shorts and was again without shoes on the third finger of her right hand she wore a very thin gold band he had noticed it before and wondered who had given it to her and why he doubted she would buy jewelry of any kind for herself she wouldnt think of it with an effort he pulled himself away from the woman and concentrated on her words the sun dance was important to the ceremonial life of many of the plains tribes she had a quiet lowkey voice when she spoke like this some practiced selftorture to induce trances and to aid in receiving visions the dancer would thrust sharpened sticks through the folds of the flesh on his chest and attach the sticks to a post he would dance sing and pray for a vision until he tore himself free it was also a sign of courage and endurance a warrior had to prove himself to himself and to his tribe it was their way you approve she shot him a look that was both amused and patient its not my place to approve or disapprove i study i observe as a writer i suppose you have a different viewpoint but if youre going to write about it youd better try to understand the motivations pushing a couple of books out of her way she sat on the table if a man could endure that kind of pain selfinflicted pain wouldnt he be fearless in battle ruthless the survival of the tribe was the first priority cultural necessity he said and nodded yes i see what you mean visions and dreams were an essential part of their culture men who had strong visions often became shamans turning she began rummaging through the books on the desk theres a rather good picture blackfoot tribe if i can remember which book youre lefthanded he observed hmm no actually im ambidextrous that could account for it he said wryly for what she asked raising an eyebrow for the unexpected kasey laughed her laughter touched something off inside him you should do that more often do what laugh you have a wonderful laugh he was still smiling and it pulled at her for days she had been able to keep her feelings regulated picking up a cigarette she searched for matches of course if we laugh too much in here your mothers going to camp on the threshold he watched her pushing through books and papers why would she do that come on jordan you know she thinks i plan to seduce you and abscond with half your fortune do you have a light youre not interested in either project were business associates she said curtly she moved over to the desk still searching for matches she could feel the lightest flutter of nerves beginning she sought to settle them before they grew and though youre very attractive the money is a strike against you is that so jordan rose and joined her why people are normally attracted to money hearing the annoyance kasey sighed and turned to face him she thought it best for both of them if she made her position perfectly clear normality is relative jordan so speaks the anthropologist your eyes get very dark when youre angry did you know that money is very nice jordan i often use it myself but it tends to cloud reality whose reality my point exactly she leaned back on the desk people with your kind of money never really see life as it is for the majority daytoday struggles budgets creditors coupon clipping youre removed from all that you see that as a defect i didnt say that not your place to approve or disapprove she blew the curls out of her eyes how had she gotten into all this ill admit it makes me nervous but thats a personal problem dont you think that money tends to isolate the individual from everyday emotions all right he pulled her against him lets test your theory his mouth came to hers it was not the kiss she had expected from him it was hungry and possessive and demanded a complete unquestioned response for a moment she resisted it her mind was set firmly against surrendering but her body began to heat she heard herself moan as she drew him closer there was something almost savage in the way his mouth took hers there was no gentleness no seduction he sought her response thrived on it and demanded more she gave her own needs left her no choice his lips left hers a moment and she drew back trying to clear her thoughts oh no he kept her tight against him not yet im not nearly finished yet he exploited he ravaged he possessed he was pulling something from her that she was not yet ready to give she wanted to regain herself break free but her arms were around him her mouth was determined to have more his hand was rough when he took her breast his fingers were long and lean and made her skin burn at the touch it was more than pleasure more than passion those she had felt before here was something beyond her experience it frightened her made her ache made her answer his demand with more fervor then when she knew the border of sanity would be crossed he released her she stared up at him thoughts and emotions shuddered through her she could still feel the needs his flavor still lingered on her lips this is the first time ive seen you at a loss for words jordan murmured he slipped his hand around the back of her neck his fingers caressed kasey felt a new surge of desire shoot through her you took me by surprise she slid out of his grasp and moved away from him she was going to have to give this a great deal of thought but now wasnt the time she needed to find her balance again he watched her it pleased him to note that he had unsettled her but then she had unsettled him as well he hadnt been prepared for the intensity of the desire he had felt at the first taste of her ill have to make a habit of surprising you she turned and faced him i dont surprise easily jordan and i dont plan to have an affair with you good that should make things more interesting i plan to have one with you i miscalculated she thought to herself he isnt as bound by social conventions as i thought there is a strong ruthlessness under that social veneer she would have to be more careful she forced her voice to sound calm as she asked wasnt i about to show you a picture of a shaman he took the book from her hand and closed it firmly first things first how would you like to take tomorrow off and go sailing sailing her tone was wary just you and me thats what i had in mind the offer of freedom after days of being stifled in the house the chance to be with him away from the work was tempting too tempting she shook her head i dont think it would be wise you dont strike me as a woman who always does whats wise his hand slipped up over her cheek into her hair im making an exception i really wish you wouldnt do that she could feel her pulse beginning to hammer he kissed her gently on the temple come with me kasey i need a day away from this room away from these books perhaps just this once she thought the boat was everything she had expected sleek luxurious and expensive it had pleased her to watch jordan handle the fifteenfoot sailing yacht with an ease that spoke of long experience she sat at the bow so she could watch the boat slice through the ocean this is his escape when that world hes locked himself into becomes too much for him she mused kasey watched him at the tiller he was stripped to the waist there was power in his arms and in his eyes what would it be like to make love with him she curled her legs under her on the padded bench and studied him carefully he had marvelous hands even as she sat with the wind whipping around her she could feel the touch he would be a demanding lover she decided remembering the aggression of his kiss exciting but theres a but and im not sure yet why its there im not sure i want to know jordan looked over and caught her eye what are you thinking just working out a hypothetical problem she said coloring oh look over his shoulder she could see a school of dolphin they leaped and dove and leaped again arent they marvelous she uncurled herself to go to the stern she balanced herself by putting her hand on his shoulder then leaned further out if i were a mermaid id swim with them do you believe in mermaids kasey of course she smiled at him now dont you is this the scientist asking the question he lifted a hand to her hip next youll be telling me theres no santa claus for a writer you have a faulty imagination she took a deep breath of sea air she started to move aside but he caught her arm the boat listed a bit and his fingers tightened to hold her steady keep it light she told herself trying not to respond to his touch you can think about it over lunch hungry he smiled and rose his hands moved up her sides to rest on her shoulders i usually am id like to see what francois packed in that hamper in a minute he lowered his mouth to taste hers it was a different sort of kiss than they had shared the day before his lips were still confident but today they were gentle slower she could feel the heat from the sun the ribbons of wind as they whipped around her the scent of salt was in the air over their heads the sails flapped and billowed she was losing herself again this wasnt what she wanted this loss of power very carefully she drew herself out of his arms jordan she began then blew out a breath to steady herself he was smiling at her and the hands on her shoulders lightened to a caress youre very pleased with yourself arent you she observed as a matter of fact i am he turned away and remained busy for some moments dropping sail kasey leaned against the rail without offering assistance jordan perhaps ive given you the wrong impression her tone was lighter again more at ease i told you i wasnt a professional virgin but i dont go to bed with just anybody he didnt even glance at her im not just anybody she tossed back her hair you dont have an ego problem do you not that ive noticed where did you get that ring you wear kasey glanced down at her hand it was my mothers why just curious he picked up the hamper shall we see now what francois has packed for us chapter contents prev next the days were green and golden in the perpetual summer of palm springs the sky was cloudless the desert air dry and warm to kasey the sameness was both inescapable and stifling routines were a necessary part of life which she characteristically rebelled against the taylor household moved smoothly too smoothly there were no curves to negotiate no bumps if anything could make kasey nervous it was a perfection of organization the human condition included flaws these kasey understood and accepted but flaws were scarce in the taylor residence she worked with jordan daily and though she was aware that her lack of regimentation frustrated him she was confident he could find no fault with her information kasey knew her field she learned more of him he was an exacting disciplined writer and a demanding meticulous man he was able to extrapolate precisely what he wanted from the flood of facts and theories she provided and kasey a tough critic grew to respect and admire his mind it was simpler for her to focus on his intelligence and talent than to dwell on him as a man an individual who both attracted and unsettled her kasey wasnt accustomed to being unsettled she wasnt at all certain she liked him they were opposites in many ways he was pragmatic she voluble he was reserved she extroverted he ran on intellect kasey ran on emotion both however were used to being in control it disturbed her that she was not able to master her attraction for him kasey would never have considered herself idealistic yet she had always thought that when she became deeply involved with a man it would be with someone who would fit neatly into the packet of her requirements he would be strong intelligent with a well of emotions she could easily tap they would understand each other she was quite certain jordan didnt understand her any more than she understood him their lifestyles were at complete variance still she continued to think of him to watch him to wonder he was crowding her mind as she sat in his study reading over a draft of a new chapter kasey recognized that on this level at least they were reaching a firm compatibility he was capturing the feelings she was trying to project to him then intermingling them with dry facts and data it was proof of her own usefulness being of use was essential to her kasey laid the papers back in her lap and looked over at him its wonderful jordan he stopped typing and lifting a brow met her eyes you sound surprised pleased she corrected theres more empathy in this than i expected really the statement seemed to interest him as he leaned back in his chair and studied her it made kasey uncomfortable she felt that he was intuitive enough to see through her if he chose to that she wouldnt care for she rose and walked to the window i think you might delve deeper into the two subcultures of plains life the semiagricultural tribes of the eastern plains lived in villages and had traits of the plains as well as the eastern and southeastern cultural areas they consisted of kasey yes what she stuck her hands in her pockets and turned back to him are you nervous of course not why should i be she began to search for her pack of cigarettes when youre nervous you go to the window or he paused and picked up her cigarettes go for these i go to the window to see whats outside she countered irritated with his perception she held out her hand for her cigarettes but he put them down on the desk and rose when youre nervous he went on as he crossed to her you have a difficult time keeping still something has to move your hands your shoulders thats fascinating im sure jordan she kept her hands firmly in her pockets did you take a course in psychology from dr rhodes i believe we were discussing the subcultures of the plains indians no he reached over and twined one of her curls around his finger i was asking you why you were nervous im not nervous she struggled to keep her body perfectly still im never nervous a smile moved over his face what are you grinning at its very rewarding to unnerve you kasey look jordan i dont believe ive seen you angry before he commented then took his other hand to her throat her pulse was beginning to hammer desire stirred inside him as it played under his palm you wouldnt like it if you did im not at all sure he murmured he wanted her standing there he could all but feel the movement of her body under his he wanted to touch her to explore the sharp angles of her body and the softness of her skin he wanted her to give herself to him with the enthusiasm that was so much a part of her if he had ever wanted a woman as much before he couldnt remember its always interesting to watch a strong person lose control he told her still caressing her throat youre a very strong woman and very soft its an arousing combination im not here to arouse you jordan her body yearned for him im here to work with you you do both very well tell me his voice slid over her skin as gently as his fingers do you think of me when youre alone at night in your room no he smiled again though he drew her no closer kasey felt the needs battering inside her she was unaccustomed to restraining passion unused to feeling it necessary you dont lie well your arrogance is showing again jordan i think of you his fingers roamed to the back of her neck and tightened too much i dont want you to her voice was weak and that frightened her no i dont want you to shaking her head she pulled away from him it wouldnt work why because she fumbled and became more frightened no one had been able to do this to her before because were looking for different things i need more than youd be able to give me she ran a hand through her hair and knew she had to escape im going to take a break we can pick up after lunch jordan watched her dash from the room shes right of course he thought frowning at the closed door everything she says makes perfect sense why cant i stop thinking about her he walked around his desk and sat back down at the typewriter she shouldnt appeal to me leaning back he tried to dissect what he felt for her and why was it simply a physical attraction if it was why was he suddenly drawn toward a woman who was nothing like any other woman he had desired and why did he find himself thinking of her at odd moments when he was shaving when he was in the middle of structuring a paragraph it would be best if he simply accepted his feelings as desire and left it at that there wasnt room for anything else she was right he decided it wouldnt work he turned back to his notes typed two sentences and swore dashing through the parlor on her way to her room kasey spotted alison sitting primly on the sofa reading the girl looked up and her eyes lit hi kasey could feel nerves and longings still running through her playing hookey its saturday alison told her she gave kasey a hesitant smile oh she would have had to be blind not to see the needs in the childs eyes setting aside her own problems she sat next to alison whatre you reading wuthering heights heavy stuff kasey commented flipping a few pages and losing alisons place i was reading superman comic books at your age she smiled and ran a hand down alisons hair still do sometimes the child was staring at her with a mixture of awe and longing kasey bent down to kiss the top of her head alison she swept her eyes down the girls blue linen pants suit are you attached to that outfit alison looked down and stammered i i dont know do you have any grubbies grubbies alison repeated experimentally rolling the word around on her tongue you know old jeans something with a hole in it a chocolate stain no i dont think never mind kasey grinned at her and set the book aside with all the clothes you have one outfit shouldnt be missed come on rising she took alisons hand and pulled her to the patio door where are we going kasey glanced down at alison were going to borrow the gardeners hose and make mud sculptures i want to see if you can get dirty they stepped outside mud sculptures alison repeated as they wound their way around to the garden think about it as an art project kasey suggested an educational experiment i dont know if haverson will let you have a hose alison warned oh yeah kasey grinned in anticipation as they approached the gardener well see good day miss haverson tipped the brim of his cap and paused in his pruning hello mr haverson kasey gave him a flash of a smile i wanted to tell you how much i admire your garden particularly the azaleas this she touched a funnelshaped blossom tell me do you use oak leaves as mulch fifteen minutes later kasey had her hose and was busily manufacturing mud behind a clump of rhododendron bushes how did you know all of that alison asked her all of what how did you know so much about the flowers youre an anthropologist do you think a plumber only knows about pipes and grouting sinks she smiled over at alison amused by the concentration on the childs face education is marvelous alison theres nothing you cant know if you want to she turned off the hose and crouched down what would you like to make gingerly alison sat beside her and poked at the mud with a fingertip i dont know how kasey laughed its not acid love she plunged in wrist deep whos to say michelangelo didnt get his start this way i think ill do a bust of jordan she sighed wishing he hadnt popped into her head hes got a fascinating face dont you think i suppose so but hes rather old alison still cautious began to work the mud into a pile oh kasey wrinkled her nose hes only a few years older than i am and im barely out of adolescence youre not old kasey alison looked up again her eyes were suddenly intense youre not old enough to be my mother are you kasey fell in love her heart was lost and there was no turning back she was needed no alison im not old enough to be your mother her voice was soft understanding when the girl dropped her eyes kasey lifted her chin with a fingertip but im old enough to be your friend i could use one too really the child was crying out to be loved to be touched kasey felt a wave of anger for jordan as she cupped alisons face in her hands really she watched the smile start slowly until it bloomed over the childs face will you show me how to make a dog alison demanded and stuck her hands into mud when they walked back to the house an hour later they were giggling each carried a pair of mudcaked shoes kaseys mind was clearer than it had been for days i need her as much as she needs me she thought and glanced down at alison she laughed and stopped to lift the childs streaked face youre beautiful kasey told her bending she kissed her nose however your grandmother might disagree so youd better get upstairs and into a tub shes at a committee meeting alison commented and giggled again seeing the mud on kaseys cheek shes always at meetings then we wont have to bother her will we kasey took alisons hand and began to walk again of course youre not to lie to her if your grandmother asks you if you were building mud sculptures behind the rhododendrons you have to confess alison pushed her untidy hair behind her ear but shed never ask me anything like that that simplifies things doesnt it she pushed open the patio door i liked the dog you made i believe you have artistic talent as they walked through the brocaded parlor kasey began to search her pockets for a match the room jangled her nerves i liked your bust better it looked just like uncle jordan yes it was rather good kasey stopped at the foot of the stairs and dug in her back pockets you know i never seem to have a match when i need one i wonder why that is then noting alisons stunned expression she glanced up oh hello jordan she smiled amiably have you got a light he came down the steps slowly looking from girl to woman alisons linen pants suit was splattered with dirt her hair had escaped from its band and had traces of mud clinging to it her eyes stared out at him from a thoroughly dirty face her hands were brown past the wrist so were kaseys a dozen reasonable explanations coursed in and out of his mind and were discarded if he had learned nothing else during the past days with kasey it was to explore the unreasonable first what the hell have you been doing weve been engaged in art appreciation she returned easily very educational kasey gave alisons hand a squeeze youd better go see about that bath love alisons eyes flew from her uncles to kaseys she scurried up the stairs and disappeared art appreciation jordan repeated staring after his niece he frowned back at kasey you look as if youd been wallowing in mud not wallowing jordan creating she pushed her own untidy hair out of her eyes weve been building mud sculptures alisons very good mud sculptures you were playing in mud we dont even have any mud we made some its really very easy you just take some water for gods sake kasey i know the formula for mud of course you do jordan her voice was soothing and calm but he caught the laughter in her eyes youre an intelligent man he could feel his patience ebbing would you stay on the point what point was that she gave him a guileless smile that nearly turned into a grin as he heaved a deep breath mud kasey the point was mud well theres little else i can tell you about that you said you knew how it was made he swore as his fingers tightened kasey dont you think its a bit juvenile for a grown woman to take an elevenyearold girl and spend the afternoon in a mud pile so you know how old she is kasey thought and gave him a long look well jordan that depends on what on whether you want an elevenyearold girl for a niece or a fortyyearold midget what the hell are you talking about even for you thats hard to follow the child is bordering on middle age and youre so wrapped up in jordan taylor you dont see it she reads wuthering heights and plays brahms shes neat and quiet and doesnt intrude on your life just a minute back up a bit back up a bit her anger had a habit of springing quickly she pushed at her hair again shes just a little girl she needs you needs someone whens the last time you talked to her dont be ridiculous i talk to her every day you speak to her kasey countered furiously theres a wealth of difference are you trying to tell me im neglecting her im not trying to tell you anything i am telling you if you didnt want to hear it you shouldnt have asked shes never complained oh damn she whirled away then spun back again how can such an intelligent man make such a ridiculous statement are you really so insensitive be careful kasey he warned if you dont like being told youre a fool you shouldnt behave as one she was past caring how angry he became her own temper her own sense of justice ruled her words do you think that being housed fed and groomed are enough alisons not a pet and even a pet merits affection shes starving right in front of your eyes now if youll excuse me id like to wash this mud off jordan took her arm before she could walk by him turning her around he propelled her into a powder room down the hall without speaking she turned on the water and began to scrub jordan said nothing as her words played back in his mind in silence kasey cursed herself steadily she hadnt meant to lose her temper though she had planned to speak to him about alison she had intended to broach the subject diplomatically calmly the last thing she had wanted to do was pour out her thoughts in a torrent of abuse it had always been her opinion that the more you shouted the less you were heard she continually told herself not to become emotional when dealing with jordan taylor she continued to do so now she took the towel he held out to her and carefully dried her hands jordan i apologize his eyes were steady for what precisely precisely for shouting at you he nodded slowly for the delivery but not the content he commented and kasey sighed he was not an easy man exactly i have a tendency to be tactless he noted the way she was running the towel through her hands she was ill at ease he observed but she wasnt going to back down he felt a stir of reluctant admiration why dont you start again he suggested without the shouting all right kasey took a moment to organize her approach alison came to introduce herself to me the night i arrived i saw an impeccably groomed young girl with shiny hair and beautiful manners and bored eyes her sympathies were freshly aroused at the memory i cant accept boredom jordan not in a child with her whole life ahead of her it broke my heart passion was back in her voice but it was passion of a different kind it wasnt anger this time she was pleading with him to see as she saw jordan doubted she was even aware of the intensity of her eyes she was thinking of the child only her compassion moved him it was one more surprise go on he told her when kasey paused say it all its noneof my business kasey pulled the towel through her hands again youre perfectly free to tell me so but it wont make any difference in how i feel i know what its like to lose parents the rejection the terrible confusion you need someone to help you make sense of it to fill the holes you dont even understand theres nothing as devastating as the death of people you love and depend on she took a deep breath she was telling him more than she had intended to but couldnt seem to stop it isnt something you get over in a day or a week im aware of that kasey he was my brother her eyes searched his and found something unexpected he had loved deeply too all of her guards dropped away she reached out to touch his hand she needs you jordan theres nothing like the love of a child they dont put conditions on their emotions they simply give theres a purity to it we lose when we grow up alisons waiting to love someone again he looked down at the hand that lay on his thoughtfully he turned it over and studied her palm do you put conditions on your emotions kaseys gaze remained level once i give them no he studied her a moment with a small frown of concentration in his eyes you really care about alison dont you yes of course i do why kasey stared at him in honest confusion why she repeated shes a child a human being how could i not care shes my brothers child he returned quietly and it would seem i havent cared nearly enough touched she lifted her hands to his shoulders no not understanding and not caring are totally different the simple gesture moved him do you always forgive so easily something in his eyes had warnings hammering in her brain he was coming too close to the core of her again once he was there kasey knew shed never be free of him dont canonize me jordan she said glibly it was her most successful defense id make a dreadful saint youre not comfortable with compliments are you she started to drop her hands but he placed his on top of them to keep them on his shoulders i love them she countered tell me im brilliant and i turn to putty oh compliments on your intelligence youre used to them i imagine he smiled on the other hand if i were to tell you that you were a very warm very generous person whom i find difficult to resist youd reject that dont do this jordan he was too close and the door shut them off from the rest of the house im vulnerable yes he gave her an odd look that too is a surprise he lowered his mouth to taste her at the first touch he felt her fingers tighten on his shoulders then she relaxed and gave for the second time that day kasey fell in love she felt the loss of her heart as a physical sensation painful this time hell hurt you her mind warned but it was already too late you smell of soap he murmured as his mouth roamed over her face and there are a dozen freckles on your nose i want you more than ive ever wanted another woman his voice grew husky damn you i cant understand it when his mouth came back to hers kasey could taste the flavor of anger his tongue probed deep as he pulled her closer for the first time in her life kasey gave all body heart mind when his hands reached for her she offered no resistance but let them roam reason she knew would return all too swiftly she pulled him closer wanting to fill herself with the taste of him her fingers combed through his hair then wandered down to the muscles of his shoulders and back she wanted his strength a strength to match her own he slipped both hands under her shirt to cup her breasts her skin was impossibly soft as soft and warm as the inside of her mouth he heard her moan as his thumbs brushed over her nipples it was madness he knew but he wanted nothing else but to have her desire was pushing him as it never had before there was a temptation to pull her to the floor and take her quickly fiercely and be done with it would sanity return then would his life become his own again he pulled her away abruptly and stared down at her her breathing was quick and the vulnerability she had claimed was all too apparent in her eyes i need you he said tersely and i dont like it no she nodded understanding the feeling all too well neither do i and if i come to your room tonight dont kasey pushed her hair back from her face with both hands she had to think yet thinking was impossible when she could only feel were not ready either of us im not sure we have a choice anymore maybe not she took a deep breath and felt her balance begin to return but for a while why dont we stay out of bathrooms together he laughed and caught her face in his hand he had never known anyone else who could so easily make him laugh do you really think thats going to help kasey shook her head no im afraid it isnt but its the best i can do at the moment chapter contents prev next alison sat on the pink satin spread and watched kasey apply her makeup the pots and tubes of color which were scattered over the vanity table fascinated her approaching she began to finger them hesitantly when do you think ill be old enough to wear makeup alison picked up a pot of eyeshadow for closer study not for a few years kasey murmured as she darkened her lashes but with that face of yours you wont need illusions alison leaned over to peer at both faces in the glass but you use it and youre much prettier than i am you have green eyes so do cats kasey commented and grinned brown eyes are very effective especially on a blonde nothing devastates the human male more than soulful brown eyes and long lashes youll have boys eating out of your hand when youre fifteen she watched alison smile and blush just dont turn on the charm too early she warned and gave alisons hair a tug and no fluttering eyelashes tonight i dont think dr rhodes could handle it with a giggle alison sat down on the edge of the lounger grandmother says dr rhodes is a distinguished man and a social asset ill bet she does kasey mused to herself and picked up her lipstick i thought of him more as a teddy bear myself alison covered her mouth and rolled her eyes kasey you say the strangest things do you think so she began to search for a misplaced brush i thought it an accurate description hes all round and kind of cuddly winnie the pooh with glasses ive always been fond of winnie the pooh hes rather sweet and helpless and wise all at once have you seen my brush alison picked it up from the lounge chair and handed it to her he pats me on the head she said with a sigh stifling a grin kasey tried to convince her hair to come to order he cant help it older men who are confirmed bachelors have a tendency to pat children on the head they really dont know what else to do with them kasey picked up her perfume bottle and aimed a squirt at alison she liked hearing the child laugh lets go see if poohs here yet they entered the parlor together spotting harry rhodes across the room kasey looked down at alison and sent her a conspirators wink standing beside harry jordan noted the exchange he lost the thread of his friends conversation when was the last time he had seen alison smile that way when was the last time he had taken the time to look he felt a quick pang of guilt as a guardian he realized he couldnt be faulted but as a surrogate father he had failed completely it was time to make it up to her and to himself he laid a hand on harrys arm to stop his dissertation then crossed the room to his niece well i wasnt prepared for two beautiful females he lifted alisons chin with his hand and studied her she was quite beautiful he realized with a start and more grown up than he had thought ill have to lock you up before long if i want to keep you to myself alisons eyes widened in surprise the look alone had him berating himself for having taken her for granted how could he have lived with her for so long and not have noticed as he watched alison glanced up at kasey in confusion jordan felt a moment of panic as she looked at him again was it too late oh uncle jordan he saw alisons heart leap into her eyes love without restrictions he felt something open inside of him oh yes he said quietly and touched alisons cheek i believe ill keep you alison beatrice called from across the room where are your manners come say good evening to dr rhodes alison flashed a grin at kasey and went to do her grandmothers bidding well jordan kasey swallowed hard and cleared her throat youre quite a man he looked back at her and smiled tears kasey dont she shook her head and swallowed again ill disgrace myself briefly his eyes swept to alison i have you to thank for that oh no please kasey shook her head more fiercely he took her hand and lifted it to his lips yes i have a feeling its going to be a difficult debt to pay i had love staring me in the face and didnt see it she studied him and let out a deep breath you still do she thought its just a bit more complicated jordan unless you want to send dr rhodes and your mother into fits and soil that perfectly beautiful handkerchief you have tucked in your pocket youll change the subject and fix me a drink all right he kissed her fingers again for now through courses of onion soup rack of lamb and chefs salad harry rhodes prompted kasey with questions about the science of anthropology he was unable even with this second meeting to equate the kathleen wyatt whose work he had read and admired with the quickwitted woman who sat across from him she bounced from one subject to the next occasionally making statements that left him completely baffled because he knew jordan well he was easily able to see that his friends interest in her was not strictly academic and because kasey had come into the taylor household on his recommendation he worried had he in fact saddled jordan with a problem rather than a solution her knowledge in her field however was allencompassing by the time the peach flambé was served harry began to relax anthropology is not psychology kasey answered to one of his comments as a psychologist dr rhodes you attempt to hold culture constant and explore mind and psyche as an anthropologist i attempt to hold mind and psyche constant and explore culture i have a good book on the subject perhaps youd like to borrow it yes her conversation seemed lucid and relieved his mind id very much appreciate that miss wyatt fine if i can dig it up you can take it with you tonight she took another scoop of dessert im afraid all this is far above my head beatrice put in she sent harry a warm smile she ignored kasey completely you psychologists and anthropologists fascinate me with your theories and philosophies on life now beatrice id hardly consider my theories fascinating harry put in modestly i wonder what kaseys philosophy on life might be jordan mused he sent her one of his engaging smiles im sure wed all be fascinated kasey licked the back of her spoon from this anthropologists point of view jordan she paused to pick up her wineglass life is like a moustache it can be wonderful or terrible but it always tickles jordan laughed as harry took a rather deep swallow of wine thirty minutes later the two men were closed off in the game room jordan racked the balls on the pool table and listened to harrys uneasy comments on kasey harry theres no need to be concerned he indicated for the doctor to break kaseys giving me everything i need and more im finding the store of knowledge in that strange brain of hers incredible thats precisely the point harry broke and frowned she is strange perhaps its the rest of us who are strange jordan murmured since she had walked into his life he was no longer certain in any case she knows her field like most people know the alphabet he moved into position for a shot id never be able to get the depth i want without her he shot made his ball and moved into the next position whats more shes the most intriguing woman ive ever met youre not getting personally involved with her im doing my damnedest jordan frowned as the five ball missed the pocket jordan a personal involvement with her could interfere with your work i told you before when i read your outline its pulitzer potential you already have the reputation it might be wiser to finish the book before we start thinking about pulitzers your shot harry jordan reminded him harry made two balls and missed a third as he shot he thought over his next words carefully jordan i had noticed youd been a bit restless lately i was going to suggest a vacation when the book was finished jordan grinned and leaned over the table he positioned his cue are you trying to protect me from kasey harry i wouldnt put it that way exactly harry blustered and leaned against his stick i realize miss wyatt is quite attractive in a rather unusual fashion shes also unsettling hmm unsettling jordan murmured she does take over theres nothing i could do about it if i was sure i wanted to the one thing i am sure of is that shes opened a few doors for me i hadnt known i had closed youre not becoming emotionally harry searched around for the proper phrase entangled am i in love with her jordan frowned he sunk the nine ball and scratched i havent the faintest idea i know i want her my dear boy harry began sex is he faltered and cleared his throat yes jordan prompted failing to suppress a grin a necessary part of life harry finished stiffly harry you surprise me his grin widened your shot both men glanced over as the door burst open god jordan you really should post road maps kasey strolled in carrying a thick book ive never seen so many corridors your book dr rhodes she set it on a table and blew her bangs from her eyes have i trod on sacred ground jordan leaned on his stick why was it that a room seemed to come to life when she walked into it would it matter he asked her and smiled of course not im always treading on sacred ground can i have a drink vermouth i havent stocked tequila down here yes thanks she was already involved with a survey of the room it was large and open with a gratifying absence of silks or brocades the woodplanked floor she had imagined in the parlor was in evidence and there were simple bamboo shades at the windows it was scrupulously clean but there were signs of living a fat candle had been burnt down halfway in its pewter holder a collection of record albums were stacked on a shelf one or two of them at odd angles i like this room she said and walked to a glass table that held a few pieces of primitive pottery very much she added as she turned to accept the glass of vermouth from jordan thank you he wasnt sure why her approval pleased him but he knew it did she tilted her head as if trying to see him from a new angle this is your room she murmured like the study i suppose you could put it that way good she sipped at her drink im beginning to like you jordan i almost wish i didnt we seem to have the same problem with a nod she moved away pool huh dont let me interrupt you ill just finish my drink before i head back into the maze she glanced around the room again it was the only room in the house other than the study where she felt comfortable id like to talk to you about the book when youve finished it dr rhodes of course her smile he thought was indeed very appealing perhaps youd like to join us for a game miss wyatt he offered surprising himself thats very nice of you she smiled again and watched with affection as he straightened his shoulders im sure youre betting though arent you thats not necessary harry said oh but i wouldnt want you to change the rules for me kasey sipped again and eyed a pool stick what are the stakes perhaps theyre in my range im sure we can accommodate you kasey jordan paused to light a cigar how about a dollar a ball a dollar a ball she repeated and approached the table lets see how many are there she frowned and counted fifteen i suppose i can handle that how do you play rotation might be simplest jordan commented and glanced at harry fine the older man began to chalk his cue rotation kasey repeated then smiled as harry handed her his cue what are the rules the object is to sink the balls into the pockets in chronological order jordan explained she was wearing earrings tonight he noticed small silver hoops that caught the light even across the table her scent reached out to him he brought himself back or hit the next ball in order into another and sink that one or as many as possible hit the cue ball the white one knocking it into the other balls from the lowest number to the highest the object is to clear all the numbered balls from the table i see kasey frowned down at the green baize and nodded it certainly sounds simple enough doesnt it youll catch on miss wyatt harry told her gallantly would you like to practice first no why dont we dive right in she sent him another smile who goes first perhaps youd care to break harry continued feeling expansive as jordan racked the balls again just hit the cue ball into the rack whatever drops in is yours why thank you dr rhodes kasey walked down to the end of the table hold the cue this way jordan instructed positioning her fingers keep it steady but let it slide through see yes she glanced over her shoulder at him im to smack it into the ball marked one right thats one way to put it he could kiss her now he thought right now and send harry into apoplexy he could smell her hair as he stood over her feel the smooth skin of her shoulder under his hand i wont be able to hit anything on the table if you keep looking at me like that she murmured and dr rhodes is beginning to blush he stepped away kasey took a moment to steady herself then bent over the table and shot she sank three balls on the break moving around the table kasey positioned and shot again and again she leaned over narrowed her eyes to figure the angle and neatly sank the next ball she stopped to chalk her cue while letting her eyes sweep the table to analyze the best strategy the room was completely quiet she picked up her drink took a quick sip and went back to work there was a clatter and the thud of balls then harrys bluster as she executed a threebank shot jordan watched her as she concentrated on the next quarry leaning on his stick he enjoyed the view as she stretched out over the table in front of him and nipped the next ball into the pocket she cleared the table sending two balls into opposing corner pockets straightening she rubbed her nose with the back of her hand and smiled at her opponents lets see thats fifteen dollars each isnt it would you like to break this time harry jordan threw back his head and laughed harry he said and patted the other mans shoulder weve just been hustled chapter contents prev next jordan studied her kasey was reading over a portion of his notes in silence she had been quiet for more than twenty minutes there was something inexplicable about the way she could switch the power off and on she was teasing his mind as no other woman had ever done when he asked her a direct question about herself she answered rambling agreeably but more often than not avoiding the real question she revealed very little about kasey wyatt what secrets roamed around in that brain of hers he wondered what is it shes not telling me when she seems to be saying everything that comes to her mind and why am i obsessed with learning it all jordan frowned at her and thought of the changes she had already brought into his life a child lived in the house now there was laughter and noise and excitement how long had he let things drift for the three years alison had been with him and how long before that he had left the running of the household and the responsibility of his niece almost exclusively in his mothers hands it had been simpler simpler he reflected his life on a whole had been simpler before kasey had strolled through the front door he had been content and he realized like alison he had been bored harry had called it restlessness there was little difference no one in the household had been unaffected by her arrival his mother jordan frowned again and pulled out a cigar beatrice had already dropped a few subtle complaints but then he had learned to block out his mothers comments years before for as long as he could remember beatrice had been involved in her committees her designers her luncheons both he and his brother had been turned over to a variety of nannies and tutors jordan had accepted it now however he wondered if he had been wise to put alisons upbringing into her hands simpler he thought again but simple was often far from right apparently the time had come to take another look at things he studied kasey again quite a number of things youre very perceptive jordan kasey commented and pushed her glasses back up on her nose do you think so he asked once he would have agreed now he was beginning to wonder how much he had allowed to slip by him youve explained your characters motivation very well here its beautifully done i envy you envy me jordan took a long drag why words jordan she glanced up at him and smiled i envy you your words ive noticed you have a supply of your own barrels of them she agreed but i could never make them play like this jordan watched her eyes dart about the pages as she continued reading the manuscript you should understand you get deeper into this section the interaction between relatives in indian culture she pointed out families jordan murmured thinking of his own yes in many tribes relatives administered public rebuke offenders were often exiled that was tantamount to execution as enemy tribes would more than likely kill an exiled indian on sight a father would send a son to his death honor jordan these were a people of honor and pride dont forget that she folded her legs under her and interlaced her fingers murder was regarded as harmful to the entire tribe exile was the standard punishment not so different from what we do today behavior between relatives was often regulated by a strict code of rules kasey yes may i ask you a personal question she lifted her shoulders she brought up her guard as long as im not required to answer it he studied the ash on the end of his cigar a moment why did you become an anthropologist she grinned do you consider that a personal question its very simple really it was either that or the roller derby he sighed she was going to take him on another detour god knows why but im going to ask what does the roller derby have to do with anthropology did i say it did she took off her glasses and swung them idly by the frame i dont think so i simply gave you my two career choices i decided against the roller derby because its a hazardous profession all those bodies ramming into each other and the floors are quite hard i dont deal well with pain and anthropology was a logical alternative it was mine she studied him a moment did you know the creases in your cheek deepen when you smile its terribly attractive i want you kasey the glasses stopped on the upswing yes jordan i know you do and you want me she felt the thud of desire clearly as if she were in his arms his mouth on hers perhaps i do she dropped her eyes to his notes again and began to tidy them kasey she brought her eyes back to his when she knew what he was asking she rose then unable to sit its not as simple as you make it sound jordan why turning she stared out the window because im in love with you she thought because youre going to hurt me because im terrified i wont be able to walk away when its finished once i let you in therell be no turning back jordan she said quietly i told you i dont deal well with pain do you think ill hurt you she heard the surprise in his voice and laid her forehead against the glass oh god i know you will when his hands came to her shoulders he felt her muscles tense kasey he brushed his lips over the top of her head i have no intention of hurting you the ache was already growing already spreading intent jordan her voice was thickening he could hear the tears no i dont think thered be intent but that wouldnt stop it his fingers moved up to caress her neck she could feel her control slipping away jordan please dont she started to pull away but he turned her to face him he studied her carefully brows lowered lifting his thumb he brushed a tear from her lashes why are you crying jordan please kasey shook her head she knew she was losing i cant bear to make a fool of myself her own emotions were too strong for her pressuring her and his eyes were too direct and too demanding she could feel the ground slipping out from under her longing needs fears were crashing down on her the moment was fast approaching when she would have no choice but to give her emotions to him without restrictions let me go she told him struggling to compose herself ive given you enough this morning no his grip tightened not enough not until you explain to me why youre falling apart in front of my eyes explain to you she threw back her head in sudden anger i dont have to explain anything to you why should i i think he said slowly a more valid question is why shouldnt you she was hurting and her temper rose to protect her how could i have said you were perceptive how could i have thought that when you dont see whats staring you in the face im in love with you her breath caught on a gasp of shock and dismay they stared at each other both rocked by the words i didnt mean to say that kasey shook her head and tried to push away i lost my temper i didnt mean to say that let me go jordan no he shook her once to stop her struggles his eyes as they stared into hers were dark and intense do you think you can tell me that then walk out of here no you didnt mean to say it he said slowly but did you mean it there were no tears now her desperation had dried them if i said no i wouldnt believe you then its academic isnt it she tried to draw away again but he held her still dont pull that on me now it wont work jordan kaseys voice was steady again what do you want from me im not sure he loosened his grip abruptly aware that he must be hurting her are you in love with me kasey she started to back away but he shook his head no look at me and tell me she took a long breath i love you jordan therere no strings attached i know some people are uncomfortable being loved i dont understand it as simple as that he murmured as simple as that she agreed and smiled the weight of holding back was gone dont frown jordan she told him being loved is easy its the loving thats difficult kasey he hesitated she had moved him unsettled him until he was no longer certain what he was feeling i dont know what to say to you then its best not to say anything this isnt easy on either of us she thought and tried to smooth the path a bit jordan id like to explain myself to you id do it better if you werent touching me after a moment he released her and she stepped back the absence of contact helped steady her nerves i told you i loved you that might have been a mistake but its done id like you to accept it as its given kasey could see he didnt understand emotions given freely were always difficult to understand how could she explain to him something that her heart had accepted over the objection of her mind all of my life she continued ive been taught that to give love to express love isnt so much a choice but an obligation please just take it and dont ask me any more questions now i dont even know what questions to ask he wanted to touch her again to hold her but the expression in her eyes stopped him he didnt want to hurt her didnt want her to be right about that too kasey dont you want anything from me no she answered him quickly as though she had anticipated the question i told you there were no strings jordan i meant it i dont think we can work together any more today and i certainly dont think we can talk rationally about this right now its late in any case i told alison id let her beat me at tennis before dinner she was already heading for the door kasey it cost her a great deal to turn back around yes his mind had gone from crowded to blank he felt like a fool thank you youre welcome jordan she managed to get through the door before the pain started it was completely dark before kasey found a moment to be alone from the window in her room she could watch the moon rise it was full with an orange tint that had her thinking of fields being harvested and haystacks what was happening in the world out there she wondered ive been in this house too long trapped by a love thats going to lead me nowhere what have i done to myself its taken me a month to lose something ive valued more than anything else in all of my life my freedom kasey wrapped her arms around herself and turned back into the room even when i walk away from here from him i wont be free again love binds you i knew that and whats he feeling now what will we say to each other tomorrow can i continue to be casual to hand out wisecracks as though nothings changed she laughed a little and shook her head i have to she reminded herself always finish what you start isnt that kaseys first rule i came to do a job and the job has to be done i gave him my love without strings and i have to follow through oh god she thought and hugged herself tighter how i hate to hurt what a coward i am pressing a hand against her temple she walked into the bath to search out her aspirin itll help the headache she decided if nothing else as she reached for a cup she heard a sound from alisons room frowning kasey paused to listen it was quiet and muffled but the sound of weeping was unmistakable kasey set down the aspirin bottle and went next door alison was bundled under the blankets sobbing into her pillow everything but the child fled from kaseys mind alison she sat on the edge of the bed and touched the tangled blond hair whats wrong i had a nightmare she threw her arms around kaseys neck and clung it was horrible there were spiders everywhere she burrowed deeper as kaseys arms came around her crawling all over the bed spiders kasey squeezed and stroked terrible nobody should have to handle them alone why didnt you call me alison could hear the steady beat of kaseys heart under her ear and felt the comfort grandmother says its rude to disturb someone when theyre sleeping kasey controlled a swift powerful wave of fury and kept her hands gentle not if you have a nightmare i used to yell like crazy when i had them did you really alison lifted her face have nightmares i mean the worst pop used to say it was the price of a creative imagination he made me almost proud of them she brushed the hair away from alisons cheeks one more thing she added you could never disturb me alison with a sigh alison laid her head back on kaseys breast they were big spiders black ones theyre gone now you should try kangaroos thinking about kangaroos is much better than thinking about spiders kangaroos she could hear the sleepy smile in the childs voice absolutely snuggle down when alison obeyed kasey slipped into bed beside her are you going to stay with me her voice was small and amazed for a little while she drew the child against her and felt warm about those kangaroos kasey hmm she looked down to find alisons solemn brown eyes on her i love you here it was kasey realized without condition without demand pure love until that moment she hadnt known just how much she had needed it i love you alison close your eyes jordan stood in the doorway and looked down on the two sleeping figures alisons head rested in the crook of kaseys shoulder he had lost track of the time as he stood there captivated by the picture they made each was turned into the other as if they had found something they had been looking for they both belong to me he thought surprised by the warmth that flooded through him they had both loved him and he had been blind to it now that he knew what was his next move love wasnt as simple as kasey had told him he thought about the way they had looked at him alison stunned and hoping kasey exposed and frightened walking over to the bed he watched them sleep bending over he moved alison gently she stirred once and then was still deep in a childs sleep carefully he lifted kasey into his arms she murmured something wrapped her arms around his neck and settled into his shoulder there was something in the trust of the gesture which aroused him more than a planned seduction he turned to carry her through the connecting doors kaseys eyes opened slowly to stare at him jordan she was disoriented and her voice was thick with sleep kasey he kissed her brow how could she go from innocent to striking by merely opening her eyes what are you doing trying to decide whether to take you to your room or mine he paused at the doorway of her room why were you in alisons bed spiders kasey remembered and tried to clear her head i beg your pardon she had a nightmare she sighed kasey had never been one to wake up on a bounce what were you doing in there ive started to look in on her at night something i should have been doing long ago with a smile kasey touched his cheek youre a nice man jordan i wasnt certain she yawned and rested against his shoulder again you can put me down anytime with barely any effort at all she could have been fast asleep again kasey he noticed the pillow and blankets on the lounge chair why dont you sleep in the bed claustrophobia she told him drowsily between the canopy and those bed curtains i feel like im in a coffin im going to be cremated its a simple matter to change your room she snuggled against him and sent a shaft of desire through him no it doesnt matter the lounge is fine and the staff already think im eccentric i cant imagine why jordan put her down on the lounge and sat beside her you always smell of violets he murmured his mouth sought hers and found it soft and warm and giving he knew the exact moment when sleep cleared from her brain jordan kasey was wide awake and throbbing you have me at a disadvantage she put her hands to his chest and held them firm yes i know i wondered if i ever would he took one of her hands and pressed his lips to the palm i intend to take advantage of it kasey he trailed a finger over her shoulder down her breast he could feel the nipple strain against the thin material tonight he murmured now jordan the needs were churning demanding satisfaction i told you before theres a matter of choice you also told me only a few hours ago that you loved me he lowered his mouth to hers again good god he wanted her no woman had ever made him ache like this the desire was in his blood in his bones she might have a choice but she left him none i told you i loved you kasey called out the last ounce of strength i didnt tell you i would make love with you youve got to leave me something jordan she couldnt allow it to happen she knew that once she shared herself with him once she gave she would tie herself to him completely it wasnt a simple matter of wanting to be touched or feel pleasure it was a matter of needing to belong jordan studied her in silence still holding her hand in his she was defenseless again as she had been when sleeping with the child he wouldnt hurt her he swore to himself that he wouldnt hurt her but he couldnt leave her when he released her hand and rose to go to the door that adjoined alisons room kasey let out a quiet sigh but he closed it and turned back to her she sprang up prepared to send him away kasey he crossed to her but kept his hands by his sides let me love you tonight i need you its the first time in my life ive needed someone else there was no sending him away she might have resisted a seduction she would have refused a demand she was powerless against a need kasey drew him into her arms his mouth was instantly desperate crushing down on hers until they were both reeling he held her close tightly as though he feared she would spring away from him but what she had offered she would never take back he tugged the nightgown from her shoulders anxious to feel her skin he thought again how thin she was how he had to take care lest he snap her in two but his hands refused to be gentle kasey felt no pain only rocketing pleasure she could sense the urgency bursting from him she wanted him to need her for now it was enough she pulled him toward the bed and he was on top of her she wanted his weight she was impatient with the clothes that separated them her mouth hungered she poured herself into him through the kiss it grew long deep totally involved until his hands stopped searching for her it calmed them both slowly with care he began to undress her there was no longer a pressing drive for quick release he wanted to savor her he took his lips to her throat and her sigh of pleasure rippled through him still seeking but no longer desperate he moved to her breast kasey pushed at his robe until she could feel his skin under her hands she found the strength she wanted she let him take her deeper slowly with not so much tenderness as thoroughness neither of them looked for tenderness now that was for later perhaps when the heat was less intense and the strength was sapped he nibbled at her breast experimenting with textures and flavors she slipped the robe from his arms and then he was as naked as she he flicked his tongue over her nipple then made a leisurely journey back to her neck the flavor there was dark and heated drawing him she let her hands roam where they pleased testing muscles exploring the outline of ribs skimming over hard narrow hips she was lost in the feel of him he was everything she had wanted and his lips on her neck were sending her into a delirium of pleasure wanting his taste again she murmured to him so that he brought his mouth back to hers a storm was building she could feel it in the texture of the kiss her body was already answering moving under him agreeing demanding the breath moaned out of her lips and into his he slid his hand over her breast down to her hip her thighs were slim and strong her fingers gripped his shoulders her body ached with passion she opened for him already shuddering she was hot and moist he wanted to see her without control his own was ebbing quickly too quickly he didnt want to end it he wanted to keep touching her tasting her he wanted to keep hearing her moan his name it aroused him to near madness his blood was pounding but still he lingered letting his lips brush over her hip his tongue trace over her stomach he could hear her breathing quick and short she moved under him with complete abandon she was totally his he needed to know it and didnt question the reason when he brought his mouth back to hers he knew she had lost all restraint all control he felt a surge of power knowing that he and he alone held the key to her then she took him and drew him inside her his thoughts shattered he was hers kasey curled up against him and drifted in the afterglow of drugged contentment she felt no regrets she loved she knew only that she had found the man she had waited for her whole life she would have him for as long as she would be allowed tomorrows could be dealt with when they came tonight she had everything she wanted jordan lay quiet in the darkness his body was relaxed he hadnt realized the tension he had subjected it to over the past weeks but his mind its never been like that before he thought a bit dazed by the knowledge i cant say that to her shed never believe it im not sure i do myself she pulls at me i shouldnt let her he closed his eyes and tried to sweep his mind clear but she was warm and soft against him and her hand was on his heart sweet lord ive just had her and i want her again shes like a narcotic he wanted to be angry to resent what she was doing to him but he couldnt fight his way past the simple need for her he heard her sigh and felt her head move as she looked up at him jordan yes before he could prevent himself his hand reached down to stroke her i completely forgot about the canopy isnt that odd glancing down he saw the shine of laughter in her eyes all the doubts and strain slipped out of his mind as he smiled there was no resisting her a cure for claustrophobia definitely she rolled on top of him but a scientist always tests her theory several times would you be willing to donate your body to the experiment definitely he pulled her mouth down to his chapter contents prev next the nomadic tribes of the high plains lived almost completely on the buffalo they had no agriculture and did little fishing kasey yawned and sat back in her chair sorry she smiled over at jordan i had a late night her casualness this morning wasnt a pretense she was at ease she had told him she loved him she had acted on that love and she had no regrets the tension she had felt before had come from fighting her own instincts and concealing the truth i wonder jordan if i could momentarily abandon my values and ring for some more coffee she yawned again he studied her as she took a long luxurious stretch you dont like servants do you of course i do kasey leaned her elbows on her folded legs what i dont like is having them about that coffee jordan id make it myself but francois doesnt like anybody mucking about in his kitchen why dont you like having them jordan i cant philosophize properly on three hours sleep she sighed when he only continued to study her what color are millicents eyes what the hell does that have to do with anything only to point out that people rarely notice the people who serve them i waited tables in college and you were a waitress yes does that surprise you it flabbergasts me he grinned at her i cant picture you balancing trays and scribbling orders i was a terrific waitress she frowned and pushed her glasses up on her nose what was i trying to say when how is it you can be so cleareyed and annoying this morning when you didnt have any more sleep than i did he smiled at that as he rose and walked to her because ive been sitting here listening to you spout information on the arapaho and various plains tribes and thinking that the thing i want most to do is make love to you again he pulled her to her feet right now she accepted the kiss with a murmur of agreement if she had one disappointment it was that she had been unable to wake beside him that morning but there had been alison to think of last night she thought now as her mouth heated under his had been much too short and the night to come was too far away i dont think were going to get much work done this way she murmured were not going to get any done jordan slipped the glasses from her face and put them behind him on the desk come on where upstairs he was already pulling her to the door jordan kasey laughed and tugged on her hand its eleven oclock in the morning ten minutes of he corrected glancing at the clock as they passed through the parlor jordan youre not serious about this tell me that in half an hour he was propelling her up the stairs alisons in school my mother is at one of her famous committees and i want you he opened the door to his room in my bed she was inside and locked in his arms there was no denying his hunger she was already dizzy from it his mouth was ravaging hers as if he had been starved for the taste jordan kasey managed to breathe when his lips sought her throat were hardly alone here i dont see anyone else he murmured as his lips trailed up to her ear she moaned and tried to keep her balance there are servants all over the house this time of morning he pulled her to him for a brief hard kiss then released her kasey felt the earth tilt in two strides jordan was beside the phone he lifted the receiver and pressed a button without taking his eyes from her john give the staff the day off yes the entire staff right now youre welcome jordan replaced the phone and smiled at her fifteen people are about to be very grateful to me sixteen kasey corrected thank you jordan he crossed back to her for what for understanding that i needed to be alone with you really alone its important to me he lifted a hand to her cheek she was becoming important to him he realized very important you will have to make your own coffee now he murmured what coffee with a smile kasey began to unbutton his shirt would you like to hear my opinion of coffee not now jordan felt the need pushing at him as she moved to the second button well i suppose i might bore you with it she mused loosening the third button the one thing i dont think you could possibly do is bore me kaseys fingers stopped and her smile spread slowly thank you jordan thats a very nice thing to say deliberately he took his fingers to the top button of her own shirt but if i were to tell you that you were the most generous the most genuine person ive ever known youd change the subject the warmth filled her and clouded her brain she didnt know how to answer was terrified she would overreact and spoil the moment being in love she discovered made it more difficult to harness the emotions and more necessary yes i imagine i would id probably say something like where do you get your shirts this material is really marvelous kasey her eyes came back to his youre beautiful she laughed at that instantly more at ease no im not you have a dimple at the right corner of your mouth when you smile when youre aroused your eyes darken and cloud so that the gold in them vanishes she could feel her pulse start to hammer her skin flush with heat are you trying to unnerve me jordan oh yes he slipped her shirt from her shoulders then he took his hands down her breasts to her waist am i she was trembling it stunned her he had barely touched her and her body was throbbing for him he had too much power over her in every aspect heart body and mind she resisted it she had given him her love but refused to surrender her strength he had to want her every bit as much as she wanted him kasey loosened his last button you unnerve me jordan she whispered and ran her hands up slowly over his stomach ribs and chest she could feel his muscles go taut under her palms as she drew off his shirt she pressed her lips to his shoulder you make me ache she trailed her fingertips back down his sides and took her lips to his throat you make me want she unhooked his slacks and let her fingers guide them over his hips as her lips traveled down his throat she heard his low moan of pleasure she pulled him to the floor passion had tastes his skin was hot and moist from it where she kissed him she could feel the thud of his heart under her tongue it was like a dream her body was drugged but her mind was active she wanted to know all of him what pleased what aroused she followed instinct letting her hands roam when she felt a response she let them linger his body was wellmuscled and lean and it excited her his needs excited her she could feel them pouring out of him for this one moment of time he was as vulnerable as she she left a slow lingering trail of kisses as she journeyed back to his throat his breathing roared in her ears tangling his fingers in her hair he groaned her name and pulled her mouth to his passion exploded in the kiss she felt it whipping at her an incredible mixture of pain and delight his teeth dug into her lip and she moaned this was no dream but shattering reality his hands were suddenly rough and bruising as he pushed her on her back he entered her swiftly violently and plunged her over the edge of reason she went with him clinging helpless strong she knew she had stopped breathing they were fused together by damp skin and desire they rose and crested again and again until there were only drained bodies and empty minds he lay on top of her his face buried in her hair unable to move though he knew she was too slight for his weight her body was still trembling lightly under his jordan lifted his head he wanted to see her in the full light of day after his loving her face was soft her eyes still misted he felt a pain both unexpected and sharp slam into his stomach she smiled and the pain grew could he want her again so quickly surely that would explain the ache he felt by just looking at her he lowered his mouth to hers but it was tenderness that greeted him not passion kasey he kissed her cheek not certain what he was about to say the emotions he felt were utterly new to him there was a bruise on her shoulder and he lifted his head again to look at it it was small and faint and fit the pattern of his finger it horrified him to his knowledge he had never marked a woman before whats wrong kasey saw the shock in his eyes and followed their direction she smiled a little when she noted the bruise you have strong hands she commented his eyes came to hers it was difficult for him his feelings about bruising a woman were very defined he found no excuse for it abruptly he remembered the look on her face when she had told him he would hurt her kasey he shook his head i dont want to hurt you jordan she recognized the deeper meaning in his words and lifted her hand to his cheek i know you dont when he rolled over on his back she went with him to rest her head against his shoulder dont think about tomorrow now she murmured lets take today its enough he pulled her closer drawing her into the curve of his body today he thought and closed his eyes youre tired he had heard the fatigue in her voice you did say something about a bed she returned but she was content to stay where she was close to him he rose and before her protest was complete he lifted her into his arms you need to sleep awhile when he laid her on the bed kasey reached out to him sleep with me jordan pulled back the covers and drew her into his arms it was late afternoon when kasey woke she remembered when jordan had left her urging her to stay and sleep she had pulled him back for a kiss that had led to another storm of loving a glance at his clock told her he had left more than an hour before lazy she told herself and stretched if he had still been with her kasey would have found it no effort to roll over and go back to sleep she pictured him down in the study working she still had a job she reminded herself she pulled herself from bed and dressed halfway down the stairs she heard alison practicing the piano beethoven this time a lovely piece played without interest she paused in the doorway and watched shes doing her duty kasey thought with a stir of sympathy did you know beethoven was considered quite a revolutionary in his day alisons head shot up at kaseys voice shed been waiting to hear it since shed returned from school kasey smiled and crossed to her his music is so full of power alison glanced down at her fingers not when i play it uncle jordan said you were sleeping i was kasey stroked a hand down alisons ham you play very well alison but you dont put yourself into it its important to have a firm basis in the classics alison stated kasey could hear beatrice in the words and bit back a sigh music is one of the greatest pleasures in life alison shrugged and frowned at the notes i dont think i like music i might be tone deaf this time kasey struggled with a grin that could be a problem an idea shot into her head hang on a minute she bounded from the room alison heaved a sigh and went back to beethoven she was still fighting with the notes when kasey returned this is a good friend of mine kasey informed her and set down a guitar case hes good company she went on as she pulled the battered instrument from the case he travels well i dont she smiled at alison and was satisfied that she had caught the childs interest i can take him with me on a dig or on a lecture tour which makes him more practical for me than a piano i need music she began to tune the guitar as she spoke alison rose from the piano stool to take a closer look it relaxes me pleases me soothes my nerves its also nice to play and do the same for someone else i never thought about it that way alison reached out to touch the neck of the guitar you cant play beethoven on this oh no drawing on memory kasey began to play the movement alison had been practicing alisons eyes widened she knelt down to watch more carefully it doesnt sound the same different instrument kasey stopped to cup the childs chin different feeling music comes in all forms alison but its still music why doesnt anyone take the time to talk with this child kasey wondered she soaks up words like a sponge will you play something else alison settled down at kaseys feet it sounds beautiful maybe youre not tone deaf after all kasey smiled at her as she began to play again jordan stood in the doorway and watched them would she ever stop surprising him he thought it wasnt her playing that surprised him if he had learned she had conducted an orchestra he wouldnt have batted an eye he doubted there was anything she couldnt do but her capacity to give and draw love overwhelmed him was she born with it did she learn it was she even aware of the power she had alison loved her he could see it in her eyes she simply accepted kasey for what she was and loved there were no questions no doubts and kasey gave it back to her in the same way but i have doubts he mused and questions shes right again when we grow up we lose the talent for loving without restrictions kasey glanced up and saw him a smile moved across her face hello jordan this is the music appreciation hour he returned the smile am i invited uncle jordan alison scrambled up and forgot to brush out the creases in her skirt you should hear kasey play shes wonderful i did he glanced at kasey again you are alison was having a little difficulty with beethoven kasey explained so i went upstairs for my friend hes been helping me he jordan shot alison a look as he sat on the sofa he pulled her down on his lap dont you think its rather odd to call a guitar he alison giggled and looked up at him i did but i didnt like to say so very discreet he nuzzled her neck alison responded by flinging her arms around him and clinging the depth of his reaction shook him kasey had told him there was nothing comparable to a childs love but he hadnt fully understood now with the small girl hugging him he felt the total power of it how had he missed it before how had he ignored it closing his eyes he held her close and let the sheer pleasure of unconditional love run through him she smelled of powder and shampoo and her hair was fine and soft against his cheek his brothers child his now and hed already wasted too much time i love you alison he murmured he felt her grip tighten really her voice was muffled against his neck yes he kissed her hair really he heard her sigh and relax she kept her face buried against his neck he opened his eyes and met kaseys she was weeping silently when he looked at her she shook her head violently as if to deny the tears she rose but he stopped her before she could dart from the room dont go was all he said she turned back to look at him then began to fumble for a cigarette for the first time he heard her swear at the lack of a match she walked to the window and stared out i love them both she thought and rested her forehead against the glass much too much to see them together like this to watch them find each other the joy of it filled her she sighed and let the tears run their course he had looked so stunned when she had put her arms around him kasey could see each emotion move through him how much time do i have before i lose them both taking a deep breath she worked to bring herself under control i wont think about it now i cant think about it now when i opened the door i knew it was going to shut in my face sooner or later she felt the pain ebbing kasey brushed the drying tears from her cheeks she turned back just as beatrice glided into the room jordan ill be leaving now the conway party seeing alison on his lap she frowned is alison ill no he felt the child straighten and kept his arm around her allisons fine enjoy yourself she lifted a brow you should be attending yourself you shouldnt neglect your social duties ill have to neglect them awhile longer give my best to the conways beatrice sighed as she turned to leave she spotted kaseys guitar what is this thats a guitar mrs taylor kasey stepped back into the center of the room im aware of that miss wyatt beatrice sent her an arched look what is it doing here its kaseys alison put in she felt protected and secure in jordans arms shes going to teach me to play she glanced up at kasey having taken this for granted is that so beatrices voice was clipped and frosty and what possible use would it be for you to learn such an instrument its essential that a child develop an interest in music at an early age dont you agree mrs taylor kasey smiled and cut off the cold response jordan had on the tip of his tongue he saw his mothers brow crease and relaxed again naturally im an advocate of introducing children to the classics and all forms of music in infancy there have been some very interesting studies on the subject im quite sure there have beatrices eyes swept back to the guitar but the spanish guitar such as this one was developed from oriental models during the seventeenth century kasey had on her lecturing voice and jordan was struggling with a grin his mother was definitely outmatched during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a succession of spanish virtuosos including as im sure you know andres segovia have proven the guitar to be an important artistic instrument im sure youll agree that broadening alisons musical abilities will be a tremendous asset to her when she takes her place in adult society beatrice was still frowning but looked a trifle dazed kasey gave her a friendly smile thats a lovely dress mrs taylor she added beatrice glanced down at the mauve silk thank you she brushed absently at the skirt i had planned to wear my white voile but its rather cool tonight one doesnt wear white when its cool really kaseys brows lifted curiously that dress doesnt appear very warm beatrice sent her a disparaging glance i have a mink to wear over it she turned and left the room not at all certain how she had lost the upper hand my my my kasey muttered arent i a fool a very cagey one jordan remarked his mother had annoyed her that was clear enough but she had kept her temper much more under control than he would have and there was still a trace of humor in her eyes he laughed suddenly your grandmother has just been confused by a master he told alison oriental guitars and seventeenth century he shook his head is there anything you dont carry around in that encyclopedia you have for a brain kasey was thoughtful for a moment no i dont think so is there something youd like to know he tilted his head amused at the challenge whats the capital of arkansas alison giggled and whispered in his ear arkansas kasey murmured her gaze wandered to the ceiling arkansas south central united states north boundary missouri east boundary mississippi and tennessee south louisiana west texas and okalahoma twentyfifth state as of june eighteenthirtysix arkansas has soil favorable to agriculture numerous mineral deposits that include the only diamond mine in the united states and extensive forest areas the name comes from a siouan tribe the quapaw there are no natural lakes of importance and it has a relatively mild climate oh yes she held up a finger little rock is the capital as well as the largest city she dropped her eyes from the ceiling and smiled guilelessly at jordan would anyone like to take a walk before dinner chapter contents prev next the climate in palm springs was dry and warm and sunny the servants in the taylor household were welltrained solicitous the food was invariably superb and the monotony of it all was driving her crazy if kasey could have loved jordan less she could have escaped but as each day passed she knew she was adding links to the chain that kept her there the time she spent with jordan on research was a stimulant as was the time she shared with alison but there were long hours with only idleness and she had never been able to cope with idleness in the night in jordans arms she could let herself forget everything else but their hours together as man and woman were all too brief when he would leave her bed she was left with too much time to think it was difficult for her to admit that for all her sophisticated education and freethinking ideas she was uncomfortable in an affair perhaps if the relationship could have been more open she would have had less doubt but there was a child to think of it was already december for kasey time was running out in another month perhaps six weeks her usefulness would be at an end and what then she asked herself as she stepped outside how much longer could she put off thinking about the future she should have been booking another lecture tour for january she should have found out if the patterson dig was going on schedule in march she stuck her hands in her pockets and stared at a palm tree she needed to get away she decided she needed to start thinking about herself again she had to write her doctorate she shut her eyes against the glare of the sun if she didnt start to make the break soon it would hurt much much more when the time came how would jordan feel when she left kasey stepped from the patio onto the lawn would he feel as though hed lost something or would he simply remember their time together as one pleasant autumn as someone who made it a habit to pick apart the human brain she found it strange that she couldnt fully understand jordans perhaps it was because he was more important than anyone else had ever been emotions clouded her intuition and she couldnt see clearly she was only certain of alison she had the childs love it was simple open at eleven a child had no masks how many does he have she wondered thinking of jordan how many do i have why do we insist on wearing them she looked around again at the smooth even lawn the perfectly groomed trees and organized flowers i have to get away from here she thought again i cant stand the spotlessness much longer kasey she turned to watch alison dart toward her a few steps ahead of jordan and when i do go she reflected theyll have each other that much i can take with me we couldnt find you alison grabbed her hand and smiled up at her we wanted you to go swimming with us the simple request set off a chain of emotional reactions they dont belong to you she reminded herself as her heart reached out for them youve got to stop pretending they do she kept her eyes on the child unwilling to deal with one of jordans intuitive looks not today love i was just going for a run swimming uses more muscles jordan commented and you dont sweat kasey lifted her eyes to his she watched jordans narrow immediately and recognized that he sensed something of her mood she wasnt willing to be seen so clearly smiling she gave alisons hand a quick squeeze i still think id rather run she turned and streaked away somethings wrong with kasey alison looked up at her uncle but he was watching kasey dash for the wall that bordered the estate her eyes looked sad jordan glanced down at alison her words had mirrored his thoughts yes they did have we made her sad uncle jordan the question struck him and he looked up in time to see kasey disappear through the side gate have we her capacity to feel was beyond anyone elses he had known didnt it follow that her capacity to hurt was just as great jordan shook his head perhaps he was reading something more into a simple mood everyone has moods alison he murmured even kaseys entitled to them when he glanced down at the child again her eyes were still on the side gate jordan swung her up over his shoulder to hear her laugh dont throw me in she laughed and wiggled throw you in jordan countered as if the thought had never occurred to him he mounted the steps to the pool what makes you think id do a thing like that you did yesterday did i he glanced over his shoulder at the hedges and wall kasey was on the other side it gave him an uncomfortable feeling with an effort he brought his attention back to alison i hate to repeat myself he said and tossed her in an hour later he found kasey in the drawing room the run hadnt helped her mood he watched as she paced from window to window he felt her restlessness thinking of making a break for it kasey whirled around at his voice i didnt hear you come in she searched for an ease she couldnt find then turned away again ive changed my mind she told him this place isnt a museum its a mausoleum jordan lifted a brow then took a seat on the sofa why dont you tell me whats wrong kasey when she turned back there was a flare of anger in her eyes it was easier to feel anger than despair how can you stand it she threw out at him doesnt the everlasting sunshine ever get to you he studied her a moment then leaned back against the cushions are you telling me youre upset about the weather it isnt weather she corrected weather changes kasey pushed her hair away from her face with both hands she felt a dull throbbing ache at the base of her neck kasey jordans voice was quiet and reasonable sit down and talk to me she shook her head she had no desire to be reasonable just yet it amazes me she continued absolutely amazes me that you can write the way you do when youve cut yourself off from everything his brow went up again do you think thats an accurate statement i live in a favorable climate so ive cut myself off youre so damn smug she spun back away as her hands balled inside her pockets you sit here in your sanitized little world without an idea as to how people struggle through life you dont have to worry if your refrigerator breaks down kasey jordan struggled to keep his patience youre veering off again she turned back and stared at him why couldnt he understand why couldnt he see what was underneath it all not everyone can rest on his laurels and bask in the sun oh were back to that jordan rose and crossed to her why is it you consider my money a black mark on my character i have no idea how many black marks you have on your character she retorted my objection to your money is that you use it to insulate yourself from your viewpoint all right she nodded in my view this entire section of california is an outrage golf furs parties jacuzzis excuse me alison stood in the doorway and stared at both of them it was the first time she had seen either of them angry jordan stifled a reply and turned to her is it important alison his voice was calm but his eyes werent kasey and i are having a discussion were having an argument kasey corrected people have arguments and i never shout during a discussion all right he nodded at kasey then looked back at his niece were having an argument would you mind giving us a few minutes to finish it alison took a step back but hesitated are you going to yell at each other and everything there was more fascination than concern in the question and jordan held back a smile yes kasey told her alison took a long last look then darted for the stairs jordan laughed before he turned back to kasey shes apparently pleased at the prospect of a riproaring fight shes not alone he studied kasey a moment no i can see shes not maybe youd like to throw something thats always a nice touch which do you want to lose she shot back hating that he was controlled and she was not the ming vase or the faberge box kasey he put his hands on her shoulders enough he thought was enough why dont you sit down and tell me what this is really about dont patronize me jordan she stepped away from him temper snapping i get enough of that from your mother there was little he could say to that as he knew the truth of it what he hadnt known was that kasey had been touched by beatrices attitude in any way perhaps there were many things he still had to learn about kasey and perhaps the time to learn them was when she was upset enough to lower her guard my mother has nothing to do with you and me kasey his voice had softened but he didnt reach out to her doesnt she kasey shook her head how could it be that he didnt notice it or understand how difficult it was to make love with him in a house in which she had to deal with constant disapproval well thats one small point of disagreement we have several others which are doesnt it worry you that the most important thought in alisons head in five years will be what dress she wears good god kasey what are you talking about frustration made his voice as hot as anger made hers will you come to the point of all this point she shouted at him now enraged by her inability to express her feelings and his inability to understand what she was trying to say what point is there when youve absolutely no concept of how i feel or what i need she shook her head again there is no point jordan no point at all with this she fled through the patio doors ten minutes later kasey sat under an oak tree in the north corner of the lawn trying to gain control of her emotions she detested losing her temper nothing she had said to jordan had made sense to him and barely to herself honesty forced her to admit that it was basic fear that prevented her from speaking what was in her heart she loved him too much for her own peace of mind heart or intellect which should she listen to her intellect told her she shouldnt love him he didnt love her wanted her needed her perhaps cared for her all mild pale words compared to love intellect reminded her that there were too many essential differences between them to make anything but the most transitory relationship possible intellect stated it was time to remember her priorities her doctorate her work in the field it was time to pull up stakes and get back to it but her heart thrust the love on her she was caught between the two heart and intellect and she was unable for perhaps the first time in her life to make a clear decision she pulled up her legs and rested her brow on her knees when she heard jordan sit down beside her kasey didnt move she needed another moment and he sensing it said nothing they sat together close but not close enough to touch while a bird began to sing in the leaves directly above their heads she sighed im sorry jordan for the delivery but not the content he returned remembering the other time she had apologized she gave a quick laugh but kept her head on her knees im not really sure i dont think id mind being shouted at if i knew why blame it on the waning of the moon she murmured but he slipped a hand under her chin and lifted it kasey talk to me she opened her mouth but he cut her off before she could speak really talk to me he added quietly without the clever evasions if i dont know you or what you need it might be because you do your best to keep me from finding out her eyes were very clear and directly on his im afraid to let you in any more than i already have her candor unbalanced him after a moment he leaned back against the trunk of the tree and drew her to his side perhaps the easiest place to begin to learn of her was through her background tell me about your grandfather jordan requested alison said he was a doctor my grandfather kasey stayed in the circle of his arm and tried to relax the subject seemed safe enough he lives in west virginia in the mountains she looked out at the even cropped lawn there wasnt a rock in sight hes been practicing for nearly fifty years every spring he plants a vegetable garden and in the fall he chops his own wood in the winter the house smells of wood smoke she closed her eyes and leaning against jordan let herself remember in the summer there are geraniums in the window box outside the kitchen what about your parents he felt the tension seeping out of her as the bird continued to sing out overhead i was eight when they were killed kasey sighed again each time she thought of them the needlessness for their death swept over her they were taking a weekend together i was with my grandfather they were coming back for me when another car crossed a divider and hit them head on the other driver had been drinking he walked away with a broken arm they didnt walk away at all her grief had dulled with time but remained grief nonetheless ive always been glad they had those two days alone together first jordan let the silence drift a moment he began to see why she had understood alison so quickly you lived with your grandfather afterward yes after the first year what happened the first year kasey hesitated she hadnt meant to go into all of this but the lack of demand in his questions had eased the telling with a shrug she continued i had an aunt my fathers sister she was a good deal older than he ten fifteen years i think you lived with her the first year i lived between her and my grandfather that year there was a dispute over custody my aunt objected to a wyatt living in the wilderness that was how she termed my grandfathers home she was from georgetown in dc a memory stirred was your father robert wyatt yes jordan was silent as he let bits and pieces fall into order the wyatts of georgetown an old established family money and politics samuel wyatt would have been her paternal grandfather hed made his fortune in banking then had gone on to become a top presidential advisor robert wyatt had been the youngest son two older brothers had found a place in the senate the sister would be alice wyatt longstream congressional wife and political hostess a very wealthy very conservative family as he remembered there had been talk of grooming the youngest son for the top office in washington hed been a brilliant young lawyer there had been a great deal of press when he was killed and his wife jordan frowned as he tried to remember things he had read and heard seventeen years before his wife had been an attorney as well they had opened a law clinic together something his family had not wholeheartedly approved of i remember reading about the accident jordan murmured then a bit now and again about the custody suit my mother and father discussed it occasionally shes acquainted with your aunt there was a good deal of publicity of course kasey lifted a shoulder wealthy political family squabbles with backwoods country doctor over child what makes better press jordan heard the hint of bitterness slip into the careless words tell me about it kasey whats there to tell she would have risen then but his arm kept her beside him his hold was gentle but firm custody suits are ugly and hideous for the child caught in the middle both your parents were lawyers jordan put in surely they had clearly defined wills giving you a legal guardian of course they did my grandfather kasey shook her head how was he able to pull so much out of her with only a few words she never discussed this part of her life with anyone wills can be contested particularly if you have a great deal of money and a great deal of power she wanted me not for me but because my name was wyatt i understood that even when i was eight years old it wasnt difficult she had never approved of my mother my parents met while they were in law school it was one of those instant attractions they were married within two weeks my aunt never forgave him for marrying an unknown law student who was only at georgetown university because of a scholarship you said you lived between your grandfather and aunt the first year what did you mean jordan this was all very long ago kasey he interrupted her turning her face to his talk to me she settled back in his shoulder again and shut her eyes the tension was back in her muscles when my aunt filed suit things began to get ugly there were reporters they came to school to my grandfathers house my aunt hired a firm of detectives to prove he wasnt caring for me properly in any case i was having a difficult time dealing with it my grandfather thought it might be easier for me if i lived with my aunt for a while it would take some of the pressure off and i might find that i wanted to live with her at the time i hated him for sending me away i thought he didnt want me i didnt stop to think that it was the hardest thing hed ever done i was all he had left of my mother jordan watched her run her thumb over the gold band she wore my aunt had a beautiful row house in georgetown thirtyfifth street it had high ceilings and fireplaces in every room fabulous antiques and sevres china she had a collection of porcelain dolls and a black butler she called lawrence kasey started to rise again she needed to move no jordan kept her against him sit he knew that if she stood shed find a way to avoid telling him any more what happened she bought me organdy dresses and mary janes and paraded me around i was enrolled in a private school and given piano lessons it was the most miserable time in my life i hadnt gotten over my parents death yet and my aunt was far from maternal she wanted a symbol a nice quiet child she could dress up and show to her friends my uncle was away most of the time he was nice enough i suppose but selfabsorbed or perhaps thats not fair he had a great deal of responsibility neither of them could give me what i needed and i couldnt give them what they were looking for i asked obnoxious questions he laughed a little and kissed her temple ill bet you did she wanted to mold me and i refused to be molded its really that simple i was surrounded by beautiful things i wasnt supposed to touch fascinating people came to the house whom i wasnt supposed to speak to except to answer yes sir or no maam when i was addressed it was like being caged your aunt dropped the suit it took her three months to realize she couldnt live with me she told me if there was any wyatt in me it was wellhidden and sent me back to my grandfather it was like being able to breathe again jordan frowned out over the lawn from where they sat he could just see the top story of the house is she feeling caged here he remembered the way she had walked from window to window in the drawing room he wanted a little time to digest the things he had just learned about her youre very close to your grandfather he murmured he was my anchor when i was growing up and my kite she smiled and plucked at a blade of grass hes a caring intelligent man who can argue three viewpoints at once and believe all of them he knows me accepts me for what i am and loves me anyway she brought her knees up and again rested her forehead on them hes seventy and i havent been home in nearly a year in three weeks itll be christmas therell be snow and someone will give him a tree in lieu of payment his patients will be flooding into the house all day bringing him everything from homebaked bread to homebrewed whiskey shes thinking of leaving he realized and felt a quick unexpected panic he watched the sun filter through the leaves and fall on her hair not yet he thought not yet kasey he touched her hair ive no right to ask you to stay stay anyway she gave a rippling sigh for how much longer she wondered i should go home until i recover from this from him kasey lifted her head prepared to say what she felt had to be said jordans eyes were on her they were clear and seeking he wouldnt ask her again he wouldnt insist kasey realized he didnt have to his silence his eyes were doing it for him hold me she murmured and held her arms out to him there would be no leaving him she thought as she pressed against him not until she no longer had a choice she had opened herself to him offered she couldnt take herself back now then he was kissing her softly without demand hed not been this gentle before holding her as if she were something fragile no there would be no leaving him now kaseys heart had more power over her life than her intellect where she loved she was vulnerable and where she was vulnerable her mind had no sway she pulled him closer the kiss grew deep still tender but intimate and weakening his hand went to her cheek to stroke her skin it was soft so soft and had needs hammering inside him he murmured her name and traced his lips down to her throat there was warmth there and a taste he had grown to crave how was it she could give him so much and ask for nothing but there was something he could give her give both of them kasey i have to go to new york this weekend some business with my publisher he didnt add that he had been putting the trip off for weeks come with me new york her brows came together you havent said anything before no it depended on the progress of the book kasey he kissed her again he didnt want her to ask questions come with me i want some time with you alone i want more than a few hours at night i want to sleep with you i want to wake up with you she wanted it too to be with him away from the house to be able to spend the night with him in complete freedom kasey could feel some of the weight beginning to lift what about alison as it happens she asked me just this afternoon if she could spend the weekend with a school friend jordan smiled and brushed a curl from kaseys cheek lets consider it fate kasey and take advantage of it fate her lips curved into a smile and jordan watched as it finally reached her eyes im a very strong believer in fate chapter contents prev next new york the plane had landed in a miserable sleeting rain that was rapidly turning to snow the streets were a sloshy slippery mess packed tight with cars the sidewalks were crowded with people hurrying nothing could have delighted kasey more new yorkers she mused were always hurrying she loved them for it and there wasnt a city she knew that appreciated the christmas season more everywhere she looked there were decorations trees lights and glittering tinsel and there were santa clauses everywhere she had tried to draw it all in on the cab ride from the airport to the hotel now in the bedroom of the suite she would share with jordan she pressed her nose to the window glass and continued to look there were lights and people and the muffled hum of traffic it struck her how completely she had been starved for the sights and smells of humanity she had needed the noise and the motion jordan hadnt expected her to have this sort of enthusiasm for the city from what she had told him of her childhood he had thought she would prefer a rural setting but she hadnt been able to see enough she had been bubbling over in the taxi pointing at this laughing at that anyone would have taken her for a firsttime visitor but he knew she had spent several weeks in manhattan in early fall you act as though youd never been here before he commented she turned to smile at him the glow was there again he could almost forget the unhappiness he had seen in her eyes only a few days before its a wonderful place isnt it so many people so much life and its snowing i dont know if i could have made it through december without seeing snow is that why you came he crossed to her to run a hand through her hair to see snow naturally she lifted her face to brush his mouth with hers i cant think of any other reason can you one or two occur to me he murmured she slipped out of his arms to wander around the room nice place she commented and ran a finger over the dresser top the faint smell of rich polish hung in the air not my usual working conditions were not working she looked back at him over her shoulder no a party a few meetings he came to her again and turned her to face him fully i could have skipped the party and handled the meetings by phone if work had been the only purpose of our trip jordan i know you did this for me she covered his hands with hers im grateful i did it for me too he drew her into his arms what was she doing to him he had known her two months and she was rapidly becoming the most important thing in his life are we really alone she murmured she felt the relief wash through her god are we really alone alone he agreed and lured her mouth to his how soon is that party she pushed the jacket from his shoulders and began to work on his shirt an hour or so his hands slipped up under her sweater tell me she nipped at his lip and felt his shudder of response do you consider being late rude or fashionable rude he ran his fingers down to unbuckle the thin belt she wore very rude lets be rude jordan she opened his shirt and sighed when her hands slid around him lets be terribly rude when they were naked on the bed he took his time they had time now for slow loving kasey slipped into a cloud of pleasure where he touched she heated where he kissed she ached he was careful to keep his hands gentle remembering the bruises he had given her before her strength her drive made it difficult to remember her fragility her skin was smooth and pale with barely a trace of a tan line though she spent many of her free hours outdoors she didnt tan easily he could see the contrast of the bronzed color of his hand against the milky whiteness of her breast he took his mouth to it and heard her moan she was more responsive than any woman he had known there were no inhibitions in her she loved freely very gently he caught her nipple between his teeth and felt her arch beneath him as she catapulted from contentment into passion he used his tongue to kept her trembling until she was breathless and spent her fingers dug into his shoulders her murmurs urged him to hurry but he moved without rush to her other breast jordan she could barely speak for waves of need were pressing down on her i want you now too soon he trailed his lips down her ribcage much too soon his mouth roamed and she continued to shudder he slipped his fingers inside her taking her to a violent peak delirium kasey knew she had passed all reason pleasure could give no more passion could take no more from her yet he continued to drive her every cell of her body was alive humming she was nearly panicked to have him and clutched at him willing him to be as desperate as she his hands seared over her and had her quivering then his mouth was on hers again hungry urgent he took it to her throat with his teeth digging into her skin he had forgotten his vow to be gentle he had forgotten everything but the feel of her thin agile body beneath his and his own desperation need sparked need and he was inside her there was no longer time for slow loving jordan decided he didnt get used to kasey as time passed but only became more intrigued by her the elegant coop overlooking central park was crowded with members of the book world writers editors literary agents and scions of publishing but she was the vortex of it other women glittered in jewels diamonds sapphires emeralds she required none she sat on the arm of a chair sipping champagne and laughing with simon germaine the head of one of the top publishing houses in the country j r richards hung over her shoulder he was on his fourth in a string of bestselling novels each of which had made the transition to the screen successfully beside her was agnes greenfield one of the toughest agents in the business she had represented jordan for ten years and he decided this was the first time he had seen her grin shed smiled sneered and snarled but never grinned as he watched kasey laid a hand on germaines shoulder and said something that made him throw back his head and roar kaseys eyes lifted and found jordans through the crowd she smiled slowly as she brought up her glass for another sip a shaft of desire shot straight through him nearly settling him back on his heels how does she do it he demanded of himself how can she make me want her when im still warm from having her when am i going to get enough he pushed the questions aside and wondered how long it would be before they could slip away and he could have her to himself again the widening schism between elitist and popular literature has made it difficult for the average person to enjoy light entertaining reading without feeling guilty kasey lifted her brow at jr as jordan approached ive read all of your books and my conscience is clear she sipped her champagne and smiled at jordan it took jr a moment before he began to chuckle i think ive just been put in my place im tempted to begin collaborating jordan if i can find a partner like this ive been trying to convince kasey to write a book of her own germaine gulped down his straight scotch without a blink he had a wide florid face and a stonegray moustache above his lip kasey thought he looked a bit like a childrens tv show host she remembered from her own girlhood i appreciate that simon kasey pushed her curls behind her ears and crossed her legs but ive always felt that being a writer meant being frugal with words im very lavish with mine you tell a hell of a story kasey he patted her knee companionably and she caught jordans lifted brow ive got editors to deal with the excess and im temperamental kasey finished off her champagne and was immediately handed a fresh glass thanks she gave jr a friendly smile what writer isnt germaine huffed and pulled out a thick cigar are you temperamental jordan periodically im difficult to work with all the time which at least makes me predictable kasey put in the one thing ive found you are not is predictable jordan lifted his own champagne the perfect compliment jordan theres some fantastic looking caviar over there i wouldnt feel right if i didnt stuff myself they moved across the room to a sumptuously prepared buffet he watched kasey heap beluga caviar on a thin cracker you and germaine seem to have hit it off nicely hes sweet kasey said with her mouth full she was already reaching for another cracker god im starving do you realize what time it is according to west coast time did we eat on the plane i can never remember anything that happens at thirty thousand feet sweet jordan repeated ignoring the rest the adjective applied to germaine was enough to arrest his attention i dont believe ive ever heard him described quite that way before oh ive heard the stories kasey began to forage for something else and found a bowl of iced cocktail shrimp heaven she muttered spearing one with a toothpick hes supposed to be tough as old leather and mean as a starved dog what is this she pointed toward another platter beef tongue well just skip over that she decided she helped herself to another shrimp i like him apparently the feelings mutual kasey smiled and paused long enough to drink some champagne your sensibilities were offended when he put his hand on my knee youre terribly cute when youre reserved and conventional jordan would it embarrass you terribly if i kissed you right now she was baiting him and he knew it firmly he put his hand behind her neck and pulled her close her eyes laughed at him before he gave her a long hard kiss she carried the strong exotic flavors of the buffet when he drew her away she was still smiling caviars good huh it seems i have a taste for it she turned and piled another cracker high have some more she invited with a grin i cant ever get enough of it myself he took a bite of the cracker she held up to his mouth i want you out of here he told her quietly i want you alone where i can take those clothes off you piece by piece an interesting proposition kasey murmured touching a finger to his tie am i allowed to do the same to you required jordan a woman glided up to them sturdy fortyish and unashamedly blond and busty kasey flipped through her memory file and drew out a newspaper picture of serena newport highly successful novelist who wrote books stacked with swashbuckle and sex serena kissed jordan heartily on both cheeks you dont show up at these things often enough she complained i like to be seen with classy men serena its good to see you and whos this she gave kasey a strong look good god thin as a rail and positively stunning if i stand here for too long ill wind up looking like an albino elephant are you a writer dear and who colors your hair a fan miss newport and i was born with it god its disgusting she put her hand on an ample hip and shook her head not the fan part dear the hair born with it dreadfully unfair and whose fan are you jordans or mine both kasey was liking her more with each passing minute serena laughed in one short boom thats unusual not too many people read both last abstinence and passions victory do they jordan kaseys unusual serena serena newport kathleen wyatt and what do you do i know she held up a hand before kasey could speak dont tell me you model model what kasey asked enjoying herself clothes no an actress she stated changing her mind thats a very expressive face thank you but i dont act professionally only in daytoday encounters quick too serena murmured youre not an agent trying to lure jordan away from agnes not if i value my life kasey replied well my dear im fascinated and totally baffled serena hailed a passing waiter and grabbed a glass of champagne there were chunks of precious stones on her fingers and her nails were a brilliant red what are you im an anthropologist youre joking serena looked at jordan for confirmation is she joking you wouldnt ask if you questioned her on the tribal rituals of the sioux jordan replied and finished off his drink you dont say serena drew out the words kaseys collaborating with me on a book hmm serena took a healthy swallow of champagne you dont happen to know anything interesting about the algonquins do you dear originally a north american tribe who were dispersed by the iroquois in the seventeenth century most found new settlements in quebec and ontario kasey countered fate serena exclaimed and grabbed kaseys arm do you believe in fate dear kasey shot a look at jordan and grinned as a matter of fact i do ive just started a new book the first half is in england but the second half has my nowpenniless aristocrat off to the colonies hes halfstarved and all but beaten to death when he comes upon a party of algonquins they wouldnt have scalped him or anything dreadful like that would they kasey grinned many of the algonquins were friendly to white settlers for some time it depends upon which tribe you are talking about however perfect wonderful serena folded kaseys arm through her thick one im stealing her for an hour jordan its too good to miss have some more champagne she gave his cheek a motherly pat ill send her back to you when im done kasey looked over her shoulder and shrugged as she was propelled away its the first time kasey said later that ive met anyone who can outtalk me she leaned against the back seat of the cab tucked into the curve of jordans arm im suitably humbled i gave serious consideration to strangling her after the first hour she was close and the scent of her hair wafted over him she was warm and a little sleepy a little high on champagne he wanted her she drilled you for two hours and ten minutes kasey laughed softly shes a marvelous person ive always thought so until tonight shes very fond of you kasey smiled up at him she told me you were a wonderful writer a marvelous man particularly when you forget to be polite she laughed at his lifted brow i had to agree with her if serenas books are a barometer she prefers a more earthy type oh jordan i just love it when youre dignified she took a nip at his ear why dont you kiss me again the way you did at the party sort of macho and domineering damn you kasey he was laughing as he pressed his lips to hers mmm swear at me and im yours she murmured be careful he warned finding his hunger growing despite her teasing i ran out of patience an hour ago kasey laughed again and laid her spinning head on his shoulder and he burned for her burned with a whitehot heat that only she could satisfy she sighed and snuggled serena newport chesterfields woman she was more than high on champagne jordan realized she was threequarters drunk kasey youre smashed he said amused well put she agreed you writers have a way with words she lifted her mouth to just beneath his are you going to take advantage of my condition absolutely oh good she wrapped her arms around his neck start now the cab pulled over to the curb and jordan untangled himself why dont i pay off the cab first details kasey stepped onto the sidewalk with the help of the doorman the cold air still smelling of snow whipped over her cheeks it did nothing to clear her head jordan she tucked her arm into his when he joined her its just occurred to me something you said in the cab about serenas barometer does that mean you read her books of course i read her books he steered kasey through the doors and across the lobby does that surprise you i stand astonished its astonishing that you can stand at all he countered pressing the button for the elevator but jordan i have a difficult time picturing you reading chesterfields woman kasey allowed herself to be drawn inside the elevator why he pushed the button for their floor then pulled kasey into his arms to quote germaine she tells a hell of a story then he was kissing her with a quick desperate hunger that had her rocking on her feet she would have been dizzy without the help of champagne the silk pressed cool against her skin as his hand ran down her back the heat kindled in her slowly until she was utterly pliant in his arms passion licked by wine simmered under his touch her mouth was soft under his and his tongue moved inside to seek hers her thighs throbbed with need and her head swam she was reeling and heating and floating all at once she could no longer cling to him but went limp in her first total surrender god kasey ive never known an elevator to take so long he buried his face in her hair and tried to draw back his own sanity she was so fluid so totally willing to have him love her he felt incredibly strong he hadnt known he would find even her weakness an excitement when it had been her strength that had drawn him to her the elevator door slid open and he guided her out into the hall jordan kasey turned to him again leaning against him with her face lifted to his her eyes were misted but the smile reached them what do you remember what chesterfield does to melanie in chapter eight right before the ship is attacked by the british frigate he grinned remembering very well yes as it happens i do why well she put her arms around his neck again i was wondering a purely academic thought if fiction could be translated to fact im thinking of doing a paper on the subject and youd like me to help you test your theory exactly she ran her hand through his hair would you mind in the interest of academia i might be persuaded he swept her into his arms didnt it start something like this he slipped the key into the lock and carried her inside chapter contents prev next she was still asleep when he woke jordan immediately felt her warmth and the light tickle of her hair on his shoulder the room was still dim with the heavy curtains drawn over the windows but a glance at his watch told him it was morning he had a meeting scheduled in just over an hour with a sigh he looked down at kasey hed never known anyone who slept so deeply he brushed the hair away from her forehead she didnt even stir he thought of how she had been the night before the sleepy sexuality the husky laugh the heavy eyes if he had been a fanciful man he would have thought her a witch there was something otherworldly about her every time he thought he had power over her he found himself caught in hers but now as she slept she might be any woman now she was just a woman sleeping off a night of champagne and loving so how was it he wondered that she still pulled at him as she slept she couldnt dispense her cockeyed charm or send out those looks that both invited and challenged him and yet he was drawn to her even as she lay there he lowered his mouth to hers jordan kept his lips gentle and kasey didnt stir he had wanted this to wake beside her to wake her her lips were so soft he felt he could sink into them he murmured her name and kissed her again her face was pale without makeup and there was a light sprinkling of freckles over her nose he kissed her cheek and his hand sought her breast she didnt wake didnt stir but sighed in sleep as though she dreamed of him he found the pulse in her throat with his lips and felt it beat slowly his own was already beginning to race he stroked gently feeling his passion build knowing the thrill of possession he ran his hand down the length of her the skin on the inside of her thighs was watersoft he moaned shattered by his need for her he took his mouth to her ear to her temple then back to hers to part her lips urgently her response was slow as he pulled her from the dream then her lips moved under his with a quiet moan her heart was suddenly pounding under his hand he entered her before she was fully awake spinning her into passion as delirious as his own she was curled against him again her arms tight her head resting in its favored spot in the curve of his shoulder she sighed and kissed where her lips could reach easily good morning she murmured she brought out something primitive in him which he wasnt certain he was comfortable with hed never experienced the degree of passion she could draw from him the laughter in her voice was irresistible good morning how do you feel mmm wonderful she snuggled closer and you fine but i wasnt teetering on my feet last night he shifted away just far enough to look at her her eyes were clear the dimple at the corner of her mouth appeared as her lips curved no hangover youre entitled to one i never have hangovers kasey kissed him lightly i refuse to believe in them she rolled over until she was leaning on his chest looking down at him do you realize how much trouble could be avoided if we simply didnt believe it an interesting theory i have dozens of them ive noticed he smiled and ran a finger down her cheek your theory last night was particularly interesting kasey laughed and dropped her forehead onto his chest it worked beautifully shall we tell serena she lifted her head again and her eyes were bright with humor i think not she kissed him again lingering do you remember i once told you that you had a terrific body yes i recall being surprised at the time but i didnt know you as well then she sighed as she felt his hands lower to her hips i still think so kasey rested her cheek on his chest there was a contentment in her she had never felt before you have meetings today dont you yes ive one in he lifted his arm to glance at his watch in about half an hour im going to be late if we were in fiji she murmured we could stay like this all day and you wouldnt need that watch if we were in fiji he countered you wouldnt have had your snow kasey sighed again and closed her eyes youre so logical jordan its one of the things i love most about you he said nothing for a moment she hadnt mentioned love to him since the first day she had confessed it he had wanted to hear it again so that he could explore his own reaction now he could feel her beginning to drift back to sleep i dont like to leave you alone he murmured therere a million people out there she yawned and snuggled down ill hardly be alone id rather be with you dont worry about me jordan im going to look for a sweatshirt and some jeans for alison something cheap and symbolic that she can grub around in for making mud sculptures he felt the smile tugging at his mouth again mmmhmm she smiled remembering the expression on his face the first day she and alison had made them and i want to see all the christmas decorations im going to have a lot more fun than you are can you break off from your busy schedule to meet me for lunch hmm maybe where where would you like he knew he should be up and dressing but he found it impossible to move rajah she said drowsily west fortyeighth street two oclock then okay did i bring my watch she asked him ive never seen you wear one i keep it in my purse so it doesnt intimidate me he kissed the top of her head i have to get up if i stay much longer ill have to make love with you again she lifted her face and her eyes were halfclosed promise he drew her back to him twenty minutes late agnes gave her watch a hard look thats not like you jordan sorry agnes he settled back in a leather chair agnes sat behind a sixfoot desk it was piled with manuscripts and memos jordan had always felt that sitting behind that desk she looked like a general waging battle well she saw the humor in his eyes and leaned back a pencil tapping on her lip i hope it was worth it jordan lifted a brow and said nothing agnes had expected nothing else she had never been able to bait him a very cool character she thought not for the first time she remembered the animated woman he had brought with him the night before an interesting combination about your collaborator agnes began pushing a few papers aside is she as good as you were led to believe better he told her she nodded then its money wellspent i want her to have a percentage of the royalties a percentage of the royalties agnes scowled and shifted in her chair you contracted her for a flat fee shes to have that as well jordan sat back and laced his fingers jordan the fee youre paying her is very generous her voice was patient your personal life is one thing but business is business this is business he countered jordans voice was patient too but firm agnes recognized the tone and stifled a sigh as well as being cool and cautious he was stubborn and she knew it i never expected when we wrote up the original agreement that id be able to draw so much out of her agnes the books nearly as much hers as it is mine shes entitled to benefit from it ethics agnes sighed you have such a sterling character jordan so do you agnes he smiled at her or you wouldnt be my agent agnes shrugged what percentage did you have in mind kasey fought her way through gimbels and loved every minute of it shed run into a sale and had three sweatshirts and two pairs of jeans tucked into her shopping bag shopping was something she did rarely but when she did she did it passionately she could spend three hundred dollars on a dress without a qualm and haggle furiously over a fivedollar sweater she pushed her way through the crowds and scrambled happily through racks of bargains as she shot from store to store passing a window she spied an inchhigh pewter unicorn and rushed inside to dicker over the asking price a pang of hunger reminded her of the time and she began to search through her purse for her watch sixtwentyseven she muttered frowning at it i dont think so she tossed it back into her purse and smiled at the clerk who was boxing her unicorn do you know what time it is onefifty he responded to the smile deciding she could make twenty blocks in ten minutes at an easy jog she took off without hailing a cab when she arrived at rajah her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were brilliant she passed through the elaborate entranceway and stepped inside the heat rushed to meet her it felt wonderful after the stinging cold and she pulled off her gloves to stuff them into her bag madam she turned her smile on the maitre d jordan taylor mr taylor just arrived he bowed in her direction this way please three hours of shopping and no breakfast had left her famished jordan watched her coming toward him and rose hi she kissed him then let him help her off with her coat you were serious about the shopping i see he commented glancing at the bag before she tucked it under the table deadly she agreed as she accepted a chair i bought you a present you can have it after i see the menu im starving some wine first he gave the order to the captain at his elbow while kasey buried her face behind the menu the crab goas always good and the barra kabab she put the menu down and grinned i think ill have both shopping gives me an appetite everything seems to jordan commented wryly he took her hand needing to touch her ive watched you eat its amazing he brought her hand to his lips did you really buy me a present yes its in the bag with alisons sweatshirts kasey reached down to forage and brought up the box you can open it if you promise to order immediately afterward agreed he lifted the top of the box and uncovered the unicorn its for luck kasey told him as the captain brought their wine you cant go wrong with a unicorn i almost bought you a bumper sticker with a lewd saying but i didnt think it would look quite right on your mercedes kasey touched he took her hand again youre outrageously sweet jordan tasted the wine and nodded to the captain the lady will have the crab goa and barra kabab ill have the fish curry how hungry are you she asked when the captain withdrew hungry enough why i was wondering if id get any of your fish she smiled when he laughed and slipped the small box into his pocket so you bought me a unicorn and alison sweatshirts did you buy anything for yourself no she tossed her hair out of her eyes then settled her elbows on the table and cradled her chin on her hands there were some earrings in the shop where i got the unicorn flashy little drops in scrolled gold but they wouldnt bargain with me i was in the bargaining mood and i got hungry she grinned and reached for her wine how was your meeting fine he had debated discussing the royalties with her and had decided against it she might object citing agness argument about the original agreement and in any case he didnt want business to intrude on their time together they had only one night left ive another one at four with germaine hell probably ask me to use my influence to talk you into writing that book kasey laughed and shook her head i think the writings safer in your hands but give him my best what would you like to do tonight a basket of bread was placed before them and kasey dove into it immediately would you like to see a play mmm a musical she buttered the bread lavishly and offered him some jordan shook his head smiling as she took a hefty bite something with a lot of flash and a happy ending ill meet you back at the hotel at six kasey nodded then reached for more bread okay narrowing her eyes she calculated the time between six and curtain she smiled over the rim of her glass wed better plan on having a late supper kasey was dreaming it was a familiar dream too familiar and her mind struggled to reject it before it took hold she was alone abruptly dropped down into a pure white sea in a small boat she knew what would happen next and tried to push the image aside but she wasnt strong enough the boat began to rock as the wind picked up but she had no sail no oars to guide herself the water stretched as far as she could see there would be no swimming for land she was lost and alone and afraid she was only a child when she saw the ship coming toward her she shouted for it steeped in relief her grandfather was at the helm and raising a hand he tossed out a life line before she could reach it another ship floated up to her right the wake of the two ships set her small boat rocking dangerously water hurled into her face and was soon ankledeep on the deck she was caught in the middle as each ship tried to draw her aboard she couldnt reach her grandfathers life line the waves were knocking her around the boat until she screamed in frustration and begged him to come for her he shook his head and drew the line away she was sucked closer to the second ship and the waves grew high until they tossed her into the sea water closed over her head cutting off her air her light no she shot straight up in bed covering her face with her hands kasey her cry had roused jordan from sleep he reached for her and found her cold and quivering what is it whats wrong just a dream she fought for control im all right its nothing her voice was shaking as desperately as her body and though she resisted he pulled her closer youre not all right youre like ice hold onto me she wanted to do as he said but was afraid already she depended on him too much shed handled the dream alone before she would handle it again no im all right her voice sharpened as she pulled out of his arms she struggled out of bed and drew on her robe when jordan switched on the bedside lamp she began to hunt for her cigarettes he watched her as he reached for his own robe there was no color in her face and her eyes were dark with fright she was shaking from head to foot and her breath was still trembling finding her cigarettes she fumbled to pull one out im a scientist i know what a dream is she covered her mouth with her hand a moment hearing the jerkiness of her own voice her teeth were chattering a sequence of sensations images or thoughts passing through a sleeping persons mind its not real she picked up jordans lighter but her hand shook and she couldnt work it quietly he crossed to her taking the cigarette and lighter from her hand he set them back on the table kasey he put his hands on her shoulders feeling her shudder convulsively under his palms stop this let me help you ill be all right in a minute she stiffened when he drew her close again jordan please i cant stand to fall apart this way i hate it do you have to handle everything by yourself he was stroking her back trying to warm her does needing comfort make you weak if i needed to be held would you turn away from me kasey let me help you with a sob she was clinging to him her face pressed against his throat oh jordan it frightens me as much as it did the first time without speaking he picked her up and carried her back to bed keeping his arm tight around her he drew her against his side youve had it before since i was a child her voice was muffled against his chest he could feel the racing of her heart i dont have it often anymore sometimes years she closed her eyes and tried to steady her breathing when i have it its always the same always so vivid her trembling had lessened but he kept her tight in the circle of his arms she was bringing out something new in him the need to protect tell me about it she shook her head its just foolish tell me anyway she was quiet a moment then with a sigh she began her description was short and her words were unemotional but he could sense the feeling beneath them it was childishly simple to understand but then it had been the dream of a child i never told my grandfather about it she went on i knew it would upset him i only had the dream twice the whole time i was in college her voice had grown steadier and her hold on jordan less desperate i had it once when i read a rehash of the custody case by some enterprising reporter whod picked up on it when one of my uncles had been running for reelection and again the night before graduation id put that down to too much beer and the pressure of delivering the valedictorian address she sighed now and felt her body relax and since then he had felt the fear and tension pour out of her her body was warming a couple of times once when pop was in the hospital with pneumonia it scared me to death hes always bursting with health once on a dig wed had to shoot a rabid dog it broke my heart she felt safe and grew sleepy again now shed given him her trust as well as her love she was content for the moment to be cared for that was two years ago i dont know what set me off tonight he heard her voice thickening and said nothing shell sleep now he thought and stared up at the ceiling he wouldnt his mind was too crowded with kasey wyatt when he had first met her he had thought her a tough eccentric with a great deal of charisma now he realized there was far more to her than that her breathing was even now and quiet tomorrow they would return to palm springs and complete their work on the book in another few weeks kasey would be finished with her work then it would be up to him reaching beside him jordan found his cigars and matches he lit one and smoked in silence while he listened to kasey breathing deeply in sleep chapter contents prev next in two weeks it would be christmas kasey could feel the time rushing by her the brief interlude in new york had done much to settle her she felt in control again of her nerves of her situation what she had with jordan she was able to accept again without all the doubts and discomfort which had been piling up she loved him needed to be with him when the time came to pay the price shed pay it still she wished time wouldnt move so fast for alisons sake she would have liked christmas to come quickly but for her own she could wait she would have drawn out each day each hour after christmas would come the new year with the new year would come the time for her to go watching the childs simple pleasure helped to keep kaseys mind off herself for two short weeks she could spend her free time making the holiday come alive for the girl the elegant red garland and silver bells that kasey had seen the staff unpacking werent really christmas she had spent one stiff formal christmas in her life that was enough for her jordan kasey dashed down the stairs and burst into jordans study youve got to see this come upstairs she was pulling on his arm and laughing kasey im in the middle of something here put it down she ordered you work too hard she leaned over and gave him a quick hard kiss its really terrific youre going to love it she promised come on jordan you can be back at work before your typewriter knows youre gone she was difficult to refuse under any circumstances but when she was pulling on his arm and laughing like this it was impossible all right he rose and allowed her to drag him toward the stairs what is it a surprise of course im crazy about surprises upstairs she pushed open the door to her room and motioned for him to enter he did then studied the room in silence red and green paper chains hung everywhere crisscrossing and draping from wall to wall they wound down the bedposts and framed the windows cardboard angels santas and elves hung from doorknobs and balanced on dresser tops and a red felt stocking overflowed with candy canes there was a bright gold star suspended from the center of the ceiling jordan took a turn around and faced kasey again redecorating i didnt do it she rose on her toes and kissed him again he delighted her when he used that dry tone alison did isnt it wonderful i can certainly say im surprised shaking his head he looked around again and i can honestly say ive never seen anything quite like it you should see the bathroom kasey told him its spectacular he smiled at kasey and sent an elf spinning on its string and of course you told her you loved it i do love it kasey countered its one of the nicest things anyones ever done for me she wanted me to feel at home for christmas and now i do jordan reached out to touch her hair if i had known paper chains would make you happy id have made some myself kasey grinned and threw her arms around him do you know how i think i could manage it can you string popcorn can i what he was distracted from kissing her hair string popcorn kasey repeated linking her hands around his neck what id really like to do on christmas eve is string popcorn for the tree and i want to get alison a puppy wait a minute jordan drew her away sometimes it takes me just a minute to catch up just say yes to both and think of the trouble well save i cant bear a tree without popcorn strings jordan its positively naked and alison needs a puppy why why what jordan sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger how did she manage to do this so often why does alison need a puppy because she wants one first of all thats a good reason she smiled at him and a puppy would be a companion and a responsibility for her what do you think about cocker spaniels jordan leaned back against the door im forced to admit ive never given them much thought give it a minute then she suggested its a gentle breed good with children a pet is very important in childhood jordan owning one teaches a variety of valuable wait jordan held up a hand to stop her it would be simpler if i just said yes and saved us both a lot of time i told you that you were logical kasey smiled pleased with herself jordan put his hands on her shoulders i also think its very thoughtful of you so do i she said lightly im a very thoughtful person you are he said and drew her closer whether you like to hear it or not youve made quite a difference in alisons life and in mine she couldnt speak but only laid her head on his chest i love you both she thought and shut her eyes tight does this mean yes to the popcorn too she asked him it was so warm in his arms so secure it was impossible to believe that one day soon shed have to leave them i dont suppose i could face a naked christmas tree she squeezed him thank you now ive something to ask you she tilted her face back to his and smiled your timings exceptional she decided im obliged to say yes to almost anything he kissed her nose perhaps youll remember that at a more opportune time but for now youve probably noticed my mother doing quite a bit of sighing because i havent attended any of the holiday parties as a matter of fact i have kasey kept her voice light ive also noticed she said how expertly you ignore her ive had a lifetime of practice jordan said dryly but theres a club dance at the end of the week i should go come with me are you asking me for a date jordan it sounded like it he laughed suddenly and shook his head kasey you make me feel as though i were sixteen will you come with me i like to dance she slid her hands up behind his neck and linked them id like to dance with you she gave him a kiss and let it slowly deepen until she heard his quiet sound of pleasure i believe ill buy a new dress she murmured do you have a favorite color green his mouth roamed to her neck like your eyes she laughed a little and pressed closer jordan theres one more thing i should tell you hmm what his mouth was back on hers alison kasey began accepting the kiss when she finished in here she went to do your room do what he murmured steeped in kaseys taste your room my room jordan drew away a bit to look at her my room he glanced over her head at the paper chains and cardboard figures incredulity spread over his face as he looked back at kasey my room jordan youre repeating yourself kasey laughed as he let out a long breath slipping her arms around his waist she hugged him tightly youre going to love it she promised youre getting a foam snowman the next afternoon kasey looked on as alison strummed her guitar the technique was still clumsy but she made up for it with enthusiasm kasey thought back to the first time she had watched alison sit stiffly at the piano playing brahms with precision and disinterest no more empty eyes she thought and reached out to touch the girls hair what would it be like to have a child of her own she wondered she shook her head she was becoming too sentimental and much much too attached terrific she told alison when she had finished you learn quickly will i ever play as well as you better soon kasey smiled and packed the guitar in its case ive an affection for music youve affection and skill i didnt think so before alison sat down at the piano and began to finger the keys i can play things on the piano and the guitar now kasey grinned alison i have to go shopping want to come with me shopping alisons attention was arrested christmas shopping ive finished mine but id like to help you with what you have left have left i havent started yet none at all alisons eyes widened but there are only ten days left that many kasey rose and stretched well i suppose i can start early i usually wait until christmas eve i love the confusion but what if you cant find what you want how like jordan she was kasey thought thats the challenge kasey told her i drive the sales clerks crazy the thought made her grin in any case i need a dress we can grab a hamburger too there must be a mcfardens around somewhere mcfardens alison brought her brows together she was intrigued and cautious so like jordan kasey thought again ive never been to mcfardens never been to mcfardens kasey gave her a look of exaggerated astonishment that she said is positively unamerican grabbing alisons hand she pulled her to her feet you need a lesson in patriotism some time later kasey eased into a parking space i told you id find one switching off the ignition she dropped the keys into her pocket alison climbed out and kasey locked up carefully i hope uncle jordan wont mind that we borrowed his car he told me i could use it whenever i liked kasey skirted around the mercedess hood but charles usually drives everyone except uncle jordan why should we drag poor charles around kasey countered we must have gone to a hundred and thirtyseven stores she pushed through the glass doors im starving do you realize how long its been since i had a hamburger alison looked around her and became caught up in the crowd and the noise it smells wonderful kasey laughed and pulled her into line smellings not eating i have a craving for french fries alison stared up at the menu that hung above the counter and zeroed in on a picture of a hamburger id like one of those is it good fantastic kasey laughed you have big eyes alison lets hope you have an appetite to match it is big alison stated when they found a table she took a bite and grinned and its good you have very discerning taste kasey dug into her own she closed her eyes and sighed its been too long do you think we can talk francois into trying his hand at one of these you could alison stated and wolfed down a french fry why do you say that you could talk anybody into anything kasey laughed and shook her head perceptive little squirt arent you alison grinned and sampled her milk shake ive never seen anything like the present you got for uncle jordan the shamans rattle kasey chewed thoughtfully on a french fry it was quite a find it had been elegantly carved and painted apache kasey had been thrilled enough to come across it that she hadnt even thought to bargain itll help him ward off evil spirits alison was bulldozing her way through the hamburger i liked the dress you bought too green looks beautiful on you i dont usually wear it its so obvious with my coloring she sat back with her own milk shake then i dont mind being obvious now and again its very stylish alison told her and took another bite of her hamburger and slinky kasey grinned i did like that other one though you know the smashed velvet crushed velvet alison corrected and giggled whatever would you like an apple pie alison sat back and took a deep breath i dont think so would you not if i want to get into that dress what did you get me for christmas its a kasey alison exclaimed i thought i might catch you off guard its supposed to be a secret alison wiped her hands primly telling would spoil it really kasey gave her a guileless smile is that why youve been creeping around the house and searching through closets alison blushed then giggled again i only thought i might shake some boxes thats an old story christmas is more fun with you here kasey her eyes were serious again will you stay forever kasey felt the first crack in her heart how could she explain to the girl what she didnt want to think of herself forever is a long time alison she kept her voice quiet and her eyes level ill have to leave when my jobs finished but cant you stay and keep working for uncle jordan he doesnt need a resident anthropologist alison and ive work of my own she watched the childs gaze falter and drop friends stay friends alison no matter how far apart they are i love you she reached out to lay her hand over alisons thats not going to change will you come back alison lifted her eyes again and visit me i cant she wanted to say how can you ask me cant you understand how it would hurt me you could visit me she said instead would you like that really alisons smile bloomed again and your grandfather sure pop would love it she began to pile things back on the tray youre much better behaved than i ever was why dont you dump all this stuff in the trash kasey took a moment when she was alone at the table to pull herself together it was better this way alison was already being prepared and what about me she shut her eyes a moment ive said ill pay the price when the time comes i have to stick to that ready she said and gave alison a smile when she came back to the table now we have to find a post office so i can mail off those things to my grandfather do you think hell like that little gnome with the buck teeth when they entered the house alison was laughing struggling to balance her share of kaseys purchases ill help you wrap them she said grabbing at a sliding box wed better get them upstairs first kasey rescued the box and glanced up as beatrice came down the stairs alison what have you been doing she frowned at the childs windblown hair alison helped me with my christmas shopping mrs taylor beatrice shifted her gaze and met kaseys eyes i dont approve of you taking alison from the house without discussing it with me first she turned to her granddaughter again go up and brush your hair alison you look a sight yes maam kasey watched her walk obediently up the stairs she turned back to beatrice and spoke calmly im sorry if you were concerned mrs taylor you were out when we left and i did tell millicent what our plans were beatrice lifted a brow i dislike being informed by a servant of the whereabouts of my grandchild it didnt occur to me youd notice she wasnt here beatrices color flared are you criticizing me miss wyatt of course not mrs taylor kasey fought to keep the conversation in perspective i enjoy alisons company she enjoys mine we spent an afternoon together im sorry if you were worried i find your attitude impertinent i can only repeat im sorry kasey replied evenly now if youll excuse me id like to go put these things away youd be wise to remember your position in this house miss wyatt kasey stopped then set down her packages it seemed they werent through just yet youre a paid servant and can very easily be replaced im here on a job mrs taylor and no ones servant unless i choose to be she paused a moment is that all you have to say to me i wont tolerate your insubordination beatrices knuckles whitened on the post of the banister she wasnt accustomed to being looked at so directly by someone she considered an employee i wont tolerate your disruptive influence on my granddaughter i was under the impression that alison was jordans ward what am i doing kasey thought abruptly im putting alison right between us im putting her right in the middle mrs taylor she began searching for a way to ease the tension for the childs sake whats going on jordan came through the drawing room doorway hed heard the argument the moment hed stepped out of his study this woman his mother began turning to him is insufferably rude jordan lifted a brow kasey he asked turning to her probably she agreed and tried to relax her muscles miss wyatt took it upon herself to disappear with alison for the entire afternoon then had the effrontery to criticize me when i expressed concern jordan caught between amusement and annoyance studied kasey again been busy have you we only went christmas shopping uncle jordan alison came down half the stairs in a rush then stopped when her grandmother turned to her this is none of your concern alison go back up to your room i dont think thats necessary jordan stepped around his mother and held out a hand to alison she dashed down the rest of the stairs well you appear relatively unharmed did you have a good time it was wonderful alison grinned up at him we went to mcfardens really jordan shot a look at kasey he knew her well enough to see beyond the careless front she was raging inside and he thought curiously hurting what had been said he wondered before he had come upon them he smiled at her wanting to soothe her you might have asked me to go along kasey was working to control her temper she knew very well anger wasnt the way to handle beatrice taylor and handling beatrice taylor would be necessary if she wanted to keep things smooth for alison it helped to see alison standing under jordans arm you were working she returned and i didnt think the idea of tramping through shops would appeal to you kasey bought you a present uncle jordan did she he drew the child to his side but his eyes were on kaseys chocolate cookies kasey told him alison thought they were pretty obviously you intend to treat this matter lightly beatrice spoke again mother theres nothing here to be concerned about alisons fine very well she nodded then brushed by him to mount the stairs kasey looked down at alison who was watching her grandmothers retreating back im sorry uncle jordan i didnt know grandmother would be upset she wasnt here when we left and we told millicent in case you wondered where we were you havent done anything he bent and kissed her cheek your grandmothers probably a bit tired after her luncheon today thats all she needs to rest awhile why dont you take these packages up for kasey alison gathered up boxes ill bring wrapping paper to your room thanks children spring back quickly she noted alison was already more concerned with the presents than with her grandmothers annoyance jordan put his hands on kaseys shoulders as alison disappeared up the steps shall i apologize too he asked quietly as he soothed the remaining tension from her muscles kasey shook her head no she sighed she was aware that it was beatrices dislike of her which had caused the confrontation she felt responsible ive put you in a bad position alison too i never meant to jordan let me handle my mother he told her ive been doing it for a long time and next time you go off for an afternoon he added invite me i might have found tramping through shops and a hamburger appealing all right she smiled steadying next time i will he started to pull her close then stopped his brows drew together chocolate cookies chapter contents prev next kasey paused in the drawing room doorway shed taken her time dressing for the dance at jordans club wanting to be certain beatrice was gone before she came downstairs standing there she had a moment to study jordan unobserved as he mixed drinks at the bar formal dress the stark black and white the perfect tailoring suited him he moves well she thought a man used to elegant clothes and elegant rooms yet theres so much more to him than i realized that first night i walked in here more depth more character more strength if i could have chosen a man to fall in love with i couldnt have chosen any better taking a deep breath she walked into the room it seems my timings perfect jordan turned to watch her the dress was dark green and clinging with a deep slash of a neckline it was caught at the side of her waist and fell straight leaving a slit that opened and closed as she walked i thought once you were a witch jordan murmured now im sure of it kasey took the glass from his hand like it she smiled and sipped jordan youve picked up the knack for mixing these you could make a living from it yes i like it he took the glass from her set it down and then drew her into his arms he gave her a long deep satisfying kiss that begged for more the thought comes into my mind he said as his lips grazed her cheekbone of locking those doors over there and staying right where i am oh no kasey smiled and shook her head you asked me for a date im holding you to it we could be late he kissed her again lingeringly they hadnt had nearly enough time together since they had returned from new york weve been late before but not here she thought floating under the kiss were not alone here she drew herself carefully out of his arms someone once told me that being late was rude besides she picked up her glass again you promised to dance with me i should think you dance very well it occurred to him that he wasnt going to like sharing her he shook off the notion jealousy was foreign to him all right he agreed a dates a date kasey took his hand as they walked to the door can we go parking afterward she asked love to he grinned and nudged her outside jordan slipped two glasses from the tray of a roving waiter champagne he asked her absolutely kasey took the glass and sipped its beautiful here im glad you asked me to come he touched the rim of his glass to hers to anthropology he murmured a fascinating science kasey gave a low laugh and raised her glass to her lips she turned to watch a slim brunette in a filmy white dress weave through the crowd toward them reaching jordan she rose on her toes to kiss his cheek jordan youve finally come out of hibernation hello liz you look lovely as always im surprised you remember what i look like after all this time its been months she smiled and turned to kasey she had round fawns eyes and creamy skin there was a single perfect diamond on a chain at her throat kathleen wyatt jordan touched kaseys shoulder lightly elizabeth bentley kathleen wyatt liz repeated the names very familiar but we havent met before have we no miss bentley we havent met kasey gave her a friendly smile appreciating the frank interest in her eyes would you like some champagne she asked slipping a glass from another tray its really very good thank you liz glanced down at the glass then back at kasey kaseys been working with me on my novel jordan explained he could see liz was both confused and intrigued oh yes a piece fell into place harry rhodes mentioned your name at dinner the other night she hesitated a moment he said you were extraordinarily intelligent thats because i hustled him at pool kaseys eyes gleamed with laughter over the rim of her glass as she lifted it again do you play play pool liz shook her head and a faint line of concentration appeared between her brows no youre an archaeologist no an anthropologist kasey smiled and couldnt resist an archaeologist is one who studies the life and culture of ancient peoples by excavating ancient cities relics artifacts an anthropologist is one who studies the races physical and mental characteristics distributions customs social relationships of mankind she took another sip of champagne thats a terrific dress she commented nodding at liz french you did a fine job of confusing liz jordan stated when he had kasey in his arms on the dance floor really kasey lifted her cheek from his she laughed at the wry look he gave her shes a very pretty lady jordan and a very nice one i like her you make up your mind quickly usually it saves time she smiled as he whirled her around the floor i decided you were a marvelous dancer she pointed out and i was right if i told you id never enjoyed a waltz more would you believe me i might she laughed up at him im going to have to let you dance with the men here who cant keep their eyes off you im not going to like it her brows lifted are there many she asked teasing him while she tried to sort out how she felt about his statement too many you walk into a room and every eye rests on you including mine kasey laughed and shook her head youve a writers imagination jordan and a mans he murmured i cant get you out of my mind she was staring up at him forgetting the music they moved to the people who moved with them do you want to he couldnt look away from her i dont know he couldnt think straight when she was in his arms pressed close i wish i did is it enough to tell you theres never been another woman whos been as important to me as you are it was a cautious step and kasey took it no further she touched his cheek with her fingers its enough jordan throughout the evening kasey was never alone she sparked interest everywhere she went she enjoyed answering the questions put to her and fielding flirtations she enjoyed the elegance the glamour just as she enjoyed a trip to the corner movie buttered popcorn or champagne it was all part of life miss wyatt kasey turned away from a discussion with a yachting enthusiast and his wife and smiled at harry rhodes hello harry its good to see you its nice seeing you again you look lovely so do you she touched the lapel of his dinner jacket he cleared his throat i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed reading the book you loaned me anytime harry he had a nice face she thought jordan was fortunate to have him for a friend ive been practicing you know im going to challenge you to another game of pool id like that she grinned now well have to try eight ball this time miss wyatt kathleen kasey he decided as her smile warmed for him thats what jordan calls you isnt it all my friends do he fiddled with his glasses and smiled his eyes were kind she thought like the wise little bear he reminded her of kasey i dont suppose youd care to risk the dance floor with a doddering old professor i dont see one kasey set down her glass and offered her hand but id love to dance with you harry jordans a very fortunate man to have found you he told her as they headed for the dance floor but it was you who found me wasnt it harry then i should pat myself on the back he liked the dimple at the corner of her mouth the way her hair curled without design around her face she seemed a little of the waif a little of the siren i hope jordan appreciates you hes a very kind man isnt he kind loving and gentle he loved his brother very much you know harry gave a sigh they were close allen his father was a dear friend of mine he died several years before and beatrice has never been a maternal woman best hostess i know he added but simply not cut for mothering the boys were quite a pair a bit wild now and then but wild kasey interrupted with a surprised laugh jordan he had his moments my dear recalling a few harry decided it would be more discreet not to detail them it was very difficult for jordan when he lost his brother they were twins i didnt know losing a brother would be hard enough she mused but losing a twin would be losing part of yourself hes never talked about it with me he closed himself in after that it hasnt been until recently that ive noticed the door opening again harry looked down at kasey thats your doing you care for him very much dont you kasey met his eyes directly im in love with him harry nodded he was no longer surprised by her frankness hes needed someone like you to snap the life back in him if hes not careful he could turn out to be a crusty old bachelor like me youre a beautiful man harry the music stopped and kasey kissed his cheek holding him a moment whats this jordan crossed over to them and slipped an arm around kaseys shoulders turn my back for a moment and youre nuzzling up to my date i thought i could trust you harry harry colored and harrumphed not with this lady my boy im part of the competition and i havent lost my touch yet he announced before he strolled away what did you do to him bemused jordan watched harrys swagger i believe he meant that i certainly hope so kasey drew jordans eyes back to her would you be jealous that would be a marvelous christmas present jordan its not christmas yet he countered lets go outside before i have to compete with someone else competitions very healthy kasey stated as they slipped through the terrace doors in studies with white mice he kissed her firmly cutting off the impending lecture im damned if im going to compete with white mice he muttered pulling her closer his hand was in her hair and his mouth demanded kasey yielded sensing it was what he needed her mouth was soft and her arms lifted to wind around his neck a submission of the moment later there would be time for challenge for aggression for equal strength he needed something different from her now it was simple to surrender to him when she knew her own power she could feel his heart pound as he kept her molded against him jordan drew her away to stare down at her who are you he muttered i never know who you are youre closer to knowing than most she murmured and turned to lean on the rail its lovely here jordan the airs soft and i can smell verbena i think kasey lifted her face the stars are close she sighed and scanned them back at home i used to sit outside for hours and pick out constellations pop bought me a telescope one year i was going to be the first woman on the moon what changed your mind there was a click from his lighter then the scent of tobacco on the air kasey shrugged her shoulders she would remember that scent for the rest of her life i tried to live on dehydrated food for a week its terrible he laughed and she pointed skyward theres pegasus see he flies straight up andromedas head touches his wing she brought her hand down and sighed she felt pleasantly sleepy marvelous isnt it all the pictures up there its comforting knowing theyll be there tomorrow jordan came closer to touch her shoulder her skin was smooth and just a bit cool from the night air is that why you dig into the past because its a link with the future she gave another restless shrug maybe he tossed aside the cigar and pulled her close again she rested her head on his shoulder dance with me again jordan she murmured the nights almost over chapter contents prev next christmas eve magic kasey was ready for magic she had palm trees rather than snow but shed lived through christmases without snow before this time she had something of more value she would have the day with the man she loved and with a child who was burning with excitement that was magic enough for her she was aware that her job was finished or at least nearly so jordan spent more and more time working without her what she filled in now could be done by a letter or a simple phone call she was procrastinating and she knew whether jordan realized it or not that so was he the break had to come but not on christmas kasey was taking that for herself when the holidays were over shed make her plans pack then tell him in that order it would be better if everything was set before the words were said with a firm plan in mind kasey felt better she told herself she was entitled to a week the first of the year she would take the step away from him away from alison and begin again she was strong shed lived through losses before but now it was christmas and she had a family if only for another week she sat on the rug in the drawing room and watched alison poke at the stacks of presents under the tree she chattered like a magpie what might this be what that had to be how many hours were left not quite one less than the last time you asked jordan told her and pulled her up on his lap why dont we open everything now oh no uncle jordan we couldnt she glanced at kasey waiting to be overruled no we couldnt santa would be very annoyed alison laughed and snuggled into the curve of jordans arm kasey you know there isnt really a santa claus i know nothing of the sort you miss taylor are a cynic i am alison digested the word reaching over she picked up a small glass ball that held a miniature forest scene turning it upside down she let the snow fall i havent seen this before no jordan had wondered when she would notice it i found it in the attic this morning it was your fathers when we were boys really yes really i thought you might like to have it to keep she curled her fingers around the glass and looked up at him to keep alison looked back at the glass and watched the snow drift he liked the snow she mused when we lived in chicago we had snow fights hed let me win she leaned back against jordans chest and tilted the ball again kasey watched them and kept silent hed gone searching for that to give alison something of her father for christmas if she hadnt loved him before she would have fallen in love with him at that moment hes a good man she thought above everything else he is hes a good man she rose wanting to give them time alone kasey jordans eyes lifted to hers and she stopped i think i still have a few things to wrap she told him he smiled seeing through her didnt someone mention something about stringing popcorn popcorn alisons eyes lit up for the tree kasey told me a tree wasnt suitably dressed unless it wore popcorn jordan stated what do you think may we do it now im all for it but kasey seems to have something else to do jordan kept his eyes on her still smiling im flexible kasey returned then looked at alison well need several miles of string and three needles can you handle it are we going to eat some too absolutely alison scrambled up and taking the glass ball with her shot out of the room sometimes youre transparent kasey jordan rose and went to her you were going to cry and didnt want to do it in front of alison or in front of me that was a marvelous thing you did alison was with me last christmas and it never occurred to me he lifted kaseys chin a bit higher and kissed her dont make me cry jordan its christmas eve ive got them alison came to the doorway at a full run she held up a packet of needles and a thick ball of string half the battle kasey crossed to her then turned back to jordan coming i wouldnt miss it as they approached the kitchen door jordan said you know im not sure how francois is going to take this his kitchens sacred piece of cake kasey murmured as they entered francois turned and bowed he didnt wear the white hat kasey had hoped for all those weeks ago but he did have the moustache monsieur he bowed at jordan may i assist you francois jordan took a moment hed witnessed more than one tantrum over the years we have a need to make something for the christmas tree oui monsieur were going to string popcorn popcorn you want to make this popcorn in my kitchen before jordan could answer francois was off on a stream of indignant french francois he turned and gave a stiff bow mademoiselle kasey smiled at him votre cuisine est magnifique she began then continued in flawless french she praised his food his stove his counters sampled the stock pot he had simmering while he joined the discussion with passion she was enthusiastic about the perfection of his cookware and impressed with his cutlery when she had finished he kissed her hand cordially bowed to jordan again and strolled from the room well jordan glanced at the closed door then back at kasey he watched as she took down a pan and placed it on the stove where did you learn to speak french like that my roommate at college was a language major wheres the popcorn he walked to her ignoring the question what did you say to him i always thought my french was good but the two of you went well beyond me just this and that kasey smiled i did tell him you wanted him and the rest of the kitchen staff to have the night off you do have popcorn dont you jordan laughed and reached into a bottom cabinet i smuggled it in at great personal risk youre a tough guy taylor she took the can from him ill need some oil he gestured for alison to get it then leaned close and whispered a quick french phrase in kaseys ear her mouth turned up im shocked she murmured interested but shocked i dont think ill ask you where you learned that in moments the kitchen was noisy with the popping of the corn alison sat at the butcher block table ankles crossed carefully cutting lengths of string jordan settled across from her and watched when was the last time he had sat listening to that sound he wondered in college no at his brothers house five perhaps six years ago perhaps kasey had been right he had insulated himself another masterpiece kasey declared turning the popcorn into a bowl no duds he dipped his hand into the bowl wheres the butter he demanded alisons hand brushed his as she dug in grab a needle kasey instructed each of them they worked in anything but silence alison chattered continually between mouthfuls her string of popcorn grew longer by the minute it seemed to kasey that they had sat like this before on other christmas eves that they would sit like this again but she knew better and shivered cold jordan asked her no she tried to shake off the feeling a goat ran over my grave thats a goose he said and smiled at her goose goat she shrugged she stuffed a piece of popcorn into her mouth youre not doing so well there jordan she observed i need incentive mines going to be the longest alison declared its going to be a hundred miles long dont count your chickens before they cross the road kasey advised how do you do that jordan she asked studying him did it come naturally or did you practice jordan shook his head in amused confusion i mean lift one eyebrow kasey explained its marvelous id love to be able to do it but both of mine work at the same time lets have some hot chocolate she sprang up and began to rummage through cupboards jordan abandoned his string and watched her kasey come here a minute jordan preparing hot chocolate requires concentration and care she measured in the milk crossing the room he took her arm and pulled her under the doorway he pointed above their heads with one finger kasey smiled at the mistletoe is it real she asked its real he assured her well in that case she touched her mouth lightly to his thats not how they kiss in the movies alison commented and plucked another piece of popcorn absolutely right jordan agreed before kasey could comment he drew her back into his arms and covered her mouth with his the kiss lengthened and the sweetness of it made kaseys throat ache she held him close she would remember that kiss before all the others she knew that was much better alison stated when kasey drew away my strings finished later they sat in the drawing room again alison was curled next to jordan on the sofa with kaseys guitar in her lap kasey watched the colors from the lights on the tree play across her face as she drifted into sleep shes had a long day kasey murmured im looking forward to seeing her face when she gets her presents tomorrow he slipped the guitar from alisons limp arms and handed it to kasey your little gift is safely tucked away charles is guarding my little gift in the garage im not sure hes going to part with it easily she rose ill take alison up and put her to bed ill do it jordan shifted his niece into his arms and stood why dont you put some music on when he had gone kasey went to the cabinet that held the stereo chopin she decided shifting through the albums it was a night for romance the house was quiet the servants were settled in their wing beatrice was at a party it might have been only the three of them in the house kasey sighed as she slipped the record onto the turntable for tonight she could pretend it was true wandering to the window she parted the curtains and looked out the moon was high and full the night clear she found pegasus again and mused over it when she heard the doors shut quietly she turned kasey watched jordan lock them did you settle her in all right her heart began to skip rapidly silly she thought i act as though its the first time ive been with him shes fine she never even woke up you sleep like that he crossed the room and set the bottle of wine he carried on the bar deep like a child he opened the wine then moved to the fireplace kneeling he set gas flames burning over the logs now you can pretend its snowing he smiled up at her you do see through me dont you at times when he had poured two glasses he moved back in front of the fire and sat he held up a hand for her kasey took it and settled next to him how do you feel he asked when she was leaning against him like im snowed in she murmured accepting the wine he offered snuggled in a log cabin in the adirondacks away from the world and its problems is there room in the log cabin for me she tilted her head to smile at him anytime wed have wood he said quietly and he took the glass from her hand and wine he bent to kiss the corner of her mouth and each other gently he lowered her to the floor we wouldnt need anything else no kaseys lids lowered as she drew him closer nothing else she lost herself in the feel of him in the taste of him her mind and body were in complete harmony and both belonged to him from somewhere deep in the center of the house the clock struck midnight and it was christmas how long they loved each other that night kasey would never know neither of them had wanted to unlock the door and open themselves to the rest of the world once when they dozed together jordan woke to hear the front door open and close behind his mother then the house was silent again theirs he turned to kasey and roused her slowly until she was quivering for him again and he for her there was firelight and the colors from the tree and the scent of pine the wine grew warm kasey slept again and woke groggily when jordan lifted her ill take you up he murmured i dont want to leave you she buried her face in his neck the nights are too short hours and hours too short then she was asleep again as deeply as alison had been when he had carried her up the stairs morning came all too soon only her own determination and alisons excitement kept kasey from crawling back under the covers the neat formal drawing room was soon strewn with torn paper boxes and discarded ribbons a cocker spaniel puppy kaseys gift to alison raced around the tree while alison sat awestruck with a new guitar a gift from her uncle on her lap shouldnt you wake your mother jordan kasey murmured pushing some crumpled paper aside at six oclock in the morning he laughed and shook his head mother doesnt rise before ten christmas or no christmas well have a very civilized brunch later kasey wrinkled her nose and grabbed for a box its about time i had one she announced knowing the gift was from alison ive heard a lot of whispering about this one she said unwinding the ribbon slowly seen a lot of telling looks alison caught her bottom lip between her teeth and looked at jordan like that one kasey stated and ripped the paper with a flourish opening the box she found a long pale green neck scarf in soft wool its the first present i ever made alison said anxiously rose the kitchen maid taught me i made some mistakes kasey tried to raise her eyes tried to speak but could do neither she stroked the awkwardly crocheted scarf with her fingers do you like it kasey looked up and nodded helplessly her eyes were already brimming over women jordan said tucking alisons hair behind her ear some women he corrected tend to weep when theyre particularly happy kaseys one of them really really kasey managed and took a deep breath alison its the most beautiful present ive ever had she gathered the girl into her arms and squeezed thank you she really likes it alison said grinning at jordan over kaseys shoulder do you think shell cry if you give her yours why dont we find out jordan reached under the tree for a small square box of course maybe shes not interested in any more presents of course i am kasey drew out of alisons arms im very greedy on christmas she took the box from him and drew a deep breath opening it she felt her heart lurch for the second time that morning she held the gold finely etched drop earrings remarkably similar to those she had seen the day she had bought his unicorn she looked up at him and shook her head jordan how did you remember something like this i havent forgotten anything youve told me i thought this went with it he handed her another box this one long and flat then smiled as she hesitated i thought you were greedy on christmas kasey opened the box and found three thin gold chains ingeniously twisted together to form one its beautiful she murmured he took the chain from her fingers and clasped it around her neck kasey swallowed then laid her cheek against his thank you jordan she scrambled up im going to see about some coffee she liked yours too alison told him and shifted her guitar she was crying again when millicent brought coffee and croissants into the drawing room fifteen minutes later she stood balancing the tray and stared in all her years in the taylor household shed never seen anything like it papers and ribbons and boxes were everywhere and mr taylor was wrestling with a puppy in the middle of it all mr taylor miss alison and miss wyatt were giggling no shed never seen anything like it not in this house chapter contents prev next kasey intended to keep herself very busy when she left palm springs first she was going home she had made her decision new years eve would mark her last full day with jordan all she had left to do was tell jordan after looking at it from every angle from hers from his from alisons kasey had decided to wait until the first of the year her flight was booked it would hurt less if the hours between werent heavy with the knowledge that they were the last ones shed cram everything she could into that final twentyfour hours id have had you in the third game of the second set if i hadnt doublefaulted she swung her racket at the air as she and jordan walked from the tennis court and if you hadnt served to my backhand in the fourth game of the second set i would have won that one too you really are a vicious player coming into the net like that he took her racket a bit leery of the enthusiasm she showed in swinging it look theres alison by the pool she appears to be dutifully doing her homework alison glanced up as they approached waved then settled back with a sigh uncle jordan i dont know what to do about this assignment no he set the rackets down on the umbrellaed table what is it i have to list five items typical of the nineteeneighties something id put into a time capsule to show future societies what our culture was like alison he grinned and ran a finger down her nose why ask a writer when you have an anthropologist oh i forgot she looked up at kasey what would you put in a time capsule lets see kasey narrowed her eyes against the sun a moment a stalk of wheat a container of petroleum an mos chip a cassette of punk rock music and a pair of gucci loafers jordan laughed and thats your encapsulization of the eighties alison frowned as she scribbled whats an mos chip its a oh no jordan stopped kaseys explanation cold dont get her started alison well alison said frowning at the list doubtfully i suppose id better think about this some more she gave kasey a look that told her shed been little help then left to work out her problem indoors im not sure that alison or her teacher is ready for your opinion on our society jordan commented it was my educated analysis of our culture as it stands today from technology to fashion you know jordan you really look hot after that tennis match you should cool off she gave him a firm shove and sent him backwards into the pool he surfaced pushing his hair from his eyes impulse she claimed and grabbed her middle as she laughed ive never had a firm control over impulses saying nothing he narrowed his eyes and swam to the edge sorry jordan but you really did look hot im sure the waters wonderful youre not mad are you ill help you out shed no more than offered her hand when she realized her mistake he took it firmly then grinned at her as he gave it a quick tug and sent her headlong into the water she came up sputtering i had that coming i suppose so you did hows the water terrific she treaded water with one hand and pulled off a sneaker with the other ive always thought she tossed the sneaker over his head and out of the pool that when you find yourself in an inevitable situation you should make the most of it she lofted her other shoe then doing a surface dive streaked along the bottom she jerked when jordans hands took her waist he turned her and she found herself tangled with him in an underwater kiss her heartbeat jumped from normal to frantic and she clung to him when she surfaced her pulse was still soaring i was making the most of an inevitable situation jordan murmured and caught the lobe of her ear in his teeth you scared me she took a deep breath i should never have seen that shark movie we dont stock sharks in the winter he ran a hand through her hair its nearly copper when its wet and the sun hits it the first day you were here i stood at my window and watched you swim i couldnt get you out of my mind even then she leaned her head on his shoulder it was so difficult to be strong when he was gentle she wanted to tell him again that she loved him that it was breaking her heart to have to leave him she didnt know even then what she would do if he asked her to stay or perhaps she did and that was why she had made her plans without telling him they couldnt go on as they were and she saw no future for them if he could love her but kasey shook her head and drew away from him ill race you she challenged im a much better swimmer than tennis player he smiled all right ill give you a head start kasey lifted her brows that is an assumption of male superiority she pushed her hair from her eyes ill take it she was off like a rocket in a flurry of water even with her advantage jordan reached the far edge two strokes ahead of her kasey wrinkled her nose at him of course she began and stood in the shallow water if id grown up in a pool she noted that he was paying no attention to her words following his eyes she glanced down the tshirt she had worn modestly enough on the tennis court now clung to her breasts rather than a cover it was an erotic invitation her brief shorts were molded wetly to her hips and upper thighs naked she would have been less of a temptation water ran slowly down the sleekness of her hair i think this sort of swimming apparel belongs in deeper water kasey decided and pushed away from the edge she was in his arms before she was halfway across the pool his mouth took hers hungry quickly desperate they lowered below the surface again tied to each other kasey hung on as a mixture of fear and passion ran through her there were sensations of weightlessness of claustrophobia of helplessness she might have fought against them but the will had slipped from her and she held him tighter he brought them up and air rushed into her lungs youre trembling he noticed abruptly did i frighten you i dont know she held on and let him keep them above surface oh jordan i want you she breathed the need was unexpectedly urgent and powerful his mouth found hers again his excitement was doubled by the desire he felt pouring out of her how long can you hold your breath he murmured not long enough she gave a shaky laugh and searched for his lips again not nearly long enough will we drown probably his hand ran down her side to her hip to her thigh and back to her waist do you care not at the moment just kiss me again just kiss me and dont say anything she couldnt bear it by that time the next day she would be on a plane she wouldnt be able to reach out and touch him to feel his hands on her she would have the taste of him only in memory these three months out of her life would be swallowed up by whatever was to come how could she leave how could she stay already the price she was going to have to pay seemed overwhelmingly high then shed take something else for the bargain she thought one last night one full last night jordan lets not go to that party tonight she drew away from him wanting to see his face i need to be alone with you the way we were in new york cant we go someplace just for tonight tomorrows a whole new year i want to spend the last night of this one with you just you a suite at the hyatt he murmured champagne and caviar i seem to recall youre rather fond of caviar yes her grip around his neck was quick and desperate as she brought her cheek to his or pizza and beer at the last chance motel it doesnt matter i love you she couldnt stop herself from saying it i love you so much her mouth fastened on his before he could speak jordan beatrices voice broke through the quiet jordan drew his mouth from kaseys without hurry mother he glanced up keeping an arm around kasey back so soon what are you doing why im swimming he told her easily and kissing kasey was there something you wanted youre aware that we have servants who could wander out here at any time yes was there something else beatrices eyes flared but she kept her dignity kasey was forced to admire her for it harry rhodes phoned he needs to see you in an hour on business he says its quite important all right thank you youve made her angry jordan kasey commented when beatrice left them ill probably make her a good deal angrier he mused it was time for some changes he thought some definite changes the house was his inheritance but it might be wise to turn it over to her and take alison elsewhere and kasey kasey was something else well they had the whole night to talk about it he decided and pulled her close again if youre ready when i get back from talking to harry we can start early talk fast kasey told him kasey had just dried her hair when the knock came at her bedroom door come in she opened her closet the green dress again tonight she wondered and pulled it out hello millicent the maid hovered in the doorway miss millicent folded her hands in front of her and looked uncomfortable mrs taylor would like to see you in her sitting room now kasey fingered the material of the dress she held yes please i might as well get it over with she thought and hung the dress back in the closet it was going to be unpleasant if she hadnt known it already the maids face told everything all right ill go right now millicent cleared her throat im to take you kasey sighed she could hardly blame the maid lead on she invited and followed her millicent knocked on beatrices door turned the knob then hurried away kasey took one last deep breath and entered mrs taylor come in miss wyatt beatrice never turned from her ivory toned desk and shut the door kasey obeyed and found herself itching for a cigarette the room was oppressive and she thought as difficult to live with as the woman what can i do for you mrs taylor sit down miss wyatt she waved her hand toward an edwardian chair its time we had a chat kasey seated herself and awaited the inevitable youve stretched your time here as far as possible beatrice turned to her now and folded her hands on the desk are you concerned with jordans research mrs taylor you cant hurt me today she told herself its my last one why dont you tell me just whats on your mind mrs taylor and spare us both she said aloud ive checked your credentials beatrice tapped a gold pen against the desk it was her only outward sign of emotion you seem to be considered an expert in your field you checked up on me kasey could feel the anger rising and tried to stem it in doing so i learned youre samuel wyatts granddaughter im slightly acquainted with his daughter your aunt there was quite a scandal years back concerning you a very unfortunate affair she tapped the pen again a pity you didnt stay with your aunt rather than being raised by your grandfather please kaseys voice had lowered dont make me angry beatrice noted she had cracked kaseys calm that had been her first objective you werent in your paternal grandfathers will you have done your share of checking im a very thorough woman miss wyatt but not one to quickly come to the point the point then beatrice agreed apparently youre financially solvent but hardly loaded kasey suggested in your vernacular beatrice conceded your stay here has been a very lucrative arrangement for you its quite understandable that you would pursue the possibilities of future rewards by ingratiating yourself with jordan and with alison future rewards kasey felt the burning start in the pit of her stomach i didnt think id need to be graphic beatrice set down the pen and folded her hands again jordan is a very wealthy man alison will come into a very healthy inheritance at maturity i see kasey struggled to keep her hands still youre implying that i hope to benefit financially by developing a relationship with jordan and alison she gave beatrice a long level look youre a hard lady mrs taylor doesnt it occur to you that id care about them regardless of the size of their bankbooks no beatrice let the word hang a moment ive dealt with your type before alisons mother was one but my son wouldnt listen he chose to marry her over my objections and move halfway across the country of course she said as she sat back and eyed kasey the problem is different in this case jordan has no intention of marrying you hes satisfied with an affair again in your vernacular you overplayed your hand kasey wanted to throw something she wanted to rip some holes in the perfection of white that surrounded her she sat rigid with control im aware of the boundaries of my relationship with jordan mrs taylor i always have been you dont have anything to worry about im not going to tolerate you under my roof any longer your influence on alison will take months to repair a lifetime i hope kasey rose she had to get out of that room youre never going to fit her into that mold again shes outgrown it jordan has custody of alison it was the tone not the words that halted kasey she felt a quick thrill of fear yes beatrice turned a bit in her chair so she might face kasey directly if you dont leave today this afternoon ill be forced for alisons sake to sue him for custody of her thats absurd the fear came back doubled in force she felt the cold hit her skin no court would give you custody over jordan perhaps perhaps not beatrice moved her shoulders elegantly but you know how distressing a court battle can be particularly when theres a child involved suing on the grounds of immoral conduct would make it particularly unpleasant hes your son the words came out as barely a whisper you couldnt do that to him to alison jordans done nothing to hurt her he never would alison requires protection she gave kasey a cool glance so does jordan protection you mean manipulation dont you she crossed back to beatrice she had to be dreaming but not even her nightmare hurt this acutely you wouldnt do this to them you couldnt shes just a child she loves him she wouldnt cry in front of this woman you dont have anything to gain from this you dont love alison the way jordan does you dont need her if you could understand what its like to be fought over this way you wouldnt do it beatrice took a small breath the choice is up to you it was incredible impossible but kasey saw she meant every word she said i was going tomorrow she said quietly im not worth it mrs taylor today before jordan returns youre to say nothing of this to him today kasey agreed there were tears in her voice she couldnt prevent them she straggled to keep them from her eyes today because im capable of something youre not of loving them both enough to give them what they need each other beatrice turned her back again millicent will have your bags packed by now and charles will drive you wherever youd like to go she opened her checkbook im willing to compensate you for your discretion and for your inconvenience miss wyatt kaseys hand slammed down on the checkbook and cut her off beatrice looked up in surprise dont press your luck kasey whispered i gave you my word its free she lifted her hand slowly and straightened therell come a time when youll have to deal with what you did today youve lost more than i ever had mrs taylor she made it out the door then nearly doubled over with the pain she needed time a few moments to pull herself back together she still had to see alison she wouldnt leave without saying goodbye to her let me find the right words kasey moved down the hall like a sleepwalker dont let me cry in front of alison the sharp flash of pain had left her numb she reached for the knob of alisons door with nerveless fingers kasey alison glanced up the puppy was curled on the bedspread while alison sat with him plucking at her guitar i learned a new song shall i play it for you alison kasey came to sit beside her whats wrong the childs forehead creased as she studied kasey you look funny alison you remember i told you that someday id have to go she saw the look in the childs eyes and touched her cheek its someday alison no she set the guitar aside and grabbed kaseys hand you dont have to you could stay i explained it to you before remember about my job you dont want to stay the tears were starting kasey felt a moment of panic alison its not a matter of wanting i cant you could you could if you wanted to alison look at me kasey was on the edge and knew it but there was no leaving her this way sometimes people cant do exactly what they want i love you alison but i have to go what will i do it was almost a wail as she threw her arms around kaseys neck you have jordan and ill write you i promise maybe in the summer you can visit like we talked about before the summers months and months away kasey hugged her tight then drew her back sometimes time goes quickly she slipped the gold band from her finger and pressed it into alisons hand this is for you whenever you think i dont love you anymore you can look at it and remember i do rising she walked to the doorway the pain was festering and her time was running out alison she turned back with her hand on the knob tell jordan i she shook her head and opened the door just take care of him for me there was only one small light on in her hotel room but even that hurt her eyes kasey couldnt summon the energy to walk over and switch it off the weeping had drained her left her sick and empty she could hear the sounds of celebration from other rooms it was nearly midnight i should be with him now kasey thought i should have had this one last night what did he think when he came back and found me gone gone without a word hell never understand he cant ever understand she reminded herself will he be hurt or just angry she shook her head it was no use speculating it was over she heard the rattle of a key and turned when jordan walked in she said nothing her thoughts were drowned in pain and shock you should use a chain when you want to shut someone out kasey he tossed the key onto a table keys are easy enough to come by twenty dollars and a good story buys one you know all about good stories she sat exactly where she was beatrices threat cut off her impulse to run into his arms how did you find me charles he turned and fastened on the chain though i had to visit a few bars to find him he had the night off you seem to have put the time to good use hed been drinking she noted if not heavily enough to show she had to keep calm her hands were beginning to shake and she curled her fingers around the edge of the dresser behind her jordan glanced around the small hotel room you didnt choose the hyatt i see no there were going to be angry words hard words kasey rose and reached for a cigarette isnt that ridiculous hotels are always leaving matches everywhere and i cant find one she caught her breath when he gripped her arms and spun her around why did you leave i had to leave sometime jordan her voice tightened with pain as his fingers dug into her skin we both know the research was finished research if he didnt keep his fingers tight he was afraid hed strike her shed hurt him more than he had known he could be hurt she had opened him up for the pain he gave her a savage shake is that all there is between us she was beginning to tremble all over but he didnt seem to notice she had never seen him like this brutal furious she wished he would hit her if that would bring a quick end to it damn you he shook her again nearly lifting her off her feet couldnt you at least have faced me with it did you have to leave behind my back without a word kasey gripped the dresser edge again the sickness was rising back to her throat its better this way jordan i better the word exploded from him kasey jumped for whom if you didnt have the decency to think of me what about alison that was almost too much to bear kasey closed her eyes a moment i thought of alison jordan you must believe i thought of alison how can i believe anything you say she was devastated look at me he took her hair and pulled her head back i spent an hour holding her while she cried trying to make her understand what i couldnt i did what i had to do her head was beginning to spin she had to make him leave and quickly jordan youve had too much to drink her voice was amazingly calm now and youre hurting me i want you to go you said you loved me kasey swallowed and straightened i changed my mind she watched the color drain from his face changed your mind the words came slowly with no understanding thats right now go and leave me alone ive a plane to catch in the morning bitch he whispered the word as he dragged her against him ill go when im finished we still have a date no she struggled against him in quick panic no jordan well finish what you started he told her here now and his mouth was on hers cutting off her protest kasey pushed against him wild with fear would even this be taken from her the memories of the joy of loving him being loved by him he was dragging her toward the bed and she fought but he was strong and senseless with rage what are we doing to each other her mind dimmed as he ripped the shirt from her shoulders his hands were everywhere pulling tearing her clothes as she struggled against him the memory of beatrices calm cool face floated behind her eyes i wont let you do this to us kasey stopped struggling under jordans mouth hers softened and surrendered i can give you this she told him silently and felt her panic subside one last night she hasnt taken it from us after all she stopped thinking and let herself love chapter contents prev next kasey awoke to full blinding light she moaned in automatic protest and rolled over her hand touched the emptiness beside her she opened her eyes he was gone she struggled to sit up scanning the room quickly for some sign of jordan when she laid her hand on the pillow beside hers she found it cool when had he gone she remembered only that they had loved each other again and again in the night in desperation and in silence she thought he had slept was certain they had had a few hours of total peace together she needed to know they had no one could take those last hours from her if there hadnt been tenderness there had been need he wont hurt anymore her last hope was that the night would have purged the pain from him if not his anger she doubted jordan would ever forgive her for her method of ending it kasey rose from the bed she still had a plane to catch when she saw the note on the dresser she stared at it it might be better not to read it to pretend she hadnt seen it what could he say to her now that wouldnt bring the pain flooding back but she reached for it before she could stop herself she opened it and read kasey an apology for last night would mean little but i have nothing else to offer anger is no excuse for what happened i can only tell you i regret it more than anything ive ever done im leaving you a check for your services of the last month i hope you realize what youve given me because i dont have the words to tell you jordan kasey read the letter through once then again shed been right to think it would bring pain she crumpled it in her hand then dropped it on the floor regret it she thought and slowly picked up the check that had been laid beneath the note she was cold now she had little emotion left to spend briskly she scanned the amount and gave a quick laugh generous jordan youre a generous man she tore the check methodically into tiny pieces and let them drift to the floor that ought to drive your accountant crazy she wasnt going to cry again there werent any tears left with a shuddering sigh kasey reached for a cigarette montana she decided all at once montana will have six feet of snow and be cold as hell now wasnt the time to go home she thought it would be too easy to fall apart at home dashing to the phone kasey prepared to change her plans dr edward brennan switched off the ignition on his old pontiac the sun was beginning to set and hed put in a full day his back let him know it getting old he mused as he sat thered been a day when he could have delivered three babies plucked out a pair of tonsils set a broken tibia and inoculated three families against flu before lunch without slackening speed but he was seventy and thinking it was time to slow down maybe it was time to take on an associate someone young with fresh ideas dr brennan liked fresh ideas he smiled a moment and watched the sunset too bad kasey hadnt taken to medicine shed have made a hell of a doctor what a bedside manner she would have had there were orange streaks shooting through the trees on his mountain he was very proprietary about his little section of land his mountain his sunset he felt that way when he sat alone it was a good feeling and kept him going opening the car door he lifted out the bundle of homemade bread and preserves that mrs oates had pressed on him when he had treated her boy for chicken pox he would enjoy his fee with a cup of coffee after he thought as he stretched his tired back he might just have a glass of the illegal whiskey mr oates had slipped him before he had left oates had the best still on the east side of the mountain the door to his house was never locked and he pushed it open already tasting the bread hello pop dr brennan jolted then stared at the woman seated behind his kitchen table kasey he was stunned to find her and surprised that she hadnt jumped up to rush to him for a fierce hug and noisy kiss it was her traditional way of greeting him whether they had been parted for a day or a year i thought you were still in tennessee nope im right here she smiled at him then glanced at the bundle he carried smells like fresh bread part of your fee mrs oates he answered crossing the room to set the bundle on the table ah kasey grinned up at him then youll have something a little more lively from mr oates i imagine hows your stomach lining sturdy enough for a glass or two she laid a hand on his how are you pop fine kasey he was studying her face carefully with a mixture of affection and professionalism something was not quite right he squeezed her hand in return shed tell him when she was ready in her own way hed known her too long to expect anything else what about you what have you been up to i havent had one of your sixpage letters in nearly a month not too much she gave a half shrug i spent a couple of weeks in montana i got a terrific coat there it would keep you warm in the aleutians i joined the phiefer team for a while in utah molly phiefers just as tough as ever she celebrated her sixtyeighth birthday in camp i did a twopart lecture in st paul and fished for trout in tennessee and i quit smoking her eyes darkened she drew in her breath pop im pregnant pregnant his eyes shot open what do you mean pregnant pop kasey reached for his hand youre a doctor you know what pregnant means kasey dr brennan discovered he had to sit down how did it happen the traditional way she said attempting a smile even modern methods arent always reliable she added anticipating the inevitable question hed let that pass for now how far along are you whats today he was used to her casual indifference to the passing of time may seventeenth four months and seventeen days very specific he noted with a nod of his head im sure she laced and unlaced her hands observing the nervous move he switched to professionalism have you seen a doctor are you having any discomfort any side effects yes ive seen a doctor she smiled again soothed by the objective questions no im not having any discomfort and after an unfortunate month of morning sickness i havent any side effects were disgustingly healthy and the father she laced her hands again im sure hes very healthy too kasey he cupped his hand over her fingers to stop their movement what are his plans about the baby obviously youve decided to complete the pregnancy you and the babys father must have come to terms of some kind no we havent come to terms of any kind she looked at him directly and some of the vulnerability seeped through i havent told him havent told him he was more shocked by this than anything else it simply wasnt like her when do you plan to i plan not to she reached for a cigarette and began to tear it into small pieces kasey he has a right to know its his baby no her eyes shot up again its my baby the baby has rights i have rights jordan can take care of himself thats not like you kasey he said quietly please she shook her head and crushed the remains of the cigarette in her hand dont i didnt make this decision overnight ive thought about it for months i know its the right thing to do my baby isnt going to be pulled apart because his father and i made mistakes i know what would happen if i told jordan her voice was beginning to shake and she took a moment to steady it hed offer to marry me hes an honorable man id refuse because i couldnt bear her voice broke again and she shook her head impatiently i couldnt bear to have him ask me out of obligation then hed want to set me up some kind of financial support i dont need it my baby doesnt need it thered have to be structured visitation rights with the baby bouncing from coast to coast never knowing where he belonged its not fair i wont have it the baby belongs to me he took her hands again and gave her a long look do you love the father he watched her crumple before his eyes oh god yes kasey laid her head on the table and wept her grandfather let her cry it out he hadnt seen this sort of grief from her since she had been a child he kept her hands in his and waited what sort of man was this jordan whose baby she carried if she loved him why was she weeping here alone instead of sharing the joy of impending parenthood with him he tried to remember the patches of information from her letters he knew who jordan was the writer she had worked with during late fall and early winter of the last year dr brennan had admired his work kaseys letters had been enthusiastic and confusing but he was used to both from her why hadnt he read between the lines and now for months she had been dealing with the most important decision in her life alone he hated to see her this way lost weeping once he had had to send her away from him she had been lost and weeping then too he had thought his own decision had been right for her and when the dust had settled it had been but the time in between had had its effect on her he was intuitive enough to know that part of her present decision stemmed from her own experiences all he could offer her was time and support and his love he hoped it would be enough her weeping had stopped kasey kept her head down on the table while she rested from it she hadnt given into tears for months slowly she straightened and began to speak again i loved him i do love him thats one of the reasons im handling it this way she sighed she had needed to talk to someone since she had walked out of beatrices sitting room four months before let me explain things to you and maybe youll understand her voice was quiet now without emotion and she detailed the circumstances in the taylor household when she spoke of alison he saw the parallel immediately and kept his silence only when she told him of her final encounter with beatrice did he explode are you telling me she threatened you he had sprung up forgetting the strain in his back he was ready to fight not me kasey reached for his hand and drew herself to her feet jordan alison there was nothing she could do to me nothing that would have mattered it was blackmail kasey simple ugly blackmail his voice was rough with temper you should have gone straight to jordan and told him do you know what he would have done kasey took his arm he would have stormed in there just as youd like to do right now it would have been a horrible scene with alison right in the middle of it do you think i could take a chance on there being a court battle shes just a little girl i know how shed feel seeing her name and picture splashed in the papers listening to the whispering her eyes were eloquent and her tears had dried put yourself in my place pop you were very close to it once if you had to change what you did all those years ago would you he sighed and drew her into his arms kasey i never thought youd have to go through something like this again she had needed to come home to feel his big strong arms and gentle hands she had needed a rock and had never known a sturdier one i love you pop i love you kasey he held her for a moment and said nothing it struck him suddenly that she was no longer willow slim he could feel the roundness as she pressed against him unprofessionally he was shocked by the change she wasnt his baby anymore but a woman carrying one of her own it just occurs to me he said softly im going to be a greatgrandfather youve always been a great grandfather kasey murmured the best youll stay until the baby comes kasey sighed and relaxed against him ill stay he drew her away are you taking vitamins yes doctor she grinned and kissed his cheek and drinking your milk she kissed his other cheek what do you think of bryan she asked him it could work whether the babys a boy or a girl i think bryan wyatt has a nice sound dignified but not stuffy he lifted his brows i can see my works cut out for me or theres paul she went on as he walked to the refrigerator of course id have to have a boy then kasey watched as he poured a tall glass of milk are we going to have some of mrs oatess goodies now she opened the bundle are these damson preserves she asked as she held up a mason jar i love damson preserves good dr brennan handed her the glass of milk and smiled you can have some with your milk before i examine you chapter contents prev next it was july before kasey knew it there were wildflowers in the woods and geraniums in the kitchen window box at night the crickets sang incessantly she could lie in bed late and listen to them while the baby moved restlessly inside her hes in a hurry she thought or they are her grandfather was all but certain there were two she had refused his suggestion that they go down to the hospital and make certain she wanted to be surprised it had been a long time since she had slept deeply the baby wouldnt permit it they wouldnt permit it kasey didnt need any sophisticated equipment to tell her there were two no one baby could be so active when one slept the other was wide awake and kicking and she was huge kasey rested a hand on either side of her stomach i wont go full term she mused twins traditionally arrive early closing her eyes she began to drift again she liked the movements inside her liked knowing life was growing impatient to arrive she could almost see how they would look a boy and a girl she thought with warm brown hair and dark blue eyes when she looked at the eyes she would think of jordan she shifted again as she felt the distinct shove of an elbow what was he doing now she wondered what time was it in california early enough that he might still be working would he have finished the book kasey wanted badly to find it in a bookstore to bring it home and closet herself with it it would bring him back along with all the hours they had spent together in his study she could save it for her children they would never know it was their father who had written it but they would learn to admire and respect him through his words she wanted that for them and for jordan and alison kasey rolled from her side to her back she had written the girl as she had promised her own zigzagging course across the country had made it impossible for alison to answer i should hear from her soon now kasey mused ive been settled for nearly two months i wrote nearly three weeks ago kasey pulled herself from bed and walked to the window it was hot and sultry making sleep that much more difficult it might be best if she did forget me i can hardly ask her to visit me now she stroked her hand over her stomach thered be no way to explain to her and no way to be certain jordan wouldnt find out hell take care of her and keep her safe and ill do the same for our babies the movement inside her stopped kasey went back to bed and slept dr brennan watched kasey as she knelt on the ground between rows of vegetables and weeded she was blooming he had no worries about her physically she was the picture of health and strong she had taken up her life again with characteristic enthusiasm he was proud of her he had some doubts about the wisdom of her decision but she was dead certain he had plans to speak with her again about jordan but he would give her until she had delivered and was on her feet again the baby was his main concern and the babys mother i dont know why i planted lima beans she muttered and ripped at a stubborn weed i hate lima beans but i just love the way they all sit in a fat little pod i suppose i could have them bronzed she sat back on her heels and dusted her hands some of the tomatoes are ripe you could have them with supper tonight with the corn lloyd cramer gave you for his appendix she shielded her eyes from the sun and smiled up at him i got the best of the deal his appendix was in bad shape youre so mercenary she held up a hand so he could help her to her feet then she kissed him with her usual exuberance do you think i should water the garden it hasnt rained all week he glanced up at the sky watering the gardens a sure way to bring it on we could use it the heats keeping you up at night that among other things she patted her stomach and no im not tired she laughed anticipating his question ive got enough energy for all of us did you have your milk today my carrots arent doing well kasey responded im going to get the hose ill water it this evening when it cools off go have a glass now ill throw up she threatened that hasnt worked since you were twelve she narrowed her eyes measuring him she knew he was every bit as stubborn as she was im going to make scalloped potatoes for dinner and vanilla custard thats enough milk for anybody youll get fat i am fat she dashed into the house before he could comment she sat at the kitchen table and peeled a small mountain of potatoes was growing in front of her there was something soothing in the simple mindless chore and she skinned more than her grandfather and she could possibly eat in a single sitting well have leftovers she decided and glanced at the pile all week this is the last one she promised herself and shook the potato in her hand or well have to invite the neighborhood she didnt glance up as the door opened but continued wielding the peeler you might have to dig up a couple of starving patients she said aloud i got carried away here you know they dont peel potatoes by hand in the army anymore a terrible lack of tradition they have these machines and she glanced up and froze jordan watched the color drain slowly from her face he saw vivid shock in her eyes and fear the fear made his stomach twist she dropped the peeler and her hands shot under the table oh god dear god she thought desperately what do i do what do i say he said nothing but his eyes were riveted on her face her hair was longer he noted almost to her shoulders now when had she grown beautiful she had been striking alluring unforgettable but when had she grown beautiful he couldnt take his eyes from her face how long had he waited to see it again to watch it light up for him it wasnt lit now it was terrified that was his doing but it wasnt too late it couldnt be too late all these months of desperation couldnt be for nothing was her skin as soft as he remembered would she cringe if he touched her he was afraid to test it and could only stare at her kasey gripped her hands together tightly under the table she had to do something to say something she waited a moment until she was certain her voice wouldnt give her away hello jordan she smiled at him while her nails bit into her palms passing through he took a few steps toward her but kept the table between them without it he would have to touch her ive been looking for you for months it came out as an accusation he hadnt meant to greet her that way he had sworn to himself he would be calm but calmness had deserted him the moment she had looked up at him have you kasey managed to keep her eyes level im sorry ive been doing some traveling is it something about the book i dont know of anything we didnt cover would you stop he was shouting at her how could he be shouting at her now he asked himself but he couldnt stop everything that had kept him going since she had left had crumbled the moment he had set eyes on her again ive spent six months in hell how can you sit there looking at me as though i were a neighbor dropping in for a visit he skirted the table before she could speak and dragged her to her feet damn it kasey his voice trailed off as he looked at her oh god it was barely more than a whisper as his gaze swept down then up to her face again youre pregnant yes i am his hold had loosened she felt his fingers drop away one at a time he stared at her as though hed never seen her before you he shook his head as if he were resurfacing youre carrying my child and you havent told me she took a step away from him my child jordan i never said it was yours she was pulled back against him so quickly she didnt have time to gasp his eyes were no longer blank but furious look at me he demanded between his teeth look at me and say its not mine he saw the fear jump into her eyes again and released her why couldnt he stop himself from repeating the mistake that had caused him to lose her jordan turned away and searched for control he hadnt been prepared for this how could he have been prepared for this a long long moment passed before he could trust himself to speak again in gods name kasey he said quietly how could you keep this from me no matter how you felt about me i had a right to know my baby has rights jordan her voice held the deadly calm of desperation im not concerned with yours he faced her again ready to plead if necessary hed shelved his pride months before dont shut me out kasey please he started to touch her then when she stiffened he dropped his hand to his side there were a hundred things he had planned to say when he finally found her but now there was only one i love you no she struck out at him in a furious slap dont you say that to me dont you dare say that to me now her eyes were dry one minute and flooding the next i would have given anything to have heard that from you six months ago anything what you gave me was a note and a check for services rendered as though i were a no kasey please you cant think he reached for her again but she pushed him away i havent slept with many men surprised she drew both hands over her cheeks to push away tears but youre the first who ever left payment kasey no it was nothing like that her words left him shaken let me explain i dont want explanations she shook her head and walked away from him i want you to go i asked you once before to leave me alone now im asking you again i couldnt then i cant now dont you understand i dont want to understand she took deep breaths i dont need to her voice was calm again but she didnt turn to him im sorry i hit you ive never done anything like that before kasey please gently he touched her shoulder just sit down and listen to me you loved me once i cant leave this way she didnt move she didnt answer jordan felt the panic rising up and forced it down again just hear me out then ill go if thats what you want all right she moved away from his touch and sat down ill listen to you he didnt know where to begin or how where were his words when i woke up that last morning he hesitated his mind was so crowded with all he wanted to say and his emotions were hammering at him she carried his child inside her right now she had her hands folded over her stomach as if she would protect what was partly his from him when i woke up he continued i hated myself i remembered that i had come into your room i remembered everything i had said to you what i had done you were still sleeping i left the note because i thought you wouldnt want to see me again why did you think that dear god kasey i he had had to deal with it for half a year and now he had to say it i raped you i woke up and there were bruises on your arms that i had put there now it was he who turned away he walked to a window and his knuckles whitened on the sill ill have to live with that for my entire life kasey sat in silence for a moment an honorable man she thought and laid her hands on the arms of the chair and an honorable man cant bear knowing he could contemplate doing something dishonorable perhaps if she hadnt hurt so badly herself she could have read his pain in the note he had left her jordan she waited until he turned to face her again what happened that night was a long way from rape i could have stopped you or fought you all the way you know i didnt it wouldnt have made any difference if you had he walked to her again i was drunk and crazy i hurt you you told me from the very beginning i would he paused again but never took his eyes from her face i think you should know that i was going to ask you to marry me that night he saw the shock fill her eyes before they closed when i got back from seeing harry and found youd gone i couldnt believe it i got angry quickly it was easier to deal with that way you opened me up forced me to feel again and then when you meant everything to me you walked away i wanted to hurt you she still sat with her eyes closed and he studied her face as he spoke for weeks those first weeks after you walked into my life i had told myself i couldnt be in love with you it was too quick i was just attracted intrigued if i hadnt been such a fool i might not have lost you you gave me everything freely and i took it but i was afraid to give too much back to you she opened up her eyes again and looked at him theres too much in the way even now jordan please dont say any more you told me youd listen youre going to hear it all he watched her hands slip back over the baby something ripped inside him and he took a moment before continuing after that last night together when youd gone i tried to forget i told myself youd lied to me i told myself youd been playing a game then id remember how you looked that first time you told me you loved me i knew you had gone because i hadnt given you anything back and because when id had my last chance id hurt you jordan its done she began dont i tried to live without you he shook his head and crouched down in front of her chair so their eyes were nearly level there was no color youd taken all the color with you i came after you came after me she repeated your first letter to alison came from montana when i got there youd left three days before three days it might as well have been years youd left no forwarding address and because youd rented a car there was no way of tracing you i started to hire detectives but then i remembered he stopped again and rose i thought how you might feel so instead i went back and prayed for you to write alison again jordan dragged a hand through his hair as he relived the frustration and panic each time you wrote i tried to catch you before you moved on once i missed you by five hours i thought id go mad i knew i couldnt keep leaving alison that way even for a day or two and i began to think youd keep moving one step ahead of me for the rest of my life then your last letter came when you said you were going to be staying with your grandfather for a few months alison was so excited losing you has been hard on her kasey shook her head and balled her hands into fists dont im sorry he took one of her rigid hands into his as soon as she got the letter she wanted to come out and see you she said you told her she could yes i had kasey removed her hand she couldnt let him touch her not now shed never be strong enough to send him away if he was touching her jordan looked down at his empty hand a moment then slipped it into his pocket i didnt want to leave her with my mother again not even for a few days i told her wed both come alisons here kasey felt the smile light her face outside no jordan swallowed the envy the smile was for alison but not for him i wanted to see you alone first had to see you alone shes back at the hotel theres a family there with a couple of kids whove taken to her she was hoping youd come with me when i went back to get her kasey shook her head i cant do that id love to see her if youd bring her here jordan felt a fresh flash of pain he was losing and he was powerless to prevent it all right if thats what you want were taking the rest of the summer to look for a new place a new place he had to talk about something anything to keep from pressuring her to keep from begging her i decided some time ago just before christmas actually that alison needed to get out of that house away from my mother ive already had the papers drawn up to turn the house over to her we wont need anything so large i told alison wed look together and try to be settled somewhere by the time she starts school again he was ready to explode jordan turned to her again and the passion showed in his face dont ask me to leave now that ive found you kasey dont turn away from me you cant ask me to walk away from you from my child my child kasey rose now shed be stronger if she were standing our child jordan corrected quietly you cant change that a childs entitled to know his father if you cant think of me think of the baby i am thinking of the baby she pressed her hands to her temples and pushed maybe it would ease the tension i didnt expect you to come here i didnt expect you to love me i knew what i had to do but i did come jordan took her shoulders gently and i do love you no she stepped back shaking her head dont touch me she covered her eyes and didnt see the flash of emotion in jordans i knew what i had to do she repeated i cant afford to think about you about me i have to think of my baby i cant take chances with my baby chances jordan began but she was stumbling on i wont have him shipped from coast to coast hes going to know where he belongs nobodys going to pull at him i wont have it not this time this time its my choice she was sobbing now with her hands covering her face he knew no way to bring comfort this is my baby not a piece of property we can split down the middle she might try to get at me through the baby she might try to take him from me i lost you i lost alison but i cant lose this baby it would kill me your mothers not going to get her hands on my baby what are you talking about he forgot himself and took her elbows pulling her hands from her eyes what are you saying kasey didnt answer she was breathing quickly she didnt know what she had said jordans eyes narrowed to slits did my mother have anything to do with your leaving kasey started to shake her head but his look stopped her you dont lie worth a damn so dont try it what did she say to you what did she do when she didnt answer he forced his voice into calmness there was fear in her eyes again but this time he knew it wasnt he who had put it there youre going to tell me exactly what went on between you a very good idea dr brennan spoke as he came in the front door jordan glanced over but didnt release kaseys arm no one was going to stop him from learning the truth now no need to pick up the club son he told jordan amused i told her thats what she should do when she came home months ago pop dont interfere dont interfere he raised his brows at his granddaughter you always were snippy pop please kasey pulled her arms away from jordan youve got to stay out of this the devil i do he boomed out at her this man has a right to know what went on behind his back you just stopped playing solitaire kasey ive dealt him in she shook her head going to him alison hell take care of alison kasey any fool could see that are you going to tell him or am i you tell me jordan addressed dr brennan directly i want it straight sensible sit down and shut up kasey her grandfather ordered no i wont kathleen sit her chin came up at the tone but the training of a lifetime had her obeying all right jordan the doctor began this might not be easy to hear would you like to sit down no jordan bit off the word then caught himself no thank you i will im getting old dr brennan settled himself your mother put kasey in a position of choosing he began i would conclude that shes an excellent judge of character as she must have known what kaseys choice would be her own happiness or yours and alisons i dont understand what youre saying the best way is straight up then your mother threatened to sue for custody of alison unless kasey took her bags and left on the spot sue for jordan pulled his hand through his hair again thats crazy she doesnt want alison and in any case there wouldnt be grounds for a suit i said she was a good judge of character dr brennan glanced at his granddaughter frowning jordan followed his eyes he felt the strength drain out of him oh god he rubbed his hands over his face in a gesture of fatigue i suppose she found out about kaseys background she should have come to me he spoke quietly to the doctor again i would never have let my mother get away with a threat like that she should have come to me yes dr brennan nodded in agreement but she wouldnt take the risk with two people she loved your mother threatened to sue on grounds of immoral conduct pop the word was only a tired whisper all of it kasey all at once and he turned back to jordan she offered to pay her that was her only miscalculation there was a window above the kitchen sink which looked out over the mountains jordan walked to it and stared out im having a difficult time handling this his voice was strained and raw i knew she was capable of a lot of things but i wouldnt have believed this of her i appreciate your telling me jordan thought he had felt all the rage he could feel all the pain he could stand but hed been wrong now he wasnt sure which was uppermost ill deal with my mother dr brennan you can be sure of it i am sure of it after casting a last look at kasey her grandfather rose i have a garden to water he left them and the room dropped into silence kasey took a deep breath it was out now all of it there would be little more to say im going to fix some tea rising she walked over to set a kettle on to boil kasey theres nothing i can say or do that will ever make up for this it wasnt your doing jordan and its not your place to make up for it she reached above her head into a cupboard its herbal tea pops cut off my caffeine kasey please keep still a minute she stopped and turned to face him jordan drew together all of his words he had to say everything quickly and get out while he could still stand first i promise you my mother will never come anywhere near our your baby he felt the pain rolling around in his stomach as he relinquished his rights i wont make any demands ill give you financial support if youll take it ill understand if you wont jordan no dont say anything yet he knew he had to get it out quickly the babys yours completely yours i accept that you have my word i wont ever make any claim i know how much alison means to you ill leave her with you for a few days if you like while i go back to deal with my mother it doesnt matter jordan it matters to me he lifted a hand as if to stop himself from breaking free of control when ive found a place for us and were settled ill send your grandfather our address all id like is to know when the baby comes and that youre all right his words were changing everything what had made sense an hour before seemed absurd now people who love should be together jordan she began then made a slight sound and pressed a hand to her side what is it panicked he grabbed her arms are you in pain is it the baby oh god i should never have come i should never have upset you this way ill call your grandfather thats not necessary kasey smiled at him the babys kicking thats all hes very active jordan looked down slowly he brought up his hand to place his palm on the mound of her stomach life quivered impatiently beneath it simple wonder flooded through him part of himself was growing in there part of kasey between them theyd created a human being he could almost feel the outline of a tiny foot as it pounded against his hand when he lifted his eyes to hers kasey saw the swimming emotion the dazed awe she smiled and laid her hand on top of his you should feel it when he really gets going the pain swept down on him immediately stealing his color that would be his first and last contact with his child the last time he touched the woman he loved kasey saw the change before he turned to walk to the door dont let him go her heart shouted at her dont be a fool its a risk her mind reminded her for you for all of you take the risk her heart insisted youre strong enough youre all strong enough jordan she called to him before he reached the door dont go when he turned she was halfway across the room we need you she threw her arms around his neck i need you he wanted to take what she offered but held himself back kasey you dont have to do this for me i dont want oh shut up and kiss me theres been too much talk its been so long she found his mouth then heard his quiet moan of relief i love you he rained kisses over her face youll never go a day without hearing me say that again i love you really kiss me she murmured trying to halt his roving mouth you wont break the babies he pulled her against him losing himself in her taste she was his finally completely his babies he said suddenly and drew her away babies didnt i mention there were two jordan shook his head and gave a quick astonished laugh no he laughed again and crushed her against him he could feel the lives inside of her shifting and stretching no you didnt mention it how did i live without you for more than half a year it wasnt living he answered his own question ive just started to live again he gave her a feverish kiss as though he could fill six months of emptiness with one embrace he drew her back again and his eyes were intense strings this time he told her i want strings this time kasey on both of us she agreed and went into his arms epilogue contents prev next the fire roaring in the hearth had the living room cozy with heat outside there was two feet of snow and it was still falling kasey slipped a lastminute present under the christmas tree then stood back to admire it strings of popcorn draped and crisscrossed from top to bottom she grinned remembering the chaos of the kitchen the evening they had made them chaos remained one of her favorite things bending she toyed with a box with her name on the tag cheating jordan asked from the doorway and she quickly straightened certainly not she waited until he had crossed the room and slipped his arms around her just poking pokings not cheating pokings required at christmas is that your educated analysis dr taylor he nuzzled into her neck finding his favorite spot absolutely hows the book coming fine i have a fascinating main character he drew her away to look at her she was glowing was it christmas eve that made her glow this way i love you kasey he kissed her gently and im proud of you what for she linked her hands behind his neck and smiled i like specific compliments for earning your doctorate raising a family making a home of course i did it all by myself smiling she cupped his face in her hands jordan youre terribly sweet im crazy about you she drew him close until their mouths met it took only an instant for the kiss to heat they were locked tight enveloped in each other soft pleasure and hot passion merged its snowing jordan murmured i noticed kasey sighed softly as his lips brushed her neck weve got plenty of wood you chop it beautifully im always impressed she drew his head back far enough so that her mouth could find his theres wine in the cellar desire was pushing at him the wanting never seemed to lessen he slipped his hand under her shirt to roam her back do you remember the fantasy we talked about on christmas eve two years ago mmm kasey pressed closer snowed in she murmured with wood and wine and each other the cocker spaniel came barreling into the room just ahead of two scrambling toddlers run for your life kasey thought smiling as she rested her head on jordans shoulder bryan paul you two come back here alison bounded into the room on their heels you know youre not supposed to tease maxwell she sighed and shook her head as the twins collapsed on the floor with the dog clutched between them jordan watched as his children noisily adored the longsuffering dog he slipped his arm more snugly around kaseys shoulders theyre gorgeous he murmured it always astonishes me how perfectly gorgeous they are and so wellmannered kasey observed as bryan shoved paul aside to ensure a better grip on the dogs neck alison dove in to referee he laughed and drew her to face him again about that fantasy ill meet you at midnight she whispered right here you bring the wine ill bring the wood its a deal the children grew noisier and kasey knew a private conversation would soon be impossible besides she wanted to get down and play too one more thing she added and gave him one of her guileless smiles he gave her a puzzled look and she brought her mouth close to his were going to have another baby she told him or two she managed before his mouth crushed hers a matter of choice prologue contents prev next james sladerman frowned at the toe of his shoe hed been frowning since the summons from commissioner dodson had reached him in the squad room that morning after blowing out a long stream of smoke slade crushed out the cigarette in the mosaic ashtray to his left he barely shifted his body slade knew how to wait only the night before he had waited for more than five hours in a dark chilly car in a neighborhood where it paid to watch your back as well as your wallet it had been a tedious fruitless five hours as the stakeout had produced nothing but then slade knew from long experience that police work consisted of hours of endless legwork impossible boredom and paperwork punctuated by moments of stark violence still he preferred the fivehour wait to the twenty minutes he had spent in the commissioners carpeted beigewalled outer office it smelled of lemony polish and now his own virginia tobacco the keys of a typewriter clattered with monotonous efficiency as the commissioners secretary transcribed what the hell does he want slade wondered again throughout his career slade had studiously avoided the politics of police work because of an inherent dislike of bureaucracy in his climb from cadet to detective sergeant there had been little opportunity for his path to cross dodsons slade had had brief personal contact with dodson at his fathers funeral captain thomas c sladerman had been buried with all the glory and honor that comes from serving on the force for twentyeight years and dying in the line of duty mulling over it slade recalled that the commissioner had been sympathetic to the widow and the young daughter hed said the right things to the son perhaps on some level he had been personally grieved early in their careers dodson and sladerman had been partners they had still been young men when their paths had separated one finding a niche in politics and administration the other craving the action of the streets on only one other occasion had slade had onetoone contact with dodson then slade had been in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound the visit of the commissioner of police to a mere detective had resulted in talk and speculation that had embarrassed slade as much as annoyed him now he realized it would be all over the station house that the old man had called him in his frown became a scowl for a moment he wondered if he had committed some breach in procedure then became furious with himself for behaving like a kid hauled before the school principal the hell with it he decided forcing himself to relax the chair was soft too soft and too short to compensate slade curved his spine into the back and stretched out his long legs his eyes half closed when the interview was over he had the stakeout to look forward to again if it went down tonight hed have a few evenings free to spend at the typewriter with any luck and a solid month without interruptions he could finish the novel blocking out his surroundings he mentally reviewed the chapter he was working on sergeant sladerman annoyed by the distraction slade lifted his eyes slowly his expression cleared he realized hed wasted his time staring at the floor when the commissioners secretary provided a far more appealing view his smile was at once appraising and charming the commissioner will see you now the secretary answered the smile wishing hed looked at her like that before rather than sitting in sullen silence he had a face any female would respond to a bit narrow angular with dark coloring that came from italian ancestors on his mothers side the mouth had been hard in repose but now curved it showed both promise and passion black hair and gray eyes were an irresistible combination especially she thought when the hair was thick and a bit unruly and the eyes were smoky and mysterious he was an interesting prospect she thought as she watched slade unfold his long rangy frame from the chair as he followed her to the oak door he noted that the ring finger of her left hand was bare idly he considered getting her phone number on the way out the thought slipped to the back of his mind as she ushered him into the commissioners office there was a perillo lithograph on the right wall a lone cowboy astride a paint pony the left wall was crowded with framed photos commendations diplomas if slade found it an odd combination he gave no sign the desk with its back to the window was dark oak on it were papers in tidy stacks a gold pen and pencil set and a triple picture frame seated behind them was dodson a dark tidy little man who had always reminded slade more of a parish priest than new yorks commissioner of police his eyes were a calm pale blue his cheeks healthily ruddy thin wisps of white wove through his hair all in all dodson was the picture of avuncular gentleness but the lines in his face hadnt been etched by good humor sergeant sladerman dodson motioned slade to a chair with a gesture and a smile built like his father he thought briefly as he watched slade take his seat did i keep you waiting a bit like his father dodson thought again managing not to smile except that thered been talk that the sons real interest lay in writing not in police work tom had always brushed that aside dodson remembered my boys a cop just like his old man a damn good cop at the moment dodson was banking on it hows the family he asked casually while keeping those deceptive blue eyes direct fine thank you sir janice is enjoying college he offered slade a cigar when it was refused dodson lit one for himself slade waited until the smoke stung the air before answering just how he wondered did dodson know his sister was in college yes she likes it hows the writing he had to call on all of his training not to reveal surprise at the question his eyes remained as clear and steady as his voice struggling no time for small talk dodson thought tapping off cigar ash the boys already itching to be gone but being commissioner gave him an advantage he took another slow drag of the cigar watching the smoke curl lazily toward the ceiling i read that short story of yours in mirror dodson went on it was very good thank you what the hells the point slade wondered impatiently no luck with the novel briefly almost imperceptively slades eyes narrowed not yet sitting back dodson chewed on his cigar as he studied the man across from him had the look of his father too he mused slade had the same narrow face that was both intelligent and tough he wondered if the son could smile with the same disarming charm as the father yet the eyes were like his mothers dark gray and thoughtful skilled at keeping emotions hidden then there was his record dodson mused he might not be the flashy cop his father had been but he was thorough and thank god less impulsive after his years on the force the last three in homicide slade could be considered seasoned if an undercover cop wasnt seasoned by thirtytwo he was dead slade had a reputation for being cool perhaps a shade too cool but his arrests were clean dodson didnt need a man who looked for trouble but one who knew what to do once he found it slade he allowed a small smile to escape thats what youre called isnt it yes sir the familiarity made him uncomfortable the smile made him suspicious im sure youve heard of justice lawrence winslow curiosity came first then a quick search through his mental file presided over the new york appellate court before he was elected chief justice of the connecticut supreme court about fifteen years ago died of a heart attack four maybe five years ago facts and figures dodson mused the boy didnt waste words he was also a damn fine lawyer a judge who understood the full meaning of justice a good man his wife remarried two years ago and lives in southern france so what slade thought with fresh impatience as dodson gazed broodingly over his shoulder im godfather to his daughter jessica the same question zipped through slades mind as dodson focused on him again she lives in the family home near westport beautiful place a stones throw from the beach its quiet peaceful he drummed his fingers against the desk i imagine a writer would find it very appealing there was an uncomfortable premonition which slade pushed aside possibly was the old man matchmaking slade almost laughed out loud no that was too ridiculous over the last nine months there has been a rash of thefts throughout europe the abrupt change of subject startled slade so much that the surprise showed clearly on his face quickly he controlled it and lifted a brow saying nothing important thefts dodson continued mainly from museums gems coins stamps france england spain and italy have all been hit the investigation has led the respective authorities to believe the stolen articles have been smuggled into the states smugglings federal slade said briefly and he thought silently has nothing to do with a homicide detective or some justices spoiled daughter another uncomfortable thought came to him which he ignored smugglings federal dodson repeated a bit too amiably for slades taste he placed the tips of his neat fingers together watching the younger man over them i have a few connections in the bureau because of this cases delicate nature ive been consulted he paused a beat long enough for slade to comment if he chose to then went on some substantial leads in the investigation point to a small wellrespected antique shop the bureau knows theres an operator from the information i have theyve narrowed down the possibilities for dump sites and this shop is one of the chosen few he decided dryly its believed someone on the inside is on the take pausing he adjusted the picture frame on his desk they want to put an operative on it inside so that the head of the organization wont slip away from them this time hes clever dodson mused half to himself again dodson gave slade a moment to question or comment and again he went on as the other man remained silent allegedly the goods are hidden cleverly hidden in an antique then exported to this shop retrieved and ultimately disposed of it seems the feds have things under control barely masking his impatience slade reached for a cigarette theres one or two complications dodson waited for the hiss and flare of the match theres no concrete evidence nor is the identity of the head of the organization known a handful of accomplices yes but we want him or her he added softly the tone had slades eyes sharpening dont get interested he warned himself it has nothing to do with you swallowing the questions that had popped into his head he drew on his cigarette and waited theres also a more delicate problem for the first time since slade had walked into the room he noticed dodsons nerves the commissioner picked up his gold pen ran it through his fingers then stuck it back in its slot the antique shop alleged to be involved is owned and operated by my goddaughter dark brows lifted but the eyes beneath them betrayed nothing justice winslows daughter its generally believed that jessica knows nothing of the illegal use of her shop if indeed there is illegal use dodson reached for the pen again this time holding it lengthwise between both hands i know shes completely innocent not only because shes my goddaughter he went on anticipating slades thoughts but because i know her shes every bit as honest as her father was jessica cherishes larrys memory and he added carefully setting down the pen she hardly needs the money hardly slade muttered picturing a spoiled heiress with too much time and money on her hands smuggling for kicks he mused a change of pace from shopping and parties and jetsetting the bureaus closing in dodson stated the next few weeks could bring the whole mess down around her ears it might be dangerous for her slade controlled the snort of derision even the shield of ignorance isnt going to protect her once things come to a head if her shops involved ive tried to convince her to come to new york for a visit but his voice trailed off amused exasperation moved over his face jessicas stubborn claims shes too busy she tells me i should come visit her with a shake of his head dodson let out what passed for a sigh i considered it but my presence at this point could jeopardize the investigation however i feel jessica needs protection discreet protection someone trained to deal with the situation who can stay close to her without causing speculation a smile touched his eyes someone who could assist the investigation from the inside slade frowned he liked the conversation less and less taking his time he stubbed out his cigarette and how do you expect me to do that dodson smiled fully he liked the irritation in slades voice as much as the directness jessica will do what i want to a point leaning back in the overstuffed leather chair he relaxed again shes been complaining lately about the mess her librarys in about not having enough time to sort through and catalog im going to call her tell her im sending the son of an old friend of mine and her fathers thats true by the way he added tom and larry knew each other some years back your covers simple enough youre a writer who needs a quiet refuge for a few weeks and in turn youll sort out her library slades eyes had darkened during dodsons casual rundown jurisdiction he began some paperwork dodson interrupted easily it can be taken care of after all its the boys from the bureau wholl make the collar when its time im supposed to play librarian and baby sitter slade gave a snort of disgust look commissioner im that close to wrapping up the bitronelli murder he brought his thumb and forefinger together if youd better be dodson interrupted again but with a hint of steel in his voice the press is having a great time making the nypd look like fools on that one and if youre so close he added before slade could toss back a furious retort you should be able to leave for connecticut in a couple of days the bureau is interested in having a cop on the inside a cop who knows how to keep his eyes and ears open theyve checked you out and agree with my choice terrific slade muttered standing he prowled the room im homicide not robbery youre a cop dodson said shortly yeah babysitting for some snobby little heiress slade thought darkly who was either smuggling for thrills or too dizzy to see what was going on under her nose terrific he muttered again once janice was out of college he thought he could quit the force and concentrate on his writing he was tired of it tired of the misery he came in contact with almost every day of his life tired of the dirt the futility tired of the nasty little pieces of humanity his job forced him to deal with and tired too of seeing the look of relief in his mothers eyes each time he came home with a sigh he resigned himself maybe a couple of weeks in connecticut would be a nice change a change anyway when he demanded as he turned back to face dodson day after tomorrow dodson said smoothly ill give you a complete briefing then ill call jessica and tell her to expect you with a shrug slade went back to his chair to listen chapter contents prev next fall touched the trees and stung the air against a hard blue sky the colors were vibrant passionate the ribbon of road cut through the hills and wound eastward toward the atlantic whipping through the open car windows the wind was chilled and fragrant slade wondered how long it had been since he had smelled that kind of freshness no city smells of sweat and exhaust when his book was accepted perhaps he could move his mother and janice out of the city a home in the country maybe or near the shore it was always when or as soon as he couldnt afford to think if another year on the force another year of scraping up tuition money and then shaking his head slade turned up the radio it wasnt any good thinking of next year he wasnt in connecticut to appreciate the scenery it was just another job and one he resented jessica winslow he mused age twentyseven the only child of justice lawrence winslow and lorraine nordan winslow graduate of radcliffe senior class president shed probably been head cheerleader too he thought with a sneer all buttondowned and ponytailed ralph lauren sweaters and gucci loafers struggling to be open minded he continued his catalog opened the house of winslow four years ago up until two years ago she did the majority of buying herself good excuse to play around in europe he thought as he punched in the car lighter michael adams jessica winslows assistant and current buyer thirtytwo yale graduate figures slade reflected exhaling smoke that rushed out of the open window son of robert and marion adams another prominent connecticut family no firm evidence but someone slade was instructed to keep his eye on he leaned his elbow on the window as he considered as chief buyer adams would be in a perfect position to handle the operation from overseas david ryce shop assistant for eighteen months twentythree son of elizabeth ryce the winslow housekeeper dodson had said he was often trusted with running the shop alone that would give him the opportunity to handle the local operation systematically slade ran through the list of the winslow staff gardener cook housekeeper daily maid good god he thought in disgust all that for one person she probably wouldnt know how to boil an egg if her life depended on it the gates to the winslow estate stood open with room enough for two cars to pass easily slade turned into the long macadam drive lined with bushy bloomless azaleas there was a burst of birdsong then silence he drove nearly a quarter of a mile before pulling up in front of the house it was large but he had to admit not oppressively so the brick was old mellowed by sun and sea air smoke rose from one of the chimneys on the hipped roof the gray shutters werent just decorative he noted but could be used for practical purposes if a storm rose up off the sound he smelled the chrysanthemums before he saw them the blossoms were huge growing near the base of the house they were rust gold and copper complimenting the violent red of bushes it charmed him as did the lazy odor of woodsmoke this wasnt indolence but peace hed had too little of that shaking off the mood slade walked up the steps to the front door he lifted a fist and knocked hard he hated doorbells in less than a minute the door opened he had to look down quite a distance down to see a tiny middleaged woman with a pleasantly ugly face and graystreaked hair he caught a whiff of a pinescented cleaner that reminded him of his mothers kitchen may i help you the accent was broad new england im james sladerman miss winslows expecting me the woman scrutinized him with cautious black eyes youd be the writer she stated obviously not overly impressed stepping back she allowed him to enter as the door closed behind him slade glanced around the hall the floor was uncarpeted a gleaming blond oak that showed some wear under the careful polishing a few paintings hung on the ivorytoned wallpaper a pale green glass bowl sat on a high round table and overflowed with fall flowers there were no overt displays of wealth but wealth was there hed seen a print of the painting to his right in an art book the blue scarf that hung negligently over the railing of the steps was silk slade started to turn back to the housekeeper when a clatter at the top of the steps distracted him she came barrelling down the curved staircase in a flurry of swirling blond hair and flying skirts the hammer of heels on wood disrupted the quiet of the house slade had a quick impression of speed motion and energy betsy you make david stay in bed until that fevers broken dont you dare let him get up damn damn damn im going to be late where are my keys three inches away from slade she came to a screeching halt almost overbalancing automatically he reached for her arm to steady her breathless she brought her eyes from his shirt front to stare at him it was an exquisite face fair skinned oval delicate with just a hint of cheekbone that added a rather primitive strength indian viking he wondered celtic her eyes were large the color of aged whiskey set below brows that were lowered in curiosity the faintest line appeared between them a stubborn line slade reflected his sister had one she was small he noted the top of her head barely skimmed his shoulder her scent was reminiscent of fall something musky blossoms and smoke the arm beneath his hand was slender under a thin wool blazer he felt the stir inside him man for woman and hastily dropped his hand this is mr sladerman betsy announced that writer oh yes the smile cleared away the faint line between her brows uncle charlie told me you were coming it took slade a moment to connect uncle charlie with dodson not knowing if he was smothering an oath or a laugh he accepted her extended hand charlie told me you could use some help miss winslow help she rolled her eyes and cleared her throat yes you could call it that the library look im sorry to rush off the minute you get here but my assistants ill and my buyers in france tilting her wrist she grimaced at her watch i have a client coming to the shop ten minutes ago dont worry about it if this frazzled lady can run a business ill volunteer to walk a beat he decided but gave her an easy smile itll give me a chance to get settled in fine ill see you at dinner then glancing around she muttered again about keys in your hand slade told her stupid with a sigh jessica uncurled her fingers and stared at the keys in her palm the more i have to rush the worse it gets lifting amused eyes to his she brushed her hair from her shoulders please dont bother with the library today it may shock you so much that youll run away before i can smooth things over betsy as she dashed for the door jessica looked over her shoulder tell david hes fired if he gets out of bed bye the door slammed behind her betsy clucked her tongue ten minutes later slade inspected his suite of rooms they were nearly as large as the apartment he had grown up in there was a faded carpet on the bedroom floor that he recognized was not old but antique in a small black marble fireplace wood was neatly laid for burning crossing to the sitting room he saw a sturdy desk topped with a vase of the chrysanthemums a brass paperweight and a feather quill without hesitation he cleared it off to make room for his typewriter if he had his way his writing would be more than a cover when he wasnt babysitting hed get some work done of course there was the library to fool with on an exasperated sigh slade turned his back on his typewriter and went back downstairs he roamed filing the position and layout of rooms in the cops part of his mind their descriptions in the writers in his tour of the first floor slade could find no fault with jessicas taste it was only the nouveau riche who went in for ostentation the winslow woman preferred muted colors and clean lines in her clothes too he mused remembering how she had looked in the duncolored blazer and skirt still the blouse shed worn had been a deep almost violent green that just might indicate something else slade stopped to run his fingers over the surface of a rosewood piano compared to this he mused the battered upright his mother treasured was so much kindling with a shrug he wandered to the next door the library he caught the scent of old leather and dust as he looked on the largest private collection of books hed ever seen for the first time since he had walked into dodsons office slade felt a stir of pleasure a quick study told him that the books were well read as well as carelessly filed he crossed the room and mounted the two stairs to the second level not filed at all he corrected but simply jumbled he ran a long finger along a row of volumes robert burns tilted onto a copy of kurt vonnegut a big job he concluded one he might have enjoyed if it had been his only purpose he took one long look around before absently pulling out a book there was nothing he could do about jessica winslow at the moment he thought as he settled down to read jessica swerved into the parking area beside her shop relieved to see it empty she was late but her client was later or she thought with a frown hed grown tired of waiting and left with a halfhearted oath she hurried to unlock the front door quickly she went from window to window letting the shades snap up without slackening pace she headed for the back room tossed her purse aside then filled a small kettle with water she gave the struggling ivy in the rear window a quick douse before setting the kettle on the stove halfway out of the room she went back to turn the burner on underneath it satisfied she wandered into the main shop it wasnt large but then jessica had never intended it to be intimate personal yes it was that she thought with her signature on it the shop was more than a business to her it was an accomplishment and a love the business end invoices filing books she ran meticulously all of her organizational efforts went into the shop which perhaps was the reason for her lack of order elsewhere the shop was the focus of her life and had been since shed conceived of it initially shed needed something to give some purpose to her life after college was behind her the idea for the shop had germinated slowly then had grown and developed jessica had too much drive too much energy to drift once she had decided to start a business shed moved quickly then that same drive and energy had made it work it turned a profit the money itself meant little but the fact that her shop made it meant everything shed spent six months scouring new england then europe for the right pieces a large inventory hadnt been her goal but an exclusive one after her opening the response had begun as a small trickle mostly friends and friends of friends justice winslows daughter running a shop had brought out the curiosity seekers as well jessica hadnt minded a client was a client and a satisfied one the best advertising for the first two years shed run the shop alone indeed she had never considered that her business would outgrow her when it had shed hired michael adams to handle the overseas buying he was charming capable and knowledgeable the women customers adored him gradually their relationship had mellowed from business to friendship to easy affection as business had continued to thrive jessica had hired david ryce hed been hardly more than a boy at loose ends bored enough to find trouble if it got in the way jessica had hired him because theyd grown up together then she had come to depend on him he was quick with figures and tireless with details he had a streak of street sense that made him a good man to have in business street sense jessica mused james sladerman odd that the term would bring him back to her mind even in that quick exchange at the foot of the stairs shed felt something in him it told her he was a man who would know how to handle himself in business maybe in an alley definitely with a half laugh she stuck her hands in her pockets now why should she think that the fingers that had gripped her arm had been strong his build had been wiry but no it had been his eyes she thought there was something hard in his eyes yet she hadnt been repelled or frightened but drawn even when hed looked at her for those first three or four seconds with that intensity that seemed to creep beneath her skin she hadnt been afraid safe she realized hed made her feel safe that was odd jessica decided catching her bottom lip between her teeth why should she suddenly feel safe when she had no need for protection the door of the shop jingled open pushing speculation aside jessica turned miss winslow i apologize im very late dont give it a thought mr chambers jessica considered telling him that shed also been late then decided against it what he didnt know wouldnt hurt him behind her the kettle whistled im just making tea why dont you join me before we look over the new snuffboxes chambers removed a rather fussy hat from a balding head wonderful i do appreciate you calling me when you get a new shipment in he smiled revealing good dentures you dont think id let anyone see the snuffboxes before you in the kitchen jessica poured boiling water into cups michael found these in france there are two i think youll be particularly interested in he preferred the ornate jessica thought with a smile as she lifted the tray he loved the foolishly gaudy little boxes that men with lace cuffs used to carry she glanced at chambers stubby form and wondered if he pictured himself as a cavalier or perhaps a regency buck still his fascination with snuffboxes had made him a regular customer who had more than once recommended her shop to other people and he was rather sweet in his fussy little way she thought as she placed the tea tray on a table sugar she asked him ah i shouldnt chambers patted his ample middle but perhaps one cube his glance flicked briefly down to her legs as jessica crossed them a pity he thought with an inward sigh that he wasnt twenty years younger later he left happily with two eighteenthcentury snuffboxes before jessica could file the invoice she heard the grumble of an engine glancing up she saw the large delivery truck pull in front of the shop she read the company logo on the side of the steel doors and frowned a bit she could have sworn the delivery that michael was shipping wasnt due until the following day when she recognized the driver jessica waved then walked to the front door to meet him hi miss winslow hello don she accepted the itemized list he handed her muttering about not expecting him until tomorrow he shrugged mr adams put a rush on it mmm she jiggled the keys in her pocket as she scanned the list well he seems to have outdone himself this time and another delivery on saturday i dont oh her eyes lit up with pleasure as they fixed on one item the writing desk the queen anne i meant to tell michael to keep his eyes open for one then forgot it must be fate of course she should uncart it first at least take a look no impulses were the best jessica decided smiling she looked back up at the driver the rest comes in here but that goes to my home would you mind well it was easy to justify using the smile jessica could already see the desk in the front parlor if its not too much trouble she added the driver shifted to his other foot i guess itll be all right joe wont mind he jerked his thumb at his partner who had opened the wide double doors of the truck thanks i really appreciate it that desk is just what ive been looking for feeling triumphant jessica went to the back room for more tea as she had burst out hours before jessica burst in through the front door of the house betsy she slung her purse over the newel post did it come without waiting for an answer she dashed toward the front parlor since you were six ive been telling you to slow down betsy came through the parlor doors intercepting her at least then you wore sensible shoes betsy jessica gave her a quick hard squeeze that held as much impatience as affection did it come yes of course it came the housekeeper straightened her apron with a tug and its sitting in the parlor just like you told me itll be there whether you walk sensibly or run like a fool the last of the sentence was wasted as jessica was already rushing by her oh its lovely gently she ran a finger over the wood then quickly began to examine it on all sides it was a delicate airy little piece a womans desk jessica opened the slant top then sighed at the unmarred interior really lovely wait until david sees it she opened one of the inner drawers it slid out smoothly its exactly what ive been looking for what luck that michael came across it crouching she ran a hand down one of its slender legs its pretty betsy admitted thinking that the carving would be one more thing to keep dust out of i bet you could have sold it for a pretty penny too the advantage of owning a shop is being able to cop some of the merchandise for yourself rising jessica shut the lid again now all she needed was a frivolous little inkwell or perhaps a porcelain box to set on top of it suppers nearly ready oh supper shaking her head jessica brought herself back to the moment mr sladerman ive neglected him all day is he upstairs in the library betsy announced grimly all day wouldnt even come out for lunch oh boy jessica combed a hand through her hair he hadnt looked like a man who would have much patience with disorganization i really wanted to ease him into that well im going to go be charming so we dont lose him whats for supper she asked over her shoulder stuffed pork chops and mashed potatoes that should help jessica muttered as she headed for the library door she opened it slowly enough to stick her head inside some things she decided you dont rush into he was sitting at a long work table surrounded by pillars and piles of books a thick pad was in front of him and the pencil in his hand was worked halfway down his hair fell over his forehead but she could see his brows drawn together in concentration or annoyance she mused she put on her best smile hi he looked up eyes pinning her jessica could feel the little prickles of power all over her skin she absorbed it intrigued by the sensation without being aware of it her smile had faded into a look of puzzlement who is this man she wondered it was curiosity as much as courage that had her coming all the way into the room the lamp on the desk slanted across his face highlighting his mouth and putting his eyes in shadow she didnt feel safe with him this time but unsettled she continued toward him youve got a hell of a mess here slade said shortly tossing his pencil aside it was better to attack than let himself dwell on how beautiful she was if you run your shop like this he gestured widely its a miracle youre not bankrupt the specific complaint eased the tension in her shoulders thered been nothing personal in that look she assured herself shed been foolish to think there had been i know its terrible jessica admitted smiling again i hope youre not going to do the sensible thing and walk out gingerly she lowered a hip to the table before lifting a book at random do you like challenges mr sladerman she was laughing he noted or her eyes were but he sensed very clearly that she laughed at herself a reluctant smile tugged at his mouth as he struggled to study her objectively maybe she was innocent maybe not he didnt have the same blind faith as the commissioner but she was beautiful and he was attracted slade decided the attraction was going to be difficult to work around letting out a long breath he gazed around the room how much choice did he have im going to take pity on you miss winslow i have a fondness for books so do i she began then had to deal with another of his cool direct looks really she claimed with a laugh im just not neat do we have a deal mr sladerman solemnly she offered her hand he glanced at it first soft and elegant he thought like her name and her voice with a quick curse at fate for making the commissioner her godfather slade took her hand in his we have a deal miss winslow jessica slid from the table keeping his hand in hers when he would have drawn away somehow shed known it would be hard and strong how do you feel about stuffed pork chops they were tender and delicious slade ate three after his stomach remembered the lack of lunch and he thought after a slice of cheesecake this case had some advantages over the one hed just wrapped up for two weeks hed made do on cold coffee and stale sandwiches and his partner hadnt been as easy to look at as jessica winslow shed guided the conversation expertly during the meal and had ended by tucking her arm through his to lead him back to the parlor have a seat she invited ill pour you a brandy as he started to cross the room the desk caught his eye that wasnt here this morning what with a decanter in her hand she glanced over her shoulder oh no it just came this afternoon do you know anything about antiques no he gave the desk a cursory study before taking a chair ill leave that to you miss winslow jessica she poured a second brandy before crossing to him do i call you james or jim slade he told her as he took a snifter even my mother stopped calling me jim when i was ten you have a mother the quick unconscious surprise in her voice had him grinning everybodys entitled to one feeling foolish jessica sat across from him you just seem to be capable of arranging the whole business without one both sipped brandy and their eyes met over the snifters jessica felt the moment freeze out of time out of place do minds touch she thought numbly wasnt she sensing at that moment the turbulent spin of his thoughts or were they hers brandy slipped hot and strong down her throat snapping her back talk she ordered herself say something do you have any other family she managed slade stared at her wondering if he had imagined that instant of stunning intimacy hed never felt that with any woman before any lover it was ridiculous to imagine that hed felt it with one he barely knew a sister he said at length shes in college a sister jessica relaxed again and slipped out of her shoes thats nice i always wanted a brother or sister when i was growing up money cant buy everything slade shrugged with the words seeing the puzzled hurt on her face he cursed himself if she was getting to him already what would it be like in a week youre quick with clichés jessica observed i suppose thats because youre a writer after another sip of brandy she set the glass aside what do you write unpublished novels she laughed as she had in the library drawing another smile from him it must be frustrating only daily he agreed why do you do it why do you eat jessica considered for a moment then nodded yes i suppose its like that isnt it have you always wanted to write he thought of his father how he had bragged that his son would be the next sladerman on the force he thought of his teenage years when he had written his stories in longhand in spiral notebooks late into the night he thought of his fathers eyes the first time he had seen his son in uniform and he thought of the first time hed had a short story accepted yes perhaps it was easier to admit to her what he had never been able to explain to his family always when you want something badly enough and you dont give up jessica began slowly you get it slade gave a short laugh before he drank always she touched the tip of her tongue to her top lip almost always its all a gamble isnt it long odds he murmured frowning into his glass i usually play long odds he studied the amber liquor which was almost exactly the shade of her eyes she shouldnt be so easy to talk to he mused hed find himself saying too much ah ulysses i wondered where you were lifting his eyes slade stared at a large loping mop of fur it lunged unerringly into jessicas lap he heard her groan then giggle damn it how many times do i have to tell you youre not a lap dog youre breaking my ribs she twisted her head but the wet pink tongue found her cheek stop she sputtered pushing impotently get down she ordered get down right this minute ulysses barked twice then continued to lap his tongue all over her face what slade asked slowly is that jessica gave another mighty shove but ulysses only rested his head on her shoulder a dog of course theres no of course about that dog hes a great pyrenees she retorted quickly running out of breath and he flunked obedience school three times you mangy softheaded mutt get down ulysses let out a long contented breath and didnt budge give me a hand will you she demanded of slade ill have internal injuries this time once before i was stuck for two hours until betsy got home rising slade approached the dog with a frown does he bite god im suffocating and the man asks if he bites a grin split slades face as he looked down at her cant be too careful about these things he might be vicious jessica narrowed her eyes sic em ulysses hearing his name the dog roused himself to lick her face again joyfully satisfied jessica demanded now grab him somewhere and get me out bending slade wrapped his arms around the bulk of fur the back of his hand brushed jessicas breast as he shifted his grip sorry he muttered dragging at the dog good god what does he weigh about one twentyfive i think with a shake of his head slade put his back into it ulysses slid to the floor to lay adoringly at jessicas feet taking a deep gulp of air jessica closed her eyes she was covered with loose white hair her own was disheveled and curled around her shoulders the color slade observed of sunbleached wheat with her face in repose the slant of her cheekbones was more pronounced her lips were just parted their shape was utterly feminine the classic cupids bow but for the fullness in the lower lip it spoke of passion hidden quietly simmering passion the mouth and the cheekbones added something to the tearoom looks that had slades pulse responding he couldnt want her he told himself that wasnt just irresponsible it was stupid he stared down at the dog again you should do something about training him he said shortly i know with a sigh jessica opened her brandycolored eyes her affection for ulysses made her forget the discomfort and the mess he usually created hes very sensitive really i just havent got the heart to subject him to obedience school again thats incredibly stupid slade tossed back hes too big not to be trained want the job jessica retorted straightening in the chair she began to brush at stray dog hair ive got one thanks why should it annoy her that he hadnt once used her name she asked herself as she rose dignity had to be sacrificed as she stepped over the now sleeping dog i appreciate the help she said stiffly and the advice is duly noted slade shrugged off the sarcasm no problem you struck me as more the poodle type though really for a moment jessica merely studied his eyes yes they were hard she decided hard and cool and cynical and i have the impression you dont think much of the poodle type help yourself to the brandy im going up chapter contents prev next for the next two days there was an uneasy truce perhaps it lasted that long because jessica made a point of staying out of slades way he in turn stayed out of hers while patiently noting her routine which he discovered was no routine at all she simply never stopped she didnt take time for the social rigamarole he had expected luncheons clubs committees but worked apparently inexhaustibly most of her time was spent at the shop at the rate he was going he knew he would find out little in the house his next move was the house of winslow it followed that he needed to make peace with jessica to get there from his bedroom window he watched her drive away it was barely eight oclock a full hour before she normally left slade swore in frustration how did the commissioner expect him to watch her or protect her if thats what she needed if she was always in one place while he was in another it was time to improvise an excuse to pay her a visit at her place of business grabbing a jacket on the way slade headed for the stairs he could always claim that he wanted to do a bit of research on antique furniture for his novel that would buy him a few hours as well as give him a reason to poke around before hed rounded the last curve in the steps he heard betsys voice nothing but trouble dont fuss slade stopped waiting as the footsteps came his way there was a tall gangly man walking down the hall his mop of dark blond hair was long and straight cut rather haphazardly just below the collar of a chambray workshirt he wore jeans and wirerim glasses and stood hunched over a bit either from habit or fatigue because he was staring down at his sneakers he didnt see slade his face was pale and the eyes behind the lenses were shadowed david ryce slade concluded and kept silent i told you she said you werent to come in today betsy bustled after him a feather duster gripped in her hand im fine if i lie around in bed another day im going to mold he coughed violently fine fine indeed betsy clucked her tongue swinging the duster at his back mom lay off exasperated david started to turn back to her when he spotted slade he frowned choking back another cough oh you must be the writer thats right slade came down the last two steps just a boy he thought taking davids measure quickly who hasnt completely thrown off the youthful defiance jessie and i figured youd be a short stooped little guy with glasses i dont know why he grinned but slade noted that he placed a hand on the newel post for support getting anywhere with the library slowly better you than me david murmured wishing for a chair has jessica come down yet shes already gone slade told him there you see betsy folded her arms over her chest and if you go in shell just send you right back home thunder at you too because his legs threatened to buckle david gripped the newel post harder shes going to need help with the new shipment anothers due in today lotta good youd do betsy began catching the look in davids eye slade cut in i was thinking about running down there myself id like to see the place maybe do a little research i could give her a hand he watched david struggle caught between his desire to go to the shop and his need to lie down shell try to move everything herself he muttered thats the truth betsy agreed apparently switching her annoyance from her son to her employer nothing stops that one its my job to move in the new stock check it off i dont moving furniture around shouldnt require any great knowledge of antiques slade put in casually knowing it was too perfect to let pass he slipped into his jacket and since i was heading that way anyway there its settled betsy announced she had her son by the elbow before he could protest mr sladerman will go look out for miss jessica you go back to bed im not going back to bed a chair all i wants a chair he sent slade a weak smile hey thanks tell jessie im coming back on monday the paperwork oh the new stock can wait over the weekend tell her to humor the invalid and leave it for me slade nodded slowly sure ill tell her turning he started out deciding that the new stock interested him very much fifteen minutes later slade parked in the small graveled lot beside jessicas shop it was a small framed building fronted with several narrow windows the shades were up through the glass he could see her tugging on a large and obviously heavy piece of furniture cursing women in general he walked to the front door and pulled it open at the jingle of bells she spun around that anyone would be by the shop at that hour surprised her that slade stood inside the door frowning at her surprised jessica more well the physical exertion had winded her so that she struggled to even her breathing i didnt expect to see you here she didnt add that she wasnt particularly pleased either shed stripped off her jacket and pushed up the sleeves of her cashmere sweater beneath it small high breasts rose and fell agitatedly slade remembered their softness against the back of his hand very clearly he forgot hed come to make peace with her dont you have more sense than to push this stuff around yourself he demanded with a quick oath he pulled off his jacket and tossed it over a chair jessica stiffened her back as well as her tone well good morning to you too her annoyance rolled off of him after crossing to her slade leaned against the large piece shed been struggling with where do you want it he asked shortly and i hope to god youre not one of those women who changes her mind a half dozen times he watched her eyes narrow and darken as they had that night in the parlor oddly he found her only more attractive when she was agitated if it hadnt been for that the way her chin jutted out might have amused him i dont believe anyone asked for your assistance for the first time he was treated to the ice in her tone im capable of arranging my stock myself dont be any more stupid than necessary he shot back youre just going to hurt yourself now where do you want this thing this thing she began heatedly is a nineteenthcentury french secretaire he gave it a negligent glance yeah so where do you want me to put it ill tell you where you can put it his laughter cut her off it was very male and full of fun it wasnt a sound she had expected from him with an effort she swallowed a chuckle of her own as she stepped back from him the last thing she wanted was to find anything appealing about james sladerman over there she said coolly pointing turning away jessica picked up a washstand to carry it in the opposite direction when the sounds of wood sliding over wood had stopped she turned back to him thank you the gratitude was short and cold now what can i do for you he treated himself to a lengthy look at her she stood very straight her hands folded loosely her eyes still dangerous two motherofpearl combs swept her hair back from her face he allowed his gaze to sweep down briefly she was very slender with a handspanable waist and barely any hips the trim flannel skirt hid most of her legs but slade could appreciate what was visible from the knees down her feet were very small one of them tapped the floor impatiently ive thought about that from time to time he commented as his eyes roamed back to hers but i came by to see what i could do for you ryce was worried that you might do just what you were trying to do a few minutes ago youve seen david her cool impatience evaporated swiftly jessica crossed the room to take slades arm was he up how is he suddenly he wanted to touch her her hair her face shed be soft he felt an almost desperate need for something soft and yielding her eyes were on his wide with concern he was up he said briefly and not as well as he wanted to be he shouldnt have been out of bed no probably not did her hair carry that scent he wondered that autumnwoods fragrance that was driving him mad he wanted to come in this morning come in jessica pounced on the two words i gave specific orders for him to stay home why cant he do as hes told slades eyes were suddenly keen on her face does everyone do what you tell them hes my employee she retorted dropping her hand from his arm he damn well better do what i tell him as quickly as she had flared up her mood shifted and she smiled hes hardly more than a boy really and betsy nags at him its just her way though i appreciate his dedication to the business hes got to get well her eyes drifted to the phone on the counter if i call hell just get defensive he said he wouldnt come in until monday slade leaned against the secretaire he wanted you to leave the paperwork on the new shipments for him jessica stuck her hands in her pockets obviously still toying with the idea of phoning to lecture david yes all right if hes going to come in on monday at least hell be sitting down ill get the new stock situated in the meantime so hes not tempted she smiled again hes nearly as obsessed with this place as i am if i so much as move a candlestick david knows it before he got sick he was trying to talk me into a vacation she laughed tossing her head so that her hair swung behind her he just wanted the place to himself for a week or two a very dedicated assistant slade murmured oh davids that jessica agreed what are you doing here slade i thought youd be buried in books half glad half wary that the reserve of the last few days had vanished he gave her a cautious smile i told david id give you a hand that was very nice the surprise in her voice had his smile widening i can be nice occasionally he returned besides i thought i might be able to get some information on antiques research oh she accepted this with a nod all right i wouldnt mind having some help with the heavier things what period were you interested in period furniture jessica explained as she walked to a long low chest is there a particular century or style renaissance early american italian provincial just a general sort of lesson today to give me the feel of it slade improvised as he nudged jessica away from the chest where do you want this he lifted and carried jessica arranged the lighter pieces while keeping up a running dialog on the furniture they moved this chair was chippendale see the square tapered seat and cabriole leg this cabinet was french baroque in satinwood gilded and carved she ran over a little table with a polishing cloth explaining about chinese influences and tea services during the morning they were interrupted half a dozen times by customers jessica turned from antique lover to salesperson slade watched her show pieces explain their background then dicker over prices if he hadnt been sure before he was certain now her shop was no toy to her she not only knew how to manage it but worked harder than hed given her credit for not only did she handle people with a deft skill he was forced to admire but she made money if the discreet price tags hed come across were any indication so why he wondered if she was dedicated to her shop if she turned a profit would she risk using her business for smuggling now that hed met her and spent some time with her it wasnt as easy for slade to dismiss it as kicks or thrills yet she wasnt lacking in brains was it plausible that an operation was going on under her nose without her knowledge slade i hate to ask jessica kept her voice lowered as she came close to his side touching came naturally to her it seemed for her hand was already on his arm irresponsible or not he discovered that he wanted her turning he trapped her effectively between the chest and himself her hand remained on his arm just below the elbow though they touched in no other way he suddenly had a very clear sensation of how her body would feel pressed against his his eyes brushed over her mouth then came to hers ask what her mind went blank some sound filled her head like an echo of surf pounding on the shore she could have stepped back an inch and broken the contact stepped forward an inch to consummate it jessica did neither dimly she was aware of a pressure in her chest as though someone were pressing hard against it to cut off her air in that instant they both knew he had only to touch her for everything to change slade she murmured half question half invitation he snapped back retreating from the edge from an involvement he couldnt afford did you want me to move something else his voice was cool as he stepped away from her shaken jessica backed toward the chest she needed distance mrs mackenzie wants to take the chifforobe with her shes gone out to pull her car to the front would you mind putting it in the back of her station wagon all right she indicated the piece with a silent gesture not moving until he was out the front door with it alone jessica allowed herself a long uneasy breath that was not a man a woman should lose control with she warned herself he wouldnt be gentle or particularly kind she placed the flat of her palm on her chest as if to relieve the pressure that lingered there dont overreact the next time she advised herself its the way he looks at me jessica decided as if he could see what im thinking she ran an unsteady hand through her hair i dont even know what im thinking when he looks at me so how could he and yet and yet her pulse was still racing when the door jingled open again she hadnt budged from her spot in front of the chest of drawers im starved she improvised swiftly then started to move as slade watched she hurried from window to window lowering shades she hung a sign on the door and then locked it you must be too she said when he remained silent its after one and ive had you dragging furniture around all morning how about a sandwich and some tea slade managed to smile and sneer at the same time tea her laughter eased her own tension no i suppose not well david keeps some beer she hustled to the back of the shop and pulled open the door of a small refrigerator she crouched then rummaged here i knew id seen some straightening jessica turned and collided with his chest he took her arms briefly in reflex then as quickly dropped them heart hammering she stepped away sorry i didnt know you were behind me will this do safely at arms length she offered the bottle fine his expression was bland as he took it and sat at the table the tension had settled at the base of his neck hed have to be careful not to touch her again or to give in to the urge to taste that subtly passionate mouth of hers once he did hed never stop there desire tightened a hard ball in the pit of his stomach almost violently slade twisted the cap from the beer ill fix some sandwiches jessica became very busy in the refrigerator roast beef all right yeah thats fine what goes on in his mind she wondered as she kept her hands busy its just not possible to tell what hes thinking she sliced neatly through bread and meat prudently keeping her back to him looking down at her own hands she thought of slades he had such long lean fingers strong shed liked the look of them now she caught herself wondering how they would feel on her body competent experienced demanding the flare of desire was quick but not unexpected this time fighting it she sliced the second sandwich a bit savagely he watched the sunlight stream through the window onto her hair it fell softly on the varied hues of blue in her sweater he liked the way the material clung to her enhancing the straight slender back and narrow waist but he noted too the tension in her shoulders he wasnt going to get very far if they were both preoccupied with an attraction neither wanted he had to make her relax and talk slade knew one certain way of accomplishing that youve got quite a place here jessica he wasnt aware that it was the first time hed said her name but she was that pleased her as much as the careful compliment thank you belatedly she remembered to turn the burner on under the kettle as she brought his sandwich to the table people have finally stopped calling it jessicas little hobby is that what it started out to be not to me she stretched on tiptoe to reach a cup slade watched the hem of her skirt sneak up but to a lot of people it was just justice winslows daughter having a fling at business did you want a glass for that no slade brought the bottle to his lips and drank why antiques it was something i knew something i loved its sensible to make a career out of something you know and appreciate dont you think he thought of the standard policeissue revolver hidden in his bedroom when its possible howd you get started i was lucky enough to have the funds to back me up the first year while i gathered stock and renovated this place the kettle shrilled then sputtered when she switched off the heat even with that it was hard enough setting up books getting licenses learning about taxes she wrinkled her nose as she brought her plate and cup to the table but thats a necessary part of the whole with that the traveling and the selling the first couple of years were killers she bit into her sandwich i loved it she would have he mused he could sense the pentup energy even as she sat there calmly drinking tea david ryce work for you long about a year and a half he was at that undecided point of his life i suppose we all go through when weve finished being teenagers but havent quite grasped adulthood she smiled across the table at slade do you know what i mean more or less you probably less than most she commented easily as it turned out he resented the offer of a job and the fact that he needed one david and i grew up together theres nothing harder on the ego than having big sister give you a break she sighed a bit remembering his moodiness his grudging acceptance his initial lack of interest anyway within six months he stopped being resentful and became indispensable hes very quick particularly with figures david considers the books his province now and hes better with them than the selling angle oh her eyes danced he isnt always diplomatic with customers hes much better with bookkeeping and inventory michael and i can handle the buying and selling michael before he drank again slade repeated the name as though it meant nothing michael does almost all my buying all the imports at any rate you dont buy the stock yourself not from overseas not anymore jessica toyed with the last half of her sandwich if id tried to keep up with it i wouldnt have been able to keep the shop open year round watching out for estate sales and auctions just in the new england area takes me away from the shop enough as it is and michael michael has a real genius for finding gems he wondered if her analogy was fact was michael adams shipping gems as well as hepplewhites across the atlantic michaels been handling that part of the business for nearly three years jessica went on and hes not only a good buyer but a terrific salesman particularly with my female clientele she laughed as she lifted her cup hes very smooth both looks and manner slade noted the affection in her voice and speculated just how much was between owner and buyer he wondered if adams was involved in smuggling and jessicas lover his thoughts trailed off as he looked down at her hands she wore a thin twisted band of gold on her right hand and a starshaped group of opals on her left the sun hit the stones shooting little flames of red into the delicate blue it suited her he thought taking another swig of beer in any case ive gotten spoiled jessica stretched her shoulders with a sigh its been a long time since ive had to run the shop alone ill be glad to have both michael and david back next week i might even take uncle charlie up on his invitation uncle charlie her cup paused halfway to her lips uncle charlie jessica repeated puzzled he sent you slade gave a quick silent oath as he shrugged the commissioner he said blandly i dont think of him as uncle charlie the commissioners awfully formal still frowning at him jessica set down her cup shes not a fool slade concluded as he swung an arm over the back of his chair i always call him that habit dont you like to travel he changed the subject neatly adding a quick disarming smile id think the buying end would be half the fun it can be it can also be a giant headache airports and auctions and customs the line between her brows vanished i have been thinking about combining a business and pleasure trip next spring i want to visit my mother and her husband in france your mother remarried yes its been wonderful for her after my father died she was so lost we both were she murmured and after nearly five years she mused there was still an ache it was dull with time but it was still there theres nothing harder than to lose someone you loved and lived with and depended on especially when you think that person is indestructible then hes taken away with no warning her voice had thickened touching off a chord of response in him i know he answered before he thought her eyes came up and fixed on his do you he didnt like the emotion she stirred up in him my father was a cop he answered curtly he was killed in action five years ago oh slade jessica reached for his hand how terrible how terrible for your mother wives of cops learn to live with the risk he moved his hand back to his beer sensing withdrawal jessica said nothing he wasnt a man to share emotion of any kind easily she rose stacking plates do you want something else i imagine therere cookies stashed around here somewhere she wouldnt probe he realized wouldnt eulogize shed offered him her sympathy then had backed off when shed seen that it wasnt wanted slade sighed it was difficult enough to deal with his attraction to her without starting to like her as well no he rose to help her clear the table when they entered the shop jessica went straight to the door to snap up the shade on the glass slade whirled sharply as he heard her quick cry of alarm it was immediately followed by a laugh mr layton jessica flipped the lock to admit him you scared the wits out of me he was tall well dressed and fiftyish his bankerish suit was offset by a gray silk tie the same color as his hair the rather thin stern face lightened with a smile as he took jessicas hand sorry dear but then you did the same to me glancing past her he gave slade an inquiring look this is james sladerman mr layton hes staying with us for a while davids been ill oh nothing serious i hope just the flu jessica told him but a heavy dose of it she gave him a sudden shrewd smile you always manage to pop in on me when ive just gotten in a shipment ive just managed to get this one arranged and anothers on its way he chuckled a hoarse sound due to his fondness for cuban cigars its more your predictability than chance miss winslow your michaels been in europe for three weeks id asked him to keep an eye out for a piece or two for me before he left oh well the jingle of the door interrupted her mr chambers i didnt expect you back so soon chambers gave her a rather sheepish smile as he removed his hat the box with the pearl inlay he began i cant resist it go on ahead my dear layton gave jessicas shoulder a pat ill just browse for the moment pretending an interest in a collection of pewter slade watched both men layton browsed lingering here and there to examine a piece once he drew out a pair of half glasses and crouched down to study the carving on a table slade could hear jessicas quiet voice as she discussed a snuffbox with chambers he choked back a snort of derision at the idea of a rational man buying anything as ridiculous as a snuffbox after telling jessica to wrap the box chambers turned to fuss over a curio cabinet it was a simple matter for slade to mentally note both mens descriptions and names later he would commit them to paper and call them in whoever they were they appeared to have at least a basic knowledge of antiques at least from what he could glean from their conversation as they both discussed the cabinet wandering to the counter slade glanced down at the ticket jessica was writing up her handwriting was neat feminine and legible one eighteenthcentury snuffbox french with pearl inlay it was the price that had him doing a double take are you kidding he asked aloud ssh she glanced over at her customers saw that they were occupied then sent slade a wicked grin dont you have any vices slade immoral not insane he retorted but the grin had appealed to him he leaned a bit closer do you she let the look hold enjoying the easy humor in his eyes it was the first time shed seen it no she gave a low laugh absolutely none for the first time he reached out to touch her voluntarily just the tip of her hair with the tip of his finger the pen slipped out of jessicas hand are you corruptible he murmured he was still smiling but she no longer felt easy jessica found herself grateful that the counter was between them and there were customers in the shop i wouldnt have thought so she managed laytons hoarse chuckle distracted her coming around the counter jessica walked toward her customers giving slade a wide berth dangerous curves ahead her mind warned one wrong turn with this man and youd be through the guardrail and over the cliff shed been too cautious for too long to be reckless now its a lovely little piece she said to both men it arrived right after youd left the other day mr chambers she was aware though he made no sound when slade turned his attention from her and wandered to the far end of the room in the end chambers bought the cabinet while layton chose what jessica referred to as a fauteuil and a console from the louis xv period slade saw them as a chair and a table too ornate for the average taste but elegant names he imagined equaled elegant prices with customers like that he commented when the shop was empty you could open a place twice this size i could she agreed as she filed the slips but its not what i want and of course not everyone buys as freely those are men who know what they like and can afford to have it its my good fortune that theyve taken to buying it here for the past year or so she watched him poke around opening a drawer here and there until he settled in front of a corner cabinet inside was a collection of porcelain figures lovely arent they she commented as she joined him he kept his back to her though that didnt prevent her scent from creeping into his senses yeah theyre nice she caught her bottom lip between her teeth it wasnt often dresden was described as nice my mother likes things like this ive always thought this was the best in the collection jessica opened the door and drew out a small delicate shepherdess i nearly whisked her away for myself slade frowned at it she does have a birthday and a thoughtful son her eyes were dancing when he lifted his to them how much he said flatly jessica ran her tongue over her teeth it was bargaining time there was nothing she liked better twenty dollars she said impulsively he laughed shortly im not stupid jessica how much when she tilted her head the stubborn line appeared between her brows twentytwo fifty thats my last offer reluctantly he smiled youre crazy take it or leave it she said with a shrug its your mothers birthday after all its worth a hell of a lot more than that it certainly would be to her jessica agreed frustrated slade stuck his hands in his pockets and frowned at the figurine again twentyfive he said sold before he could change his mind jessica hustled over to the counter and began to box it with a deft move she peeled the price tag from the bottom and dropped it in the trash i can giftwrap if you like she said no charge slowly he walked over to the counter watching as she laid the porcelain in a bed of tissue paper why because its her birthday birthday presents should be wrapped thats not what i mean he put a hand on the box to stop her movements why he repeated jessica gave him a long considering look he didnt like favors she concluded and only took this one because it was for someone he cared for because i want to his brow lifted and his eyes were suddenly very intense do you always do what you want i give it my best shot doesnt everyone before he could answer the door opened again delivery for you miss winslow slade felt a stir of excitement as the delivery was offloaded maybe just maybe thered be something he wanted to tie this case up quickly neatly and be gone while he still had some objectivity jessica winslow had a way of smearing the issue they werent a man and woman and he couldnt forget it he was a cop she was a suspect his job was to find out what he could even if it meant turning evidence on her listening to her steady stream of excitement as he uncarted boxes slade thought hed never known anyone who appeared less capable of dishonesty but that was a feeling a hunch he needed facts in his temporary position as mover and hauler he was able to examine each piece carefully he caught no uneasiness from jessica but rather her appreciation for helping her check for damage during shipping the twinge of conscience infuriated him he was doing his job he reminded himself and it was her damn uncle charlie that had put him there another year slade told himself again another year and thered be no commissioner to hand him special assignments as a baby sitter cum spy for goddaughters with amber eyes he found nothing his instinct had told him he wouldnt but slade could have used even a crumb to justify his presence she never stopped moving for the two hours it took to unload the shipment jessica was everywhere polishing arranging dragging out empty crates when there was nothing more to do she looked around for more thats it slade told her before she could decide that something might be shown to a better advantage somewhere else i guess youre right absently she rubbed at the small of her back its a good thing those three pieces are being shipped out monday its a bit crowded hey im starving she turned to him with an apologetic smile i didnt mean to keep you so long slade its after five without giving him a chance to comment she dashed to the back room for their jackets here ill close up how about a hamburger and a movie he said impulsively im just keeping an eye on her he told himself thats what im here to do surprised jessica glanced around as she pulled down the last shade from the look on his face she thought amused he was already half regretting having asked but that was no reason to let him off the hook what a romantic invitation how can i refuse you want romance he countered well go to a drivein movie he heard her quick gurgle of laughter as he grabbed her hand and pulled her outside it was late when the phone rang the seated figure reached for it and a cigarette simultaneously hello wheres the desk the desk frowning he brought the flame to the tip and drew its with the rest of the shipment of course youre mistaken the voice was soft and cold ive been to the shop myself it has to be there a flutter of panic rose in his throat jessica just hasnt unpacked it yet possibly youll clear this up immediately i want the desk and its contents by wednesday the pause was slight you understand the penalty for mistakes chapter contents prev next jessica woke thinking of him she took time on the lazy sunday morning to ponder the very odd saturday she had spent most of it with slade a moody man she mused stretching her arms toward the ceiling by turns she had been comfortable with him exasperated by him and attracted to him no that wasnt quite true she amended even when shed been comfortable or exasperated shed been attracted there was something remote about him that made her want to pry him open a bit shed put quite a lot of effort into that the evening before and had come up with nothing he wasnt a man for divulging secrets or bothering with small talk he was an odd combination of the direct and the aloof he didnt flatter not by looks or words and yet she felt certain that he wasnt indifferent to her it wasnt possible that shed imagined those moments of physical pull theyd been there for him as well as for her but he had guards she thought with quick frustration shed never known a man with such guards those dark intense eyes of his clearly said keep back arms length while the challenge of piercing his armor appealed to her her own instinctive awareness of what the consequences would be held her back jessica enjoyed a dare but she usually figured the odds first in this case she decided they were stacked against her a nice cautious friendship was in order she concluded anything else spelled trouble rising she picked up her robe and headed for the shower but wouldnt it be nice she thought to feel that rather hard mouth on hers just once downstairs slade was closeted in the library hed been up since dawn she was crowding his mind what crazy impulse had prompted him to ask her out the night before after downing his fourth cup of coffee slade lit a cigarette for gods sake he didnt have to date the woman to do his job she was getting to him he admitted as he pushed a pile of books aside that low musical laugh and all that soft blond hair it was more than that he thought ruefully it was her she was too close to possessing all the things hed ever wanted in a woman warmth generosity intelligence and that steamy almost primitive sexuality you could sense just under the surface if he kept thinking of her that way it was going to cloud his objectivity even now he was finding himself trying to work out a way to keep her out of the middle when slade drew on the cigarette his eyes were hard and opaque hed protect her when the time came expose her if it came to that but there was no way to keep her out of it still over the mix of leather and dust and smoke he thought he caught a lingering trace of her scent after evading the cooks admonishment to put something in her stomach jessica drank a hurried cup of coffee wheres david she called out when she spotted betsy armed with a rag and a bottle of silver polish he took a walk down to the beach his mother harrumphed a bit but added he looks better i guess the airll do him good ill grab a jacket and check on him long as he doesnt know thats what youre up to betsy jessica feigned offense im much too good for that as the housekeeper snorted the doorbell sounded go ahead jessica told her ill get it she made a dash for the door michael with pleasure she threw her arms around his neck its good to have you back slade came into the hall in time to see jessica embraced and kissed with that low promising laugh she pressed her cheek against the cheek of a slender darkhaired man with smooth features and light green eyes michael adams slade concluded after conquering the urge to stride up to the couple and yank them apart the description fit he caught the gleam of a diamond on the mans pinky as he ran his hand through jessicas hair soft hands and a sunlamp tan slade thought instantly ive missed you darling michael drew jessica back far enough to smile into her face she laughed again touching a hand to his cheek before she stepped out of his arms knowing you michael you were too busy with business and other things to miss anyone how many broken hearts did you leave in europe i never break them michael claimed before brushing her lips again and i did miss you come inside and tell me everything she ordered while tucking her arm through his the stock you sent back is wonderful as always ive already sold oh hello slade the moment jessica turned she saw him quickly potently his eyes locked on hers she had to use all of her strength of will not to draw in her breath was there a demand in them she wondered a question confused she gave a slight shake of her head what was it he wanted from her and why was she ready to give it without even knowing what it was jessica there was a faint smile on his face as he waited michael this is james sladerman hes staying with us for a while and trying to make some order out of the library no small job from what ive seen of it michael commented i hope youve got plenty of time enough knowing the housekeeper would be close enough to eavesdrop jessica stepped away from michael and called her betsy could we have coffee in the parlor slade youll join us she had expected him to refuse but he gave her a slow smile sure he didnt have to look at michael to see the annoyance before they walked into the parlor why jessica whats the queen anne doing here fate she told him then laughed as she sat on the sofa id meant to ask you to find one for me when i saw it on the shipping list i wondered if you were psychic after studying it for a moment he nodded it certainly suits this room he sat next to jessica as slade settled in an armchair no problem with the shipments no theyre already unpacked as a matter of fact three pieces go out tomorrow davids been ill this past week slade helped me get things in order yesterday really michael took out a waferthin gold case then offered slade a cigarette refusing with a shake of his head slade pulled out his own pack do you know antiques mr sladerman no slade struck a match watching michael over the flame unless we count the lesson jessica gave me yesterday michael sat back tossing an arm casually over the back of the sofa what do you do his smooth neat fingers toyed absently with jessicas hair slade took a hard drag on his cigarette im a writer fascinating would i have read any of your work he gave michael a long steady stare i wouldnt think so slade is working on a novel jessica intervened there were undercurrents that made her uncomfortable you havent told me yet what its about he caught the look in her eye recognizing it as a plea for peace not yet he decided well just see what we can stir up smuggling he said flatly there was a loud clatter of china from the doorway damn david took a firmer grip on the tray then gave jessica a sheepish smile i almost dropped the whole works david she sprang up to take the coffee tray from him you can hardly carry yourself much less all this slade watched him give her a disgruntled look before he flopped into a chair david was still pale or had the loss of color come when smuggling had been mentioned slade wondered there was a faint line of sweat on his brow between his mop of hair and his glasses after setting down the tray jessica turned back to him how do you feel david scowled at her dont fuss all right she leaned over until her face was level with his if id known you were going to be such a bad patient id have brought you some crayons and colored paper though he gave her hair a hard tug he grinned get me some coffee and shut up oh yes sir she said meekly when she turned david sent slade a quick wink gotta know how to handle these society types hi michael welcome back reaching in his pocket he found a crumpled pack of cigarettes as he searched for matches his eyes lit on the desk hey whats this one of michaels finds ive already laid claim to jessica told him as she brought him his coffee you can take care of the paperwork next week monday he said firmly eyeing the desk queen anne its lovely isnt it she handed slade a cup before crossing to it opening the lid she showed off the inside slade felt the back of his neck prickle there was a rise in tension he felt it could nearly smell it shifting his eyes from jessica he studied both men michael added cream to his coffee david found his match with a half shrug slade told himself he was getting jumpy and wait until you see the rest of the stock jessica told david as she came back to the sofa michael outdid himself slade let the conversation hum around him answering briefly if he was asked a direct question she was crazy about the kid he concluded it showed in the way she teased lightly bullied and catered to him slade remembered her comment about having wanted a brother or sister david was obviously her substitute how far would she go to protect him he wondered all the way flashed through his mind if there was one firm impression hed gotten from jessica winslow it was loyalty her relationship with michael was less defined if they were lovers slade concluded that she was very casual about it somehow he didnt feel jessica would be casual about intimacy passion he thought again there was hot vibrant passion smoldering in that slender little body if michael was her lover slade would have seen some sign of it in the kiss they had exchanged at the door if she had been in his arms it would have been there he thought as his gaze drifted to her mouth it was soft and unpainted from ten feet away he could all but taste it slowly irresistibly desire crept into him and with it an ache a dull throbbing ache hed never felt before if he could have her even once the ache would go slade could almost convince himself of that he needed to touch that buttersoft skin experience that promise of passion then hed be free of her he had to be free of her glancing up jessica found herself trapped again his eyes imprisoned her she could feel herself being pulled as physical a sensation as if he had taken her hand she resisted hes quicksand her mind flashed youll never get away if you take that final step and yet the risk tempted her jessica michael took her hand scattering her thoughts hmm yes how about dinner tonight the little place up the coast you like his calm familiar green eyes smiled at her jessica felt her pulses level this was a man she understood id love to and dont worry about getting home early david put in im minding the shop tomorrow you stay home jessica lifted her brow at the order oh really david snorted at the dry tone there goes miss radcliffe he told slade she forgets i was around when she was twelve and had braces on her teeth how would you like to be flat on your back again she invited sweetly ill be ready at seven she told michael ignoring davids grin fine giving her a quick kiss michael rose see you tomorrow david nice to meet you mr sladerman as he left jessica set down her cup and sprang up as if she had been in one place too long im going to take ulysses for a walk on the beach dont look at me david drawled i have to conserve my energy i wasnt going to ask you slade he would have liked to steer clear of her for a while resigned he rose sure ill get a jacket the beach was long and rocky from off the bay the breeze was keen and tinged with salt jessica was laughing stooping to pick up driftwood and toss it for the dog to chase ulysses bounded up the beach and back again running energetic circles around them until jessica flung another stick to the right water hurled itself on rocks then rose in a misty spray slade watched jessica run to another piece of driftwood doesnt she ever walk he wondered she laughed again holding the stick over her head as the dog leaped clumsily at it dont contact us unless you have something useful slade jammed his hands in his pockets as he remembered his orders watch the woman he was watching the woman damn it and she was getting to him watch what the sunlight does to her hair watch how a pair of faded jeans cling to narrow hips watch how her mouth curves when she smiles watch detective sladerman blow everything because he cant keep his mind off a skinny woman with brandycolored eyes what are you thinking he snapped back to find jessica a step in front of him searching his face cursing himself he realized he was going to blow more than his cover if he wasnt careful that i havent been to the beach in a long time he improvised jessica narrowed her eyes no i dont think so she murmured i wonder what it is about you that makes you so secretive with an impatient gesture she pushed back her hair the wind immediately blew it back in her face but its your business i suppose annoyed he picked up a rock and hurled it into the breakers i wonder what it is about you that makes you so suspicious curious she corrected a bit puzzled by his choice of word youre an interesting man slade perhaps because theres so much you dont say what do you want a biography you annoy easily she murmured he whirled to her dont push it jess the nickname pleased her no one but her father had ever used it the fury on his face pleased her too shed poked the first hole in his shield and if i do she challenged youll get pushed back im not polite she laughed no you damn well arent should that scare me she was baiting him even knowing it didnt help slim and strong she stood in front of him her hair whipped around her face by the wind her eyes were gold and insolent no she wouldnt scare easily slade told himself it was to prove a point even as he yanked her into his arms he told himself it was to prove a point he saw it on her face anticipation acceptance no fear cursing her he brought his mouth down hard on hers it was as he thought it would be soft fragrant pliant she melted like wax in his arms even as his lips bruised hers a man could drown in her the pounding of the surf seemed to echo in his head there was a sensation of standing in the surf having it ebb and suck the sand from under him he dragged her closer her breasts yielded against the hard line of his chest tempting him to explore their shape with his hands but all his power all his concentration was bound up in the pressure of mouth to mouth her hands slid under his jacket up his back pressing urging him to take more head swimming he drew away struggling to separate himself with a long shaky breath jessica dropped her head on his shoulder i nearly suffocated his arms were still around her hed meant to drop them now with her snuggled close her hair brushing his cheek he wasnt certain he could then she tilted her face to his she was smiling youre supposed to breathe through your nose he told her i think i forgot so did i he mused then take a deep breath slade suggested im not nearly finished yet with no less force with no less turbulence his mouth returned to hers this time she was prepared no longer passive jessica made demands of her own her lips parted and her tongue met his searching teasing tasting his flavor was as dark and unsettling as she had imagined greedy she dove deeper she heard his moan felt the sudden race of his heart against her own an urgency filled her so quickly that it took total command there was nothing but him his arms his lips he was all she wanted she had never felt this kind of need or this kind of power even when his lips were brutal she returned the same aggression arousal was too tame a word excitement too bland jessica felt a frenzy a burst of energy that could only be tamed by possession touch me she wanted to scream as her fingers gripped his hair desperately take me its never been like this and i cant bear to lose it she strained against him her gesture as much a demand as an offering he was stronger she knew the sleek hard muscles warned her but his need could be no greater no need could be greater than the one that throbbed in her pounded in her her body felt assaulted both helpless and invulnerable oh show me she thought dizzily ive waited so long to really know a gull screamed overhead like a spray of ice water it jolted slade back what the hell was he doing he demanded as he pushed jessica away or more to the point what was she doing to him hed lost everything his purpose his identity his sanity in one heady taste of her now she stared at him cheeks flushed with passion eyes dark with it her mouth was moist and swollen from his parted with her breath coming rapidly slade with his name husky on her lips she reached for him roughly he caught her wrist before she could touch him youd better go in there was nothing in his eyes now they were opaque again unreadable he stared down at her with a complete lack of interest for an instant she was too confused to understand hed taken her to the edge to that thin tenuous border then had rudely shoved her back as though she hadnt moved him in the least shame flooded her face with color anger stole in again damn you she whispered turning she dashed for the beach steps and took them two at a time jessica dressed with care there was nothing like the feel of silk against the skin to salve wounded pride turning sideways in front of the fulllength mirror she gave a nod of approval the lines of the dress were simple except for the surprising plunge in the back that dipped just below the waist it didnt bother her conscience that she had chosen the dress more with slade in mind than michael and the color suited her mood a deep imperial purple she swept her hair back from her face with two diamondcrusted pins then let it fall as it chose satisfied jessica grabbed her evening bag and started downstairs she found slade in the parlor tightening a screw in a chippendale commode his hands were lean and competent she remembered the feel of them when theyd run over her body in a quick desperate search well arent you handy jessica stated he glanced up frowned and tightened his grip on the screwdriver did she have to look like that he thought darkly the dress clung everywhere and from the way she walked by him he knew she was aware of it slade turned the screw savagely betsy complained that the handle was loose he muttered jack of all trades she said lightly drink im fixing martinis he started to refuse then made the mistake of looking over at her her back was naked and slim and smooth the silk shifted enticingly as she reached for a bottle of vermouth desire was as breathtaking as a punch in the solar plexus scotch he snapped she smiled over her shoulder rocks straight up drink like a man do you slade oh shed get through that damned indifference jessica vowed and enjoy every minute of it after pouring him three fingers she brought the glass to him he slipped the screwdriver into the back pocket of his jeans and rose keeping his eyes on hers slade took a long slow sip of scotch dress like a woman do you jess determined to rattle him she turned a circle like it did you wear it to stir up adams juices or mine he countered with a provocative smile she turned away to finish the martinis do you think women always dress to stir men up dont they normally i dress for myself after pouring a drink she turned back to regard him over the rim tonight i thought id test a theory he went to her the challenge in her eyes and his own ego made it imperative just as she had anticipated what theory jessica met his angry gaze without faltering do you have any weaknesses slade any achilles heel deliberately he set down his own glass then took hers he felt her stiffen though she didnt back away his fingers circled her neck coaxing her lips to within an inch of his she felt the warm rush of his breath on her skin you could regret finding out jess i wont treat you like a lady she tossed her head back though her heart was hammering she met his eyes with an angry dare who asked you to his fingers tightened her lashes lowered the doorbell rang slade picked up his drink and downed the rest of it your date he said shortly then stalked out of the room slade pulled his car to a halt a short distance away from the restaurant switched off the engine pulled out a cigarette then waited michaels daimler was just being parked by the valet slade would have been more comfortable if he could have slipped inside to keep a closer eye on jessica but that was too risky he saw the car pull up behind him tension pricked at the back of his neck as the driver climbed out to approach his car slade slipped a hand inside his jacket and gripped the butt of his gun a badge was pressed against the window glass slade relaxed as the man rounded the hood to enter by the passenger side sladerman agent brewster gave a quick nod of greeting you follow the lady i follow the man commissioner dodson told you id be in touch yeah greenharts looking after ryce not a lot of action there the guys been laid up for more than a week youve got nothing yet i take it nothing slade shifted to a more comfortable position i spent the day at her shop saturday helped her uncart a new shipment if there was anything in it id swear she didnt know it i had my hands all over everything in that place shes too damn casual to be hiding anything maybe with a weighty sigh brewster pulled out a worn black pipe and began to pack it if that fancy little shops the dump site at least one of ems hiding something maybe all three seems ryce is like baby brother as for adams brewster struck a match and sucked on his pipe slade said nothing well the ladys got the justices name behind her and a lot of political pressure to keep her name clear but if shes involved its going to hit the fan shes not he heard himself say then flipped his cigarette out the window youre in the majority brewster commented easily even if shes as pure as a mothers heart shes in a hell of a spot right now pressures building sladerman the lids going to blow real soon and when it does its going to get ugly winslow might find herself right in the middle dodson seems to think youre good enough to keep her out of the way when it goes down ill take care of her slade muttered i dont like her being alone with adams in there well i missed my dinner brewster touched his rounded stomach ill just go eat on the taxpayers money and keep an eye on your lady shes not my lady slade mumbled the restaurant was quiet and candlelit by the table where jessica sat with michael was a breathtaking view of the sound on the nightblack water there was moonlight and the scattered reflection of stars the murmur of diners was discreet low tones soft laughter the scent of fresh flowers mixed with the aroma of food and candlewax champagne buzzed pleasantly in her head if someone had told her shed been working too hard lately jessica would have laughed but now she was completely relaxed for the first time in over a week im glad you thought of this michael he liked the way the light flickered over her face throwing a mystery of shadows under her cheekbones enhancing the odd golden hue of her eyes why was it she always seemed that much more beautiful when hed been away from her and had he for a dozen foolish reasons waited too long jessica he brought her hand to his lips ive missed you the gesture and the tone of his voice surprised her its good to have you back michael odd that hed always been known for his smooth lines and was now unable to think how to proceed jessica i want you to start coming with me on the buying trips come with you her brow creased why michael youre more than capable of handling that end i hate to admit it but youre much better at it than i i dont want to be away from you again puzzled jessica gave a quick laugh as she squeezed his hand michael dont tell me you were lonely i know theres nothing you like better than zipping around europe hunting up treasures if you were homesick its a first his fingers tightened on hers i wasnt homesick jessica and there was only one thing i was lonely for i want you to marry me surprise was a mild term jessica was stunned and her face was transparent marry she nearly thought she had misunderstood him she could hardly conceive of michael wanting to be married at all but to her theyd been together for nearly three years business associates friends but never jessica you must know how i feel he placed a hand over their joined ones ive loved you for years michael i had no idea oh michael that sounds so trite she ran the fingers of her free hand up and down the stem of her glass i dont know what to say to you say yes michael why now why all of a sudden she stopped the nervous movement of her hand and studied him you never even hinted that you had any feelings for me other than affection do you know how hard its been he asked quietly contenting myself with that jessica you werent ready for my feelings youve been so wrapped up in making a success out of the shop you needed to make a success of it and i wanted to build up my own part of it before i asked you we both needed to be independent it was true all that he said and yet how was she to suddenly stop seeing him as michael her friend her associate and see him as michael her lover her husband i dont know he squeezed her hand either in reassurance or frustration i didnt expect you would so quickly will you think about it yes of course i will and even as she promised the memory of a violent embrace on a windy beach ran through her mind in the late hours the phone rang but it didnt wake him hed been expecting it youve located my property he moistened his lips then dried them again with the back of his hand yes jessica took the desk home theres a small problem i dont like problems cold beads of sweat broke out on his forehead ill get the diamonds out its just that jessicas always around theres no way i can take the desk apart and get them while shes in the house i need some time to convince her to go away for a few days twentyfour hours but thats not thats all the time you have or all the time miss winslow will have sweat coated his lip and he lifted a trembling hand to wipe it away dont do anything to her ill get them for miss winslows sake be successful twentyfour hours he repeated if you dont have them by then shell be disposed of ill retrieve my property myself no ill get them dont hurt her you swore shed never have to be involved she involved herself twentyfour hours chapter contents prev next jessica had no answers alone she sat on the beach chin on her knees and watched the early sun spread streaks of pink above the water yards away ulysses chased the surf bounding back to the shore each time it turned on him hed given up on the idea of conning jessica into tossing sticks for him shed always liked the beach at sunrise it helped her think the screech of gulls the pound of water against rock the burgeoning light always calmed her mind so that an answer could be found not this time it wasnt as if shed never considered marriage sharing a home raising a family but shed never had a clear picture of the man could it be michael she enjoyed being with him talking to him they shared interests but oh there was a but she thought as she lowered her forehead to her knees an enormous but and he loved her shed been blind to it where was her sensitivity she wondered with a surge of guilt and frustration how could a thing a business have been so important that it blocked her vision worse now that she knew what was she to do about it slade came down the beach steps swearing how the hell could he keep a rein on a woman who took off before sunrise gone walking on the beach betsy had told him alone on a deserted beach slade thought grimly completely vulnerable to anything and anyone did she always have to be moving doing why couldnt she have been the lazy halfwit hed imagined her to be then he spotted her head down shoulders slumped if it hadnt been for the mass of wheatcolored hair he would have sworn it was another woman jessica stood straight and was always heading somewhere usually too fast she didnt curl up in a ball of defeat uncomfortable he thrust his hands in his pockets and walked toward her she didnt hear him but sensed the intrusion and the identity of the intruder almost simultaneously slowly she straightened then looked out at the horizon again good morning she said when he stood beside her youre up early so are you you worked late i heard your typewriter sorry no a fleeting smile i liked it is the book going well slade glanced up as a gull soared over their heads whitebreasted and silent it moved for a while last night somethings wrong he thought he started to sit beside her then changed his mind and remained standing what is it jess she didnt answer immediately but turned her head to study his face and what would he do she wondered if he wanted a woman to marry him would he wait patiently choose the best time then be satisfied when she asked him to wait for an answer a ghost of a smile touched her lips god no have you had many lovers she asked what she didnt pay any attention to his incredulous expression but turned to stare out at the surf again i imagine you have she murmured youre a very physical man the clouds skimming over the water were shot through with red and gold as she spoke jessica watched them brighten i can count mine on three fingers she continued in a tone that was more absent than confidential the first was in college a relationship so brief it hardly seems fair to include it he sent me carnations and read shelley out loud she laughed a little as she settled her chin back on her knees later when i was touring europe there was this older man french very sophisticated i fell like a ton of bricks then i found out he was married and had two children shaking her head jessica gripped her knees tighter after that there was an advertising executive oh he had a way with words it was right after my father died and i was groping he borrowed ten thousand dollars from me and vanished i havent been involved with a man since she brooded out to sea i didnt want to get stung again so ive been careful maybe too careful he wasnt overly pleased to hear about the men in her life forcing himself to be objective he listened when she fell silent slade dropped down beside her for the space of a full minute there was nothing but the sound of crashing waves and calling gulls jess why are you telling me this maybe because i dont know you maybe because it seems ive known you for years a bit shakily she laughed and dragged her hands through her hair i dont know taking a deep breath she stared straight ahead michael asked me to marry him it hit him hard like a stunning blow to the back of the neck that leaves you disoriented just for an instant before unconsciousness very deliberately slade gathered a handful of sand then let it sift through his fingers and and i dont know what to do she turned to him then all turbulent eyes and frustration i hate not knowing what to do stop it now he ordered himself tell her youre not interested in hearing about her problems but the words were already slipping out how do you feel about him i depend on michael she began talking fast hes part of my life hes important to me very important but you dont love him slade finished calmly then you should know what to do its not that simple she tossed back with a sound of exasperation she started to rise then made herself sit still hes in love with me i dont want to hurt him and maybe maybe you should marry him so he wont be hurt slade gave a mirthless laugh dont be such an idiot anger rose quickly and was as quickly suppressed it was difficult to argue with logic more miserable than offended she watched a gull swoop low over the water i know marrying him would only hurt both of us in the long run especially if his feelings for me are as deep as he thinks they are youre not sure hes in love with you slade murmured considering the other reasons michael might want her to marry him im sure he thinks he is jessica returned i thought maybe if we became lovers then good god he caught her by the shoulder roughly are you considering offering your body as some sort of consolation prize dont she shut her eyes so she couldnt see the derision in his you make it sound so dirty what the hell are you thinking of he demanded in an uncharacteristic gesture of futility she lifted her hands my track record with men has been so poor i thought well given a little time hed change his mind imbecile slade said shortly just tell him no now you make it sound so easy youre making it complicated jess am i for a moment she lowered her forehead to her knees again his hand was halfway to her hair before he stopped himself youre so sure of yourself slade nothing makes a coward of me more than people i care about the idea of facing him again knowing what i have to do makes me want to run he was responding to the fragility she so rarely showed deep inside him something struggled to be free to comfort her he banked it down an instant before it was too late he wont be the first man whos had a proposal turned down she sighed nothing shed said had made sense once it had been spoken aloud everything he said had some of the burden lifted with a half smile she turned to him have you have i what had a proposal turned down he grinned pleased that the lost look had left her eyes no but then marriage didnt figure in any of them she gave her quick gurgle of laughter what did reaching over he grabbed a handful of her hair is this color real thats an abominably rude question one deserves another he countered if i answer yours will you answer mine no then i suppose well both have to use our imagination jessica laughed again and started to rise but the hand on her hair stopped her the quizzical smile she gave him faded quickly his eyes were fixed on hers dark intense and for once readable desire hot electric restless desire and she was drawn to him already aroused by a look for the first time she was afraid he was going to take something from her she wouldnt easily get back if she managed to get it back at all he pulled her closer and she resisted in an instinctive defense against a nebulous fear jessica put her hands to his chest no this isnt what i want yes yes it is her eyes told him even while her hands pushed him away in one move she was under him on the sand i warned you i wouldnt treat you like a lady his mouth lowered took and enticed fear was buried in an avalanche of passion at the first taste of him response overwhelmed her wild and free jessica forgot what she stood to lose and simply experienced his tongue probed slowly searching expertly seducing while his lips crushed hers in an endless exquisite demand she answered mindlessly willing desperately wanting then he tore his mouth from hers to move over her face as if to absorb the texture of her skin through the sense of taste alone she fretted to have his lips on hers turning her head in search then suddenly fiercely he buried his lips at her throat wrenching a moan from her the sand made whispering sounds as she shifted wanting the agonized delight he was causing to go on and on her hands found their way under his sweater up the planes and muscles of his back down the hard line of ribs to a lean waist the moist air smelled of salt and the sea and faintly of the musky scent of passion his mouth found hers again unerringly as water crashed like thunder on the rocks nearby she felt his lips move against hers though the meaning of his murmur was lost to her only the tone a hint of angry desperation came through then his hands began to search with bruising meticulousness from her hips to her breasts lingering there as if trapped by the softness she was unaware of the sun beating down on her closed lids of the coarse sand under her back there was only his lips and hands now calloused fingers ran over her skin scraping kindling fresh fires while feeding those already ablaze roughly he caught her bottom lip between his teem drawing it into his mouth to suck and nibble until her sighs were moans in a sudden frenzy jessica arched against him center to throbbing center denim strained against denim in a thin frustrating barrier on a groan slade buried his face in her hair immersed in the scent of it as he groped for control but thered be no control he knew with the taste and scent and feel of her overpowering him with a muffled oath he rolled from her springing up before she could touch him and make him forget all reason slade drew air into his lungs harshly letting it cool the heat that radiated through him he had to be out of his mind he thought to have come that close to taking her seconds passed he could tick them off by the sound of her unsteady breathing behind him and his own jess no dont say anything i get the picture her voice was thick and wavering when he turned back she had risen to brush off the clinging sand the glint of the morning sun haloed the crown of her head even while the breeze tossed the ends up and back you changed your mind everyones entitled when she started to walk by him slade gripped her arm jessica jerked against his hold found it firm then threw up her chin hurt slade could see it all too well beneath the anger in her eyes it was better that way he told himself smarter but the words came out of his mouth before he could stop them would you prefer that wed made love on the beach like a couple of teenagers shed forgotten where theyd been place and time hadnt mattered when the need to love had been paramount it only cut deeper into her pride that he had remembered and had maintained enough control to stop id prefer you didnt touch me again she returned coolly she lowered her eyes to his restraining hand then lifted them again slowly starting now slades grip only tightened i warned you once not to push me push you jessica retorted i didnt start this i didnt want this no you didnt start it he took her shoulders now giving her three hard shakes and i didnt want it either so back off her teeth snapped together on the final shake if hurt had outweighed anger before now the tide was turned enraged jessica knocked both of his hands away dont you dare shout at me she yelled outdoing him in volume behind them water hurled itself against rock then lifted in a tumultuous spray and dont intimate that ive thrown myself at you because i havent with her arms pinned she had to toss her head to free it of blowing hair her eyes glinted behind the dancing strands id have you crawling on your hands and knees if i wanted his eyes became gray slits anger mixed with an uncomfortable certainty that she probably could i dont crawl for any woman much less some snotty little twit who uses perfume as a weapon snotty little she broke off sputtering twit she managed after an outraged moment why you simpleminded egotistical ass unable to think of a better defense she shoved a hand against his chest i hope you havent put a woman in that novel of yours because you know zip im not even wearing any perfume and i wouldnt need breathing hard jessica trailed off what the hell are you grinning at your face is pink he told her its cute her eyes flashed golden fury the intent for violence was clear in the step she took toward him lifting his hands aloft palms out slade stepped back truce he wasnt sure when or how but sometime during her diatribe his anger had simply vanished he was almost sorry fighting with her was nearly as stimulating as kissing her nearly jessica hesitated her temper hadnt run its course but there was something very appealing about the way he smiled at her it was friendly and a shade admiring she had the quick notion that it was the first absolutely sincere smile hed given her and it was more important than her anger maybe she said not willing to be too forgiving too quickly state your terms after a moments consideration she placed her hands on her hips take back the snotty little twit the gleam of pure humor in his eyes pleased her for the simpleminded egotistical ass bargaining was her biggest vice jessica curled her fingers and contemplated her nails just the simpleminded the rest stands he hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans youre a tough lady you got it when he held out his hand they shook solemnly one more thing since theyd dealt with the anger slade wanted to deal with the hurt i didnt change my mind she didnt speak after a moment he slipped an arm around her shoulders and began to lead her back toward the beach steps without too much effort he blocked out the nagging voice that told him he was making a mistake slade he glanced down at her as they skirted the small grove at the top of the steps what michaels coming to dinner tonight okay ill stay out of the way no she spoke too quickly then bit her lip no actually i was wondering if you could play chaperone he finished shortly careful jess youre coming close to being a twit again refusing to be angry she stopped in the center of the lawn and turned to him slade everything you said on the beach is true id said the same to myself but i love michael almost the same way i love david when he only frowned at her she sighed what i have to do tonight hurts id just like some moral support it would be a little easier if you were there during dinner afterward ill handle it reluctant and resigned slade let out a long breath just through dinner and youre going to owe me one hours later jessica paced the parlor her heels clicked on the hardwood floor fell silent over the persian carpet then clicked again she was grateful that david had a date it would have been impossible to have hidden her mood from him and just as impossible to have confided in him the business relationship was bound to be strained now between her and michael jessica didnt want to add more problems perhaps michael would even decide to resign she hated the thought of it oh it would always be possible to replace a buyer she thought but theyd been so close such a good team shutting her eyes she cursed herself she couldnt help thinking of michael in conjunction with the shop it had always been that way maybe if they had known each other before the partnership like she and david her feelings would be different jessica clasped her hands together again no there simply wasnt that spark if there had been the shop would never have interfered shed felt the spark once or twice in her life that quick jolt that says maybe just maybe thered been no spark with slade she mused thered been an eruption annoyed jessica shook her head she shouldnt be thinking of slade now or of the two turbulent times shed been in his arms it was only right that she concentrate on michael on how to say no without hurting him before coming into the room slade stopped to watch her always moving he thought but this time there were nerves beneath the energy she was wearing a very simple very sophisticated black dress with her hair caught in a braid over one shoulder looking at her slade had a moments sympathy for michael it wouldnt be easy to love a woman like that and lose unless michael was a total fool one glance at her face was going to give him her answer shed never have to open her mouth hes going to survive jess when she whirled slade strode over to the liquor cabinet there are other women you know he was deliberately offhand deliberately cynical knowing what her reaction would be even with his back to her he thought he could feel the sudden blaze of heat from her eyes i hope you fall hard one day slade jessica retorted and i hope she thumbs her nose at you he poured himself a scotch not a chance he said lightly want a drink ill have some of that she walked over and snatched the glass from his hand then took a long sip dutch courage he asked when she swallowed controlling a grimace she gave him a narrow look while the liquor burned her throat youre being purposely horrid yeah dont you feel better with a helpless laugh she shoved the glass back in his hand youre a hard man slade youre a beautiful woman jessica the quiet words threw her completely off balance shed heard them dozens of times from dozens of people but they hadnt made the blood hum under her skin but then compliments wouldnt roll easily off the tongue of a man like slade she thought and somehow she felt he wasnt only speaking of physical beauty no he was a man whod look beyond what could be seen and into what could only be felt their eyes held a moment too long for comfort it occurred to her that she was closer to losing something vital to him now than she had been on the beach that morning you must be a very good writer she murmured as she stepped away to pour a glass of vermouth why youre very frugal with words and your timing with them is uncanny because her back was to him she allowed herself to moisten her lips nervously the clock on the mantel gave the melodious chime that signaled the hour i dont suppose youd like to write me a speech before michael gets here ill pass thanks slade hesitating only briefly jessica turned to him i shouldnt have told you everything i did out on the beach this morning it really isnt fair to michael for you to know and it isnt fair to you that i dropped my lifes history on you that way youre an easy person to confide in because you listen a bit too well part of my job he muttered and thought of the endless stream of interviews with suspects witnesses victims im trying to thank you jessica said shortly cant you take it graciously dont be grateful until ive done something he tossed back id choke before id thank you again she dumped a splat of vermouth in her glass as the doorbell rang neither man was pleased to be sharing a meal with the other but they made the best of it the general conversation eased slowly toward talk of the shop im glad you went by for a few hours michael jessica poked at the shrimp dijon rather than eating it i dont think davids really up to a full days work yet he seemed well enough and mondays are usually slow in any case he swirled his wine giving his dinner little more attention than jessica you worry too much darling you werent here last week she shredded a roll into tiny pieces saying nothing slade passed her the butter glancing down jessica saw the mess shed made and picked up her wine he was well enough today to sell the connecticut chest to mrs donnigan michael commented after noting the exchange david made a sale to mrs donnigan initial surprise turned to humor youd have to know the lady slade shes a diedinthewool yankee who can stretch a dollar like a piece of elastic michael sells to her on a rare occasion i do but david trailing off she smiled how did he manage it by being very reluctant to part with it when i came in he was nudging her toward the pecan hope chest telling her hed all but promised the other to another customer she gave a quick spurt of laughter well it looks like our boys learning im going to have to give in and let him go to europe with you next time briefly michael frowned down at his plate then very deliberately stabbed a shrimp if thats what you want her distress was immediate before jessica could fumble for a new line of conversation slade intervened by asking what a connecticut chest was she threw him a swift glance of appreciation and let michael take over why did i say that she demanded of herself how could i be insensitive enough to forget that hed asked me to go to europe with him the next time on an inward sigh jessica toyed with her dinner im not going to handle this well she thought im simply not going to handle it well at all how different they are it occurred to her all at once as she watched the two men talk casually michael with his smooth gestures was well groomed in voice and manner sleekly dressed jessica reflected that shed never seen him in anything more casual than a polo shirt and golf pants he was all civilized charm and sophisticated sexuality slade rarely gestured at all it was as if he knew that body language could give his thoughts away no he had a strange capacity for stillness and she wouldnt term him rugged though he favored jeans and sweaters not charming but disarming she decided and his sexuality was anything but sophisticated animal slade asked questions on antiques when he couldnt have cared less this would give jessica a few moments to regain the composure she had so nearly lost it might also give him the opportunity to form a more concrete opinion of michael he seemed harmless enough slade reflected a pretty boy with enough brains to make it his profession or enough brains to be one of the rungs on the smuggling ladder not the top one slade thought instinctively not enough guts he was the type of man slade might have matched jessica with polished intelligent and he was good looking enough if you liked that type apparently jessica didnt they hadnt been lovers slade pondered this as he listened to michael what sort of man he wondered could be around that woman day after day and not make love to her or go mad michael had managed to keep himself in check for nearly three years slade calculated that he hadnt been able to do so for as many days michael adams was either madly in love with her or more clever than he looked catching the way michaels eyes would drift to her occasionally slade felt a stir of sympathy madly in love or not he wasnt indifferent michael took another sip of wine and tried to continue a conversation he was beginning to detest he knew jessica oh yes he thought fatalistically he knew jessica hed seen her answer in her eyes the one woman who mattered to him was never going to be his all three of them were relieved when betsy brought in the coffee tray miss jessica if you dont start eating more than that cooks going to quit again if she didnt quit once a month shed throw the entire household off schedule jessica said lightly food was something she could do without until after she had settled things with michael ill just take a cup to the library slade was up and pouring his own before betsy could object ive got some things to finish up tonight fine jessica took care not to look at him lets have ours in the parlor michael no no betsy ill carry it she continued as the housekeeper started to mutter slade disappeared before she could lift the tray help yourself to the brandy she told michael as they entered the parlor ill just have the coffee he poured a generous amount placing the crystal stopper back in the decanter before turning betsy had lit the fire while they were eating it crackled with a cheer neither jessica nor michael were feeling remaining across the room he watched her pour coffee from the china pot into china cups the set had a delicate pattern of violets on an ivory background michael counted each petal before he spoke jessica her fingers tightened on the handle of the creamer and he swore silently strange that hed never wanted her more than at the moment he was sure hed never have her hed been too confident that when the time was right everything would simply fall into place i didnt mean to make you unhappy her eyes lifted to meet his michael no you dont have to say anything its written all over your face the one thing youve never been able to do well is hide your feelings he took a long swallow of brandy youre not going to marry me say it quick she ordered herself no i cant rising she walked over to stand with him i wish i felt differently michael i wish id known what your feelings were sooner he looked into his brandy the same color as her eyes and just as intoxicating he set the snifter down would it have made any difference if id asked you a year ago two years ago i dont know helplessly she lifted her shoulders but as were basically the same people we were then i dont think so she touched his arm wishing she had better words kinder words i care michael you must know that i do but i cant give you what you want lifting a hand he circled the back of her neck i cant tell you i wont try to change your mind michael no im not going to pressure you now he gave her neck a gentle squeeze but i have the advantage of knowing you well what you like what you dont like taking her hand he pressed a kiss in her palm i also love you enough not to hound you with a smile he released her hand ill see you at the shop tomorrow yes all right jessica pressed her hands together shed felt nothing but regret when hed pressed his lips to her palm good night michael when the front door closed behind him she stood where she was she had no taste for coffee now nor the energy to carry the tray to the kitchen and deal with betsy or the cook leaving things as they were jessica headed for the stairs jess slade stopped her with a word he came down the hall as she paused on the second step okay all of a sudden she wanted badly to cry to turn run into his arms and weep instead she snapped at him no its not okay why the hell should it be you did what you had to do he said calmly hes not going to drive off a cliff what do you know about it she tossed back you havent got any feelings you dont know what its like to care for someone you have to have a heart to be hurt whirling she dashed up the stairs making it almost halfway before she stopped shutting her eyes tight jessica slammed a fist onto the railing after a deep breath she turned and walked back down he stood at the bottom waiting im sorry why because her words had cut deeper than he liked he shrugged you were on target no i wasnt wearily she rubbed a hand over her forehead and i havent any right to use you for a punching bag you gave me a lot of support today and im grateful save it he advised as he turned away this time it was her turn to stop him slade he took two more steps swore then turned back to her his eyes were dark smolderingly angry as if her apology had flamed his temper more than her insults i realize you might think differently but you dont go to hell for being kind with that she left him staring after her as she continued up the stairs chapter contents prev next two am jessica heard the old seth thomas clock in the hall strike two musical bongs her body was exhausted but her mind refused to settle slades spurts of stopandgo typing had silenced over an hour before he could sleep she thought in disgust as she rolled to her back to stare again at the ceiling but then he wasnt in an emotional whirl thoughts of michael drifted to her and she sighed no lets be honest jessica she ordered herself it isnt michael whos keeping you awake its the man two doors down on the left alone in the dark in the tangle of soft linen sheets jessica could feel the scrape of sand against her back the heat of the sun and bite of the wind on her face the press of his body against hers desire churned in her tired body awakening pulses she struggled to calm she felt the ache move slowly from her stomach to her breasts quickly she sprang out of bed and tugged on a robe all she needed was a hot drink to settle her she decided almost frantically if that didnt work shed switch on the television until some old movie lulled her to sleep in the morning shed have herself in order again shed go back to work stay out of slades way until he finished the library and went back to where he came from jessica slipped out of the room and moved on silent bare feet down the hall she paused in front of slades door even reached for the handle before she caught herself good god what was she thinking of moving quickly she headed for the stairs maybe a brandy would be a better idea than the hot drink she decided out of habit she went quietly down the steps avoiding the spots that creaked and groaned brandy and an old movie she told herself if that didnt put her to sleep nothing would seeing that the parlor doors were closed she frowned now who would have done that she wondered they were never closed with a shrug she decided slade had shut them before coming up to write she crossed the hall and pulled one open a light blinded her it shone straight in her eyes forcing her to throw up a hand to shield them shock came first she stepped back stunned by the glare confused by its source before she could speak jessica froze a flashlight no one should be in the closed parlor with a flashlight in the middle of the night fear ran coolly over her skin then lodged like a fist in her throat without a seconds thought she turned and raced back up the stairs slade snapped fully awake the moment his door was flung open a shadow darted toward his bed and instinctively he grabbed it twisted it and pinned it underneath him it gave a quiet whoosh of air as it slammed onto the mattress at the moment of contact he knew he held jessica what the hell are you doing he demanded as his fingers clamped over her wrists her scent flooded his senses instant desire roughened his voice with the wind knocked out of her jessica struggled to speak fear had her body shuddering under his downstairs she managed someones downstairs he tensed but schooled his voice to casualness a servant at two oclock in the morning she hissed as anger began to take over it suddenly seeped into her that he was naked and that her robe had parted when he had yanked her into bed swallowing she struggled beneath him with a flashlight he rolled from her quickly where the parlor snatching her robe together jessica tried to pretend that she hadnt been weakened not for a minute by desire she watched his shadow as he tugged on jeans youre not going down there isnt that what you expected me to do when you came in here he countered he opened a drawer and found his gun no i didnt think at all the police reaching over she switched on the light we have to call the sentence died as she saw what he held in his hand a new bubble of terror rose in her throat where did you get that stay here he was nearly at the door before jessica could propel her numb body from the bed no you cant go down there with a gun slade how he stopped her with a hard bruising grip on her shoulder when they fixed on her his eyes were ice cold and expressionless stay put he ordered then closed the door firmly in her face too shocked to do otherwise jessica stared at the blank wood what in gods name was going on she demanded as she pressed her hands to her cheeks it was crazy someone sneaking around the parlor in the middle of the night slade handling a big ugly gun as if hed been born with it in his hand nerves jumping she began to pace the room it was too quiet she thought as her fingers laced and unlaced just too quiet she couldnt just stand there slade had just finished a quick thorough tour of the first floor when the creak on the steps had him whirling he saw jessica stagger back against the wall eyes wide as he turned the gun on her goddammit the word exploded at her as he lowered the gun i told you to stay upstairs she had enough time to register that shed seen the stance hed taken with the gun on a hundred television police shows then the trembling started i couldnt is he gone looks that way seizing her hand slade dragged her into the parlor stay in here im going to check outside jessica sank into a chair and waited it was dark the thin shifting moonlight tossed wavering shadows around the room defensively she curled her feet under her and cupped her elbows with her hands fear she realized was something shed rarely dealt with she wasnt doing a good job of it now shutting her eyes a moment jessica forced herself to take deep even breaths as the shuddering calmed her thoughts began to focus what was a writer doing with a revolver why hadnt he called the police a suspicion rose out of nowhere and she shook it off no that was ridiculous wasnt it when slade returned to the parlor ten minutes later she hadnt moved from the chair with a flick of the wrist he hit the switch flooding the room with light nothing he said shortly though she hadnt spoken theres no sign of anyone or any sign of a breakin i saw someone she began indignantly i didnt say you didnt then he was gone again leaving her next retort sputtering on her lips he came back without the gun what did you see as he asked he began a more careful search of the room brows drawn together she watched his practiced movements the parlor doors were closed when i opened them a light hit my eyes a flashlight i didnt see anything anything out of place in here she continued to watch his deft professional search as he roamed around the room no the suspicion wasnt ridiculous she realized as her stomach tightened it was all too pat hes done this before hes used that gun before who are you he heard the chill in her voice as he crouched in front of the liquor cabinet none of the crystal had been disturbed he didnt turn you know who i am jess youre not a writer yes i am what is it she asked flatly sergeant lieutenant he took the brandy decanter and poured liquor into a snifter his brain was perfectly cool he walked to her and held out the glass sergeant drink this her eyes stayed level on his go to hell with a shrug slade set the snifter beside her a deadly calm washed over her dulling the sting of betrayal i want you out of my house but before you leave jessica said quietly i want you to tell me why you came uncle charlie did send you didnt he orders from the commissioner the last sentence was full of carefully calculated disgust slade said nothing debating just how much hed have to tell her to satisfy her she was pale but not with fear now she was spitting mad fine keeping her eyes on his she rose then ill call your commissioner myself you can pack your typewriter and your gun sergeant she was going to have to have it all he decided and wished fleetingly for a cigarette sit down jess when she made no move to obey he gave her a helpful shove back into the chair just shut up and listen he suggested as she opened her mouth to yell at him your shops suspected in connection with a major smuggling operation its believed that stolen goods are hidden in some of your imports then transferred to a contact on this side probably through the sale of the whole article she wasnt attempting to speak now but simply staring at him as if hed lost his mind interpol wants the head man rather than the few underlings already under observation hes managed to slip away from them before they dont want it to happen again you your shop the people who work for you are under observation until hes in custody or the investigation leads elsewhere in the meantime the commissioner wants you safe i dont believe a word of it but her voice shook slade thrust his hands in his pockets my information as well as my orders come from the commissioner its ridiculous her voice was stronger now touched with scorn do you think something like that could go on in my shop without my knowing about it even as she reached for the brandy she caught the look in his eyes jessicas hand froze on the glass then dropped away i see she said quietly the pain was dull in her stomach briefly she pressed a hand to it before linking her fingers together did you bring your handcuffs along sergeant cut it out jess because he couldnt handle the way she looked at him slade turned to prowl the room i said the commissioner wanted you protected was it part of your job to attract me enough so that i might be indiscreet when he whirled back she sprang to her feet to meet his fury with her own is making love to me all in a days work i havent begun to make love to you infuriated he grabbed the lapels of her robe nearly hauling her off her feet and i wouldnt have taken the damn assignment if id known you were going to tie me up in knots every time i looked at you the bureau thinks youre clean dont you understand that only puts you in a more dangerous position how can i understand anything when im not told anything she tossed back what kind of danger could i possibly be in this isnt a game jess frustrated he shook her an agent was killed in london last week he was close too close to finding out whos pulling the strings his last report mentioned a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds what does that have to do with me jessica jerked away from him if they think therere diamonds stashed away in one of my imports let them come in they can take the furniture apart piece by piece and tip off the number one man slade returned how do you know im not in charge a raging headache was added to the sickness in her stomach wearily jessica rubbed at her temple i run the shop he watched her slender fingers knead at the ache not alone all movement stopped very slowly jessica lowered her hand david and michael she whispered incredulity gave way to anger no i wont have you accusing them no ones accusing anyone yet no youre here to spy on us i dont like it any better than you then why are you here the deliberate scorn in her tone made him want to strangle her he spoke slowly brutally because the commissioner didnt want his goddaughter to end up with her beautiful throat slit her color drained at that but she kept her eyes level who would hurt me david michael even you must see how absurd that is youd be surprised what people do to survive he said tersely in any case there are other people involved the kind who wouldnt think of you as any more than an expendable obstacle she didnt want to think about that couldnt if she wanted to stop herself from having a bout of hysteria be practical she ordered herself be logical this time she lifted the brandy and drank deeply before speaking if youre with the nypd you have no jurisdiction here the commissioner has a lot of clout the hint of color that seeped back into her cheeks relieved him she was tougher than she looked in any case im not here about the smuggling not officially why are you here officially to keep you out of trouble uncle charlie should have told me slade lifted his shoulders in a half shrug as he looked around the room yeah maybe theres no way of telling if he was after something in here or slipping through this room to another not with the way this house is set up with a frown he ran a hand absently over his bare chest do you see anything out of place in here jessica followed the sweep of his eyes no i dont think he could have been around very long you didnt stop typing until one wouldnt it make sense for him to wait until all the lights were out before he broke in he started to remind her that no one had broken in then changed his mind if it helped her to believe it had been a stranger she might sleep better he thought of david who had a room on the east wing of the first floor ive got to call in my report go on to bed no unwilling to admit that she couldnt bring herself to go upstairs alone jessica lifted the brandy again ill wait she sat as he went out to the phone in the hall purposely she tuned out his conversation though it was carried on in such quiet tones that she would have had to strain to hear her shop she thought how was it possible for her shop to be tangled up in something as fantastic as international smuggling if it hadnt been so frightening she would have laughed michael and david with a brisk shake of her head she shut her eyes no that part she wouldnt believe there was a mistake somewhere and in time the police or the fbi or whoever was haunting her would realize it a burglar had been in the parlor it was as simple as that hadnt betsy grumbled a dozen times about her not using the alarm system the image of slade with the gun in his hand came back to her too clearly that was something she couldnt shut out when he came back into the room jessica was sitting very still eyes closed there were shadows under them what hed just learned on the phone wasnt going to make them go away but perhaps a good nights sleep would come on he said briskly trying not to soften as her eyes shot open in alarm at his voice youre tired go up and take a pill if you cant sleep and youre not going in to the shop tomorrow but i have to she began you have to do as youre told from here on he corrected youll be safer here where i can keep an eye on you starting now you dont leave the house without me dont argue taking her hand he hauled her to her feet you havent got any choice at this point you have to trust me she did jessica realized as he pulled her up the steps that if everything else was a maze of confusion that was clear that very quick first impression shed gotten when shed all but run into him at the bottom of the staircase had been viable with him she was safe i dont like knowing youre a cop she murmured yeah im not always crazy about it myself go to bed jess he dropped her arm as they came to her door before he could move on jessica grabbed his hand slade she hated what she was going to ask hated admitting to herself much less him that she was terrified of being alone i she looked away from the impatience in his eyes and glanced into her darkened room could you stay i told you ive got my orders from the commissioner no i dont mean she moistened her lips i mean with me tonight she looked up at him pale soft vulnerable he felt the blood start to pound in his chest in defense his voice was blunt and cold when i go to bed with a woman i tend to give her my complete attention i havent got time for that now she felt a flutter that was both panic and excitement im not asking you to make love with me just not to leave me alone he allowed his eyes to rake down her warm flesh soft curves and iceblue silk do you think id spend the night with you and not have you no the answer came quick and quiet the flutter became a throb in a quick move calculated to frighten her slade backed her up against the door you havent the experience to deal with me lady not quite gently his hand closed over her throat beneath his palm he felt the wild scramble of her pulse but her eyes her eyes were tawny and unafraid he wanted her with a desperation that threatened to drive everything else aside im not one of your polite country club men jess he told her in a dangerously quiet voice you dont know the places ive been the things ive done i could show you tricks that would make your french lover look like a boy scout if i decided i wanted you you couldnt run fast enough she could barely hear him over the dull thud of her heart her eyes had misted over with desire which of us is running slade her arms were already heavy but she lifted them in one long slow stroke she ran her hands up his naked back he stiffened the fingers on her throat tightened swiftly she pressed her body to his damn you jess on a groan his mouth came down to savage hers her senses whirled from the onslaught but she clung this was what she wanted the mindless passion he could bring her on the instant of contact the kiss wasnt loverlike it wasnt the worshipful merging of lips the gentle teasing of tongues it was madness jessica abdicated her sanity without a second thought let him teach her what he would he ripped the robe from her where they stood then gave into the driving need to let his hands mold every inch of her softer inconceivably softer than he imagined her skin seemed to flow under his fingers within seconds he had her trembling one wracking convulsive shudder after another her thighs were slim and strong running a hand up them he found her then took her gasping to a staggering peak until she swayed helplessly in his arms slade swore again knowing he couldnt stop he had told himself he would treat her callously and then walk away to save her to save himself now she was moist and warm and pliant in his arms her fragrance clung to the air seducing him he shook his head struggling to clear it but she pressed her lips to his throat huskily murmuring his name he was with her in bed not even aware if he had dragged or carried her there jessica twisted under him answering his kiss deliriously as his hands moved everywhere he gave her no chance to orient herself there was a tangle of sheets under her the soft fabric of his jeans against her legs but she was only aware of the hurricane thats where he took her all speeding wind and black sky his ragged breathing shivered into her ear before his tongue darted inside in a zigzagging journey that had her mind spinning he ran openmouthed nibbling kisses down her throat to the hollow between her breasts she arched her nipples hard with need but he continued down and ran his tongue along the line of her ribs half mad she dug her fingers into his hair wanting him to take her before she exploded wanting the agonizing pleasure to go on forever greedily he came back to her breast the moist trail his tongue left causing her to shudder with fire and ice by turns his teeth nipped into the soft swell of flesh while with a fingertip he began a slow torturous path around the other lips and finger circled in until she was writhing beneath him he drew her nipple into his mouth catching the other arching point between his thumb and finger jessica cried out as the dual pleasure exploded then was lost in wave after wave of sensation as his teasing became rampant hunger she was tugging at his jeans but he shifted away from her seeking hands without the restriction he knew hed take her instantly he was far from ready hed sensed her passion knew it lay smoldering but now it was engulfing him in a heat he hadnt foreseen she was wildly responsive like a thoroughbred mare given her head he wanted to drive her drive them both to the breaking point the musky woodsy scent seemed to emanate from her skin wherever he buried his lips her body was slender almost too slender but with a seductive womanly softness that made him want to go on touching and tasting until there was no inch of her he didnt know when his mouth brushed low over her stomach she moaned nails digging into his shoulders as she urged him down he could hear his name trembling out of her lips between raw gasping breaths but when his tongue sought and found the center of her pleasure he lost everything else he drove her to peak after peak exhausted jessica hungered for more her skin was fused to his both hot and damp with desire her body was stunningly alive throbbing from thousands of minute pulses he had discovered and exploited even his name wouldnt form on her lips any longer together they struggled with the last barrier of clothing that kept them apart she found his hips lean and longboned his thighs firm and muscled they came together savagely each gasping from the shock of power she couldnt stop the shudders they continued to race through her long after slade lay beside her silent her body ached and glowed did we make love or war jessica wondered dizzily whatever had happened between them had never happened to her before and she knew with a certainty that it would never happen with any other man none of her inhibitions had surfaced he wouldnt have allowed them to was there another man with his strength his intensity his savagery not for her jessica realized instinctively rolling to him there had never been nor would there ever be anyone else for her shed lost that vital part of herself to him long before they had ever gone to bed her heart oh i love you she thought whoever whatever you are and the surest way to turn you away from me now is to tell you closing her eyes jessica rested her head on his shoulder youre already wondering how you lost control enough to take me to bed she concluded with instinctive accuracy already wondering how to prevent this from happening again but im not going to lose you the vow formed firmly as she ran a hand over his chest youre not getting away slade struggle all you want lightly she ran a trail of kisses over his shoulder to his throat jess slade put up a hand to stop her hed never be able to think clearly with her touching him if he was going to find his way out of the quicksand he was rapidly sinking in he had to think jessica merely kissed the fingers that got in her way then trailed her lips to his cheek hold me she murmured i want your arms around me with an effort slade resisted the husky demand and the soft lips that insisted on clouding his brain jessica this isnt smart weve got i dont want to be smart slade she interrupted she shifted so that her head was just above his her lips just above his dont talk not tonight when her fingers ran down his side she had the satisfaction of feeling his quick involuntary tremor i want you her tongue traced his lips she felt the sudden thunder of his heart against her breast you want me thats all there is tonight in the darkness he could see the pale clouds of hair the moonlit skin shadowed by the slash of cheekbone he saw the amber fire of her eyes before her mouth took his and captured him chapter contents prev next slade woke beside her she was deep in an exhausted sleep her breathing slow and regular there were shadows under the sweep of lashes dark smudges against pale skin his arm was around her slim waist in sleep hed betrayed himself by wanting her close they shared the same pillow he spent several minutes cursing himself before he rolled out of bed jessica didnt even stir he grabbed up his jeans and went to his own room and straight to the shower deliberately slade turned the cold on full hadnt he saturated himself enough with her last night he asked himself furiously as the icy spray hit his body like sharp pinpricks did he have to wake up wanting her need for her this kind of consuming need was going to interfere with his job slade had to remind himself again and again that jessica was a job only a job and in the brief phone conversation the night before he had been told enough to make him realize that her position had become only more delicate someone wanted something in her house someone she trusted knowing who it was wouldnt be enough slade had to find out what it was or rather the feds had to find out what he corrected grimly he had to stick to her like glue until it was all over why the hell dont they let me get her out of here he thought on a fresh burst of fury the order over the phone had been firm and unarguable jessica stayed the investigation couldnt be jeopardized by letting her walk she stayed slade repeated silently and he wasnt to let her out of his sight for the next fortyeight hours that didnt include sleeping with her he reminded himself as he let the cold water sluice over his head it didnt include getting so caught up in her that he forgot what he was doing there in the first place and how the hell was he supposed to live in the same house with her now and not touch her he grabbed the soap and lathered himself roughly maybe it would wash away the woodsy scent that seemed to have crept into his own skin waking jessica reached for him he was gone and so instantly was her peace the few hours of sleep had left her tightly strung instead of relaxed if he had been there if she could have turned to him on wakening she wouldnt have felt the sick sense of loss david and michael no she couldnt even allow herself to think it covering her face with her hands jessica struggled to block it out but then she could see the icy look in slades eyes when he had aimed the gun on her its madness its a mistake a quarter of a million in diamonds interpol david and michael unable to bear it she sprang out of bed she needed to clear her brain to think the house felt like an airless prison she threw on her clothes and headed for the beach when he came by her room to check on her ten minutes later slade found the bed empty the quick panic was as uncharacteristic as it was unprofessional hurriedly he checked the bath and her sitting room before going downstairs he didnt find jessica in the dining room but betsy where is she he demanded betsy cleared off the place she had set for jessica then scowled at him so youre in a chipper mood too wheres jessica betsy sent him a shrewd look looks sick this morning wonder if she caught davids flu down at the beach she continued before he could snap at her alone yes alone didnt even take that overgrown mutt with her said shes not going into work today and betsy placed her hands on her hips and scowled at his retreating back well she muttered and clucked her tongue it was cold concealing his shoulder holster under his jacket was simple by the time slade had reached the beach steps hed nearly run out of curses hadnt anything hed said to her the night before gotten through he spotted her standing near the breakers and tore down the steps and across the sand jessica heard his approach and turned whatever she might have said slipped back down her throat as he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her you idiot what are you doing down here alone dont you know the position youre in her hand swung out connecting sharply with his cheek the slap stunned both of them causing angry eyes to meet angry eyes in quick surprise his grip loosened enough for jessica to step back dont you shout at me she ordered automatically soothing the flesh his hands had bruised i dont have to take that from anyone youll take it from me he said evenly ill give you that one jess but remember i hit back what are you doing out here im taking a walk she snapped i arranged for david to take over the shop today as per your orders sergeant so were back to that he reflected and dug his hands into his pockets his hair whipped unheeded around his face fine my next order is that youre not to leave the house until i say so the fire in her eyes was suddenly misted with tears hugging herself she spun away from him shed show him anger shed show him passion but she refused to show him weakness house arrest she said thickly hed rather have had her slap him again than cry protective custody he countered with a sigh he placed his hands on her shoulders jess swiftly she shook her head knowing that kind words would undermine her completely when she felt his brow drop to the top of her head she squeezed her eyes tight dont fall apart now he murmured it wont be for very long when its over when its over what she interrupted in swift despair will one of the people closest to me be in jail am i supposed to look forward to that on a long breath she opened her eyes and looked out to sea the water was choppy whitecapped and gray a storm was coming in she thought dispassionately the sky was beginning to boil with it youre supposed to get through today he told her tightening his grip then youre supposed to get through tomorrow life she mused is that really how lifes supposed to be is that how he felt about his why did you leave me alone this morning his hands dropped away from her shoulders without turning jessica knew hed stepped back gathering her courage she faced him all the guards were back if her body had not still ached from the fury of lovemaking she might have thought shed imagined all of the night before the man staring at her showed no hint of emotion youre going to tell me it was a mistake she managed after a moment something that shouldnt have happened and wont happen again her chin came up as love warred with pride please dont bother he should have let her go he intended to let her go before he could stop himself slade took her arm carefully wrapping his fingers around it as if measuring its size and strength im going to tell you it was a mistake he said slowly something that shouldnt have happened but i cant tell you it wont happen again i cant be near you and not want you the man shifted his position in the cover of trees with businesslike movements he opened the briefcase and began to fit the pieces of the rifle together for the moment he paid little attention to the two figures down on the beach one thing at a time that was one of the reasons for his success in his field hed only had the contract for four hours and was relatively pleased that it would take him little more than that to complete it after snapping on the sight he pulled out a handkerchief the brisk wind wasnt doing his head cold any good but then ten thousand dollars bought a lot of antihistamines after sneezing softly he replaced his handkerchief then drew a bead on the figures on the beach jessica felt some of her strength returning why was it a mistake then slade let out an impatient breath because im a cop from the lower east side whos seen things i could never tell you about because i want you so much not just now this minute but tomorrow twenty years from now and that scares me oil and water jess its as simple as that you wanted to walk well walk slipping his hand from her arm he interlaced his fingers with hers then turned away from the shore he lowered his rifle as slade blocked his clear shot of jessica the contract was for the woman only and business was business the wind fluttered at his drabcolored overcoat and snuck underneath it sniffling he brought his handkerchief out again then settled down to wait jessica kicked a pebble into a clump of rocks you are a writer arent you so i tell myself then why do you do this you dont like it it shows it wasnt supposed to show the fact that she could see what hed successfully concealed from everyone including himself from time to time infuriated slade look i do what i have to what i know not everybody has a choice no she disagreed everyone has a choice ive got a mother waiting tables and living off a dead cops pension the words exploded from him stopping her ive got a sister in her third year of college whos got a chance to be something you dont pay tuition with rejection slips jessica lifted both hands to his face her palms were cool and soft then you made your choice slade not every man would have made the same one when the time comes and you publish youll have everything jess he took her wrists but held them a moment instead of pulling her hands from his face her pulse speeded instantly at his touch drawing an unwilling response from him you get to me he muttered and you dont like it she leaned toward him lashes lowering he crushed her to him devouring the willing mouth it was as cool as her hands but heated quickly beneath his already frantic he grabbed her hair drawing her head back farther so he could plunder all the sweet moist recesses her arms went around his neck imprisoning him in the softness the fragrance the need the back of his head was caught in the crosshairs of the scope of a highpowered rifle with a sophisticated silencer jess his lips moved against hers with the sound of her name he broke away only to catch her close to his chest holding her there while he tried to steady himself youre tired he said when he heard her sigh well go in you should get some more sleep she allowed him to shift her to his side patience she told herself this isnt a man who gives himself easily im not tired she lied matching her steps to his why dont i give you a hand in the library thats all i need he muttered casting his eyes up in his peripheral vision he caught a quick flutter of white among the thinning leaves in the grove he tensed muscles tightening as he strained to see there was nothing more than a rustling easily caused by the wind then the flutter of white again im terrific at organizing if i put my mind to it jessica claimed as she stepped in front of him and i the breath was knocked out of her as slade shoved her to the ground in back of a small outcropping of rock she heard a quick ping as if stone had struck stone before she could fill her lungs with air hed drawn out his gun what is it whats wrong dont move he didnt even look at her but kept her pinned beneath him as his eyes swept the beach jessicas eyes were locked on his gun slade hes in the grove about ten feet to the right of where we are now he calculated thinking out loud its a good position he wont move at least for a while who she demanded what are you talking about he brought his eyes to hers briefly chilling her with the hard cold look shed seen before the man who just took a shot at you she went as still and stiff as a statue no one did i didnt hear hes got it silenced slade shifted just enough to get a clearer view of the beach steps hes a pro hell wait us out jessica remembered the odd sound shed heard just as slade had shoved her to the ground stone hitting stone bullet hitting rock a wave of dizziness swept over her clouding her vision until she saw nothing but a gray mist from a distance she heard slades voice and struggled against the faintness heart pounding in her ears she focused on him again he was still looking beyond her to the beach steps that we know hes there what impatiently slade looked down at her there wasnt a trace of color in her face against the pallor her eyes were dull and unfocused he couldnt allow her the luxury of going into shock snap out of it and listen to me he said harshly catching her face in his hand odds are he doesnt know weve made him he probably thinks were back here making love if my cover was blown hed have taken care of me instead of waiting to get a clear shot at you now youve only got to do one thing jess understand one thing she repeated with a nod stay put she nearly gave way to a hysterical giggle that sounds like a good idea how long do you think well have to stay here you stay until i get back her arms came around him quickly and with desperate strength youre not going out there hell kill you its you he wants slade said flatly as he pried her arms away from his neck i want you to do exactly as i say he wriggled on top of her and managed to shrug out of his jacket then the shoulder holster after tugging his shirt out of his jeans he tucked the gun in the back waistband im going to stand up and after a minute ill walk over to the steps hell either think you wouldnt play games or that were finished and youre staying out for a while she didnt hold on to him because she knew it was useless he was going to do it his own way what if he shoots you she asked dully a hell of a bodyguard youd make dead if hes going to hell do it the minute i stand up slade told her cupping her face again then youll still have the gun wont you he kissed her hard and quick before she could speak stay put jess ill be back he rose nonchalantly still looking down at her jessica counted ten long silent seconds everything in her system seemed to be on slow motion her brain her heart her lungs if she breathed at all she was unaware of it she lay in a vacuum of fear slade grinned at her a flash of reassurance that didnt reach his eyes numbly she wondered if the smile was for her benefit or for the man in the grove no matter what you stay where you are with this he turned away from her and strolled easily to the beach steps he hooked his thumbs lazily in his pockets as if every muscle in his body wasnt tensed waiting a thin stream of sweat rolled down his back a hell of a bodyguard youd make dead jessicas words played back to him as he forced himself to take the steps slowly he knew how close that one silent bullet had come he was taking a chance coming out in the open not only with himself but with jessica calculated risk slade reminded himself sometimes you played the odds he counted the steps off five six seven it wasnt likely the gunman had the rifle trained on him now hed be waiting for jessica to make a move from behind the clump of rocks ten eleven twelve did she listen this time he thought with a quick flash of panic dont look back for gods sake dont look back there was only one way left to keep her safe the moment he reached the top slade drew out his gun and dashed for the trees the carpet of dried leaves would betray him slade counted it a mixed blessing it would distract the mans mind from jessica he took a zigzagging pattern toward the place where he had spotted the flutter of white just as he dashed behind an oak he heard the dull thud dispassionately he saw splinters of bark fly out inches from his shoulder close he thought very close but his brain was cool now the man would know hed botched the contract just as hed know if slades luck ran out that the police were involved slades gun and his shield would tell the pro all he needed to know patiently slade waited five eternal minutes became ten the sweat was drying cold on his back neither man could move soundlessly so neither moved at all one laying siege to the other a bird frightened off by slades mad rush into the grove came back to settle on a limb and sing joyfully a squirrel hunted acorns not ten feet away from where he stood slade didnt think at all but waited the stormbrewing clouds closed in completely blocking out the sun now the grove was cold and gloomy wind whipped through his loose shirt there was a muffled sneeze and a rustle of leaves instantly slade sprang out toward the sound hitting the ground and rolling when he caught a quick glimpse of the man and the rifle prone he fired three times jessica lay numbed by a fear icier than the wind off the sound that was all she could hear the wind and the water once she had loved the sound of it the howling wind the passionate crash of water against rock staring up at the sky she watched the clouds boil with one hand she clutched slades discarded jacket the leather was smooth and cold but she could just smell him she concentrated on that if she could smell him he was alive if she willed it hard enough for long enough hed stay alive too long her mind shouted its been too long her fingers tightened on the leather hed said hed be back she was going to believe that with her fingertips she touched her lips and found them cold the warmth hed left there had long since faded i should have told him i love him she thought desperately i should have told him before he left what if no she wouldnt let herself think it he was coming back painfully she shifted enough so that she could watch the beach steps she heard the three rapid shots and froze the pain in her chest snapped her out of it her lungs were screaming for air dimly jessica ordered herself to breathe before she scrambled up and ran fear made her clumsy twice she stumbled on her way up the steps only to haul herself up and force more speed into her legs she broke into the grove skidding on cracked leaves and branches slade sprang around the moment he heard her he was quick but not quick enough to prevent her from seeing what hed been determined she wouldnt see jessica stopped her headlong rush into his arms relief turning to shock and shock to trembling cursing he stepped in front of her blocking her view dont you ever listen he demanded then pulled her into his arms is he did you unable to finish she shut her eyes she wouldnt be sick she ordered herself she wouldnt faint one of his shirt buttons ground into her cheek and she concentrated on the pain youre not hurt no he said shortly this aspect of his life should never have touched her he berated himself he should have seen to it why didnt you stay on the beach i heard the shots i thought hed killed you then youd have done us both a lot of good rushing in here he pulled her away took one look at her face and yanked her back into his arms its all right now for the first time his tone was gentle loving it broke her down as his shouting and anger would never have done she began to weep in raw harsh sobs the fingers of one hand digging into his shirt the fingers of the other still holding his jacket without a word he led her to the edge of the grove he sat on the grass then drew her down into his lap and let her cry it out not knowing what else to do he rocked stroked and murmured im sorry she managed still weeping i cant stop get it all out jess his lips brushed her hot temple you dont have to be strong this time burying her face against his chest she let the tears come until she was empty even when she quieted he stroked the hair from her damp face rocking her with a gentle rhythm the need to protect had long since stopped being professional if he could have found the way slade would have blocked the morning from her mind taken her away somewhere someplace where no ugliness could touch her i couldnt stay on the beach when i heard the shots no he kissed her hair i suppose not i thought you were dead ssh he took her lips this time with a tenderness neither of them had known he possessed you should have more faith in the good guys she wanted to smile for him but threw her arms around his neck instead the contact was another reassurance that he was whole and safe oh slade im not sure i could live through something like that again why why would anyone want to kill me it just doesnt make sense he drew her away so that their eyes met hers were red and swollen from weeping his cool and direct maybe you know something and dont even realize it the pressures on and whoevers in charge of this business is smart enough to know it youve become a liability but i dont know anything she insisted pressing the heels of her hands to her temples someone wants to kill me and i dont even know who it is or why you said that that man was a professional someone paid him to kill me lets go inside he pulled her to her feet but she jerked away the helpless weeping was over and the strength was back though it had the dangerous edge of hysteria how much was i worth she demanded thats enough jess he took her by the shoulders for one quick shake enough youre going to go in and pack a bag ill take you to new york im not going anywhere the hell you arent he muttered as he started to pull her toward the house jessica yanked out of his grip for the second time you listen to me its my life my shop my friends im staying right here until its over ill do what you tell me to a point slade but i wont run he measured her slowly ive got to call this business in youre to go straight to your room and wait for me she nodded not trusting his easy acceptance all right he nodded not trusting hers the moment she stepped into her room jessica began to peel off her clothes it was suddenly of paramount importance that she scrub off every grain of sand every lingering trace of the time she had spent on the beach she turned the hot water in the tub on full until the room was misted with steam plunging in she gasped at the shock of the heat against her chilled skin but took the soap and lathered again and again until she could no longer smell the scent of salt water the scent of her own fear it had been a nightmare she told herself this was normalcy the cool green tile on the walls the leafy fern at the window the ivory towels with the pale green border she had chosen herself only the month before a month ago she thought when her life had been simple thered been no man then coolly attempting to kill her for a fee david had still been the brother shed never had michael had been her friend her partner she hadnt even heard of a man named james sladerman she closed her eyes and pressed hot damp fingers to them no it wasnt a nightmare it was real she had lain curled behind a pile of rocks while a man she barely knew and loved had risked his life to protect hers it was horribly horribly real and she had to face it the time was over when she could try to pass off what slade had told her as a mistake while she had been blindly trusting someone she loved had deceived her involved her used her which one she asked herself which one could she believe it of would either david or michael have stood passively by while someone arranged to have her killed lowering her hands jessica forced herself to be calm no whatever else she would believe she wouldnt believe that slade thought she might know something without being aware of it if that was true she was no closer to the solution than she had been before jessica slid her body down in the tub and closed her eyes again there was nothing for her to do but wait anything but satisfied with his conversation with his contact slade put a call through directly to the commissioner sergeant what have you got for me someone tried to kill jessica this morning he answered curtly for a moment there was dead silence on the wire give me the details dodson demanded briefly emotionlessly slade reported while his knuckles turned white on the receiver she wont leave voluntarily he finished i want her out today now i need you to officially give me the right to put her in protective custody i can have her in new york in less than two hours i take it youve already checked in with this your friends in the bureau want her to stay this time he didnt attempt to disguise the bitterness in his voice they dont want anything to interfere with the investigation at this delicate state he quoted jamming a cigarette between his lips as long as shes willing to cooperate they wont move her and jessicas willing to cooperate shes a stubborn thickheaded fool whos too busy thinking about adams and ryce and that precious shop of hers youve gotten to know her i see the commissioner commented does she trust you slade expelled a stream of smoke she trusts me keep her in the house slade in her room if you think its necessary the servants can think shes ill i want what you want isnt the issue dodson cut him off curtly or what i want he added more calmly if its gone far enough that a pro was hired shell be safer there with you than anyplace else weve got to nail this down fast with luck before its known that the contract on her is no longer operable shes nothing more than bait slade said bitterly just make sure she isnt swallowed dodson retorted youve got your orders yeah ive got them disgusted slade slammed down the receiver looking down at his hands he realized frustrated that they were as good as tied he was up against a solid wall of refusal from jessica right on down the investigation the justice of it didnt matter to him any longer she was all that mattered that in itself destroyed his objectivity and by doing so made her vulnerable he cared too much to think logically his hands curled into fists no cared wasnt the right word he admitted slowly he was in love with her when or how he didnt have the faintest idea maybe it had started that first day she had come tearing down the steps toward him and it was stupid he scraped his hands roughly over his face even without the mess they were in it was stupid theyd been born on opposite sides of the fence had lived their entire lives on opposite sides of the fence he didnt have any right to love her even less to want her to love him she needed him now professionally as well as emotionally that would change when it was over right now he couldnt afford to think of how he would deal with his feelings once jessica was safe again first he had to make certain she would be with slow deliberate force he crushed out his cigarette then went upstairs to her they came into the bedroom together jessica from the bath slade from the hall she was wrapped in one of the ivory towels with the pale green border her hair fell wet around her shoulders while the clean sharp scent of soap surrounded her her skin was flushed and glowing from the heat of her bath for a moment they stood still watching each other she could feel the frustration the anger in him as he turned to close the door behind him are you all right yes she sighed a little because it was nearly the truth im better dont be angry with me slade dont ask for the impossible all right needing something to do she went to the dresser and picked up her brush what do we do now we wait straining against impotence he jammed his fists in his pockets youre to stay in the house let the servants think youre ill or tired or just plain lazy youre not to answer the door or the phone or see anyone unless im with you she slammed the brush back down her eyes meeting his in the mirror i wont be jailed in my own home either that or a cell he improvised adding a shrug either way you want it you cant put me in a cell dont bet on it leaning back against the door he ordered his muscles to relax youre going to play this my way jess starting now her automatic rebellion was instantly quelled as she remembered those agonizing minutes on the beach she wasnt only risking her own life she realized but his as well youre right she murmured im sorry abruptly she whirled around i hate this i hate all of it i told betsy you didnt want to be disturbed he answered calmly shes got it into her head that youve caught a touch of davids flu well let her go on thinking it why dont you get some sleep dont go she said quickly as he reached for the doorknob ill just be down in the library you need to rest jess youre worn out i need you she corrected and walked to him make love to me slade as if we were just a man and a woman who wanted to be together lifting her arms she circled his neck cant we believe that its true for just a few hours lets give each other the rest of the morning he lifted the back of his hand to her cheek in a gesture they both found uncharacteristic slade wondered if she knew that his need was as great as hers to touch to lose himself in lovemaking so close he thought as he ran his knuckles over the line of her cheekbone hed come so close to losing her your eyes are shadowed his voice was rough with emotion you should rest but his lips were already lowering to seek hers the brush of mouth on mouth gentle caring comforting jessica melted against him overpowered by the tenderness shed drawn out of him his hand was still on her face gliding over her features as if to memorize them on a sigh her lips parted softening under his until he thought he would sink into them they had stood there only the night before locked in an embrace that had been turbulent with passion almost brutal with desire the soothing quality of his kiss was no less arousing the pulse at the base of her throat beat thickly as slades fingertip slid down to it she needed he needed thinking only of this he brought his hand to the loose knot of the towel to draw the material from her before he carried her to bed jessica saw his eyes dark and intense sweep over her as she began to unbutton his shirt then her fingers were trapped between their bodies his mouth fixed on hers again the night before hed made her soar now he made her float soft kisses soft words both unexpected rained over her his fingers combed through her damp hair spreading it out on the pillow lingering in its silk as if he would touch each individual strand her hands were free again and trembling they dealt with the last buttons on his shirt she felt a quiver race after her exploring hands heard his incoherent murmur as she worked the rest of his clothes from him flesh to heated flesh they began the journey rain began to patter against the windows hed never been a gentle lover intense yes passionate yes but never gentle she unlocked something in him something giving and tender no less desperately than the night before he wanted her but with the hunger came the sweet calming breath of love the peaceful emotion guided them both to meet the unspoken needs of the other touch me here let me taste look at me there was no need for words when hearts and minds were attuned he wandered over the body he already knew so well in the gray gloomy light he worshiped her with hands lips and eyes naked heavy eyed skin flushed with desire jessica lay quietly as he took his gaze over her with the slow intensity she recognized she was a willing prisoner in the thick humming world conceived by pleasure and sensation the rain grew loud the room dimmer lifting a hand to either side of his face she drew him back to her with her tongue she slowly traced the shape of his mouth then probed inside to drink up all the tastes of him flavors musky and sharp seeped into her deep into her until she hungered for more desire rose to the next plane not so gentle now nor so calmly they sought each other kisses became possessive caresses urgent under the sound of the rain she heard his breath shudder under the pressure of her hands she felt his muscles tighten the liquefying pleasure that had ruled her became a hot torrid need catapulting her beyond the gray insular room into a place of white light and golden fire searing searching seducing his mouth veered down her over her until her skin was molten with a strength only recently discovered she rolled on top of him to complete a crazed journey of her own they tangled and untangled in a wildly choreographed dance of passion the light wasnt white now but red the fire flamed blue she heard her name rip from his lips before they crushed down on hers whatever madness he spoke was muffled against her in his urgency desire spun into delirium as they came together there was speed and strength and desperation faster and faster they climbed while his mouth clung to hers swallowing her gasps mixing them with his own spent she lay beneath him his mouth was pressed to her throat his hands tangled in her hair the rain drummed against the windows now hurled by the wind his body was warm and damp and heavy on hers a feeling of security drifted over her followed by a weariness that reached her bones slade lifted his head to see her eyes glazed over with fatigue youll sleep now it wasnt a question he tempered the command with a kiss youll stay the words were thick as she fought off sleep long enough to hear his answer ill start the fire rising slade walked to the white brick hearth and added paper to the kindling the long match hissed as he struck it crouched he watched the flames lick then catch minutes passed but he remained staring steadily at the fire without seeing it he knew what was happening to him no what had happened to him slade corrected he was in love with a woman he should never have touched a woman he had no business loving a woman he reminded himself grimly whose life depended on him until she was out of danger he couldnt afford to think of his own feelings or of their consequences for her sake the cop had to come first the man second straightening he turned back to her the shock of the morning had taken its toll in exhaustion he noted she lay on her stomach one hand balled loosely on the pillow her hair fanned out dry now her face pale beneath its disorder her eyes were shadowed her breathing heavy the fire brought flickers of light into the room to play over her skin she was too small he thought too slender to deal with what had happened to deal with the threat of what could happen and how much good would he do her he asked himself as his eyes passed over her love clouded his judgment slowed his reflexes if hed been an instant slower that morning shaking his head slade began to dress it wouldnt happen again hed keep her in the house if he had to chain her hed see her through this keep her safe and then then hed get out of her life he promised himself and get her out of his he drew the sheet over her allowing his hand to linger on her hair briefly before he left the room chapter contents prev next late late in the morning while jessica slept slade stood at the library window that faced the garden watery sunlight struggled through the clouds to fall on the wet shrubs and grass rosebushes were naked and thorny fall flowers hung heavyheaded and dripping their petals scattered the storm had stripped the leaves away from the trees so that they lay soggy and dull on the ground the wind had died someone had let ulysses out the dog lumbered along on the wet ground sniffing here and there without any apparent interest finding a likely branch he clamped it between his teeth then trotted off toward the beach hell of a watchdog slade thought in disgust but then who could blame the dog for not barking at someone he knew someone hed seen in the house for years scrubbing his face with his hands slade turned away from the window the waiting was eating at him another sign that he was losing his objectivity by rights he should have taken this part of the assignment in his stride as long as jessica did what she was told there was virtually no way for anyone on the outside to get to her the man who had been in the parlor the night before was running scared and for that reason wouldnt test his luck during the day in a house full of active servants if everything went according to plan it was simply a matter of holding tight until the fbi made its move if slade thought tightly everything went according to plan plans had a way of veering off course when the human element was involved a glance at his watch told him that jessica had been asleep for half an hour with luck shed sleep through the day when she slept she was safe and every hour that she was safe brought them closer to the finish idly he picked up one of the books from a pile hed begun to organize shed have to get someone to take care of this mess he thought once her life was settled again once her life was settled he repeated silently and he was back in new york away from her with an oath he tossed the book aside was he ever going to get away from her he wondered with something uncomfortably close to fear oh he could put the distance between them miles of distance all he had to do was to get into his car and head it in the right direction but how long would it take him to chase her out of his head that was for tomorrow he reminded himself and was suddenly abominably tired he knew better than to think of tomorrows slade turning he saw jessica in the doorway it annoyed him that she was there infuriated him that her face was still pale her eyes still shadowed what are you doing up he demanded you look like hell jessica managed a weak smile thanks you know how to boost a womans morale sergeant youre supposed to be resting he reminded her i couldnt sleep take a pill i never take pills because her hands were clammy she linked them together she wouldnt tell him of the nightmare that had woken her of the sharp sweating fear that had had her choking back a scream as she fought off sleep nor would jessica tell him how she had reached for him only to find him gone are you working slade frowned then followed her gaze to the pile of books beside him i might as well clear up some of this he said with a shrug ive got nothing but time now i could help uncomfortably aware that her movements were jerky jessica walked farther into the room and dont make one of those snide remarks she continued hurriedly i know the librarys a disgrace and the finger points at me but i do have a knack for organizing once i get started if nothing else i can fetch and carry for you until he cut off her stream of hasty words by putting his hand over hers as she reached for a book her skin was ice cold instinctively he tightened his grip wanting to warm her jess go back to bed get some sleep ill have betsy bring you up a tray later im not sick the words erupted from her as she yanked her hand away youre going to be slade returned evenly if you dont take care of yourself stop treating me like a child she ordered enunciating each word carefully i dont need a baby sitter no he gave a quick laugh remembering his early conception of his assignment then tell me how much sleep have you had in the last two days whens the last time youve had a meal i had dinner last night she began you pushed your dinner around your plate last night he corrected keep it up youll pass out and make my job easier im not going to pass out she said quietly her eyes had darkened that much more of a contrast to her skin because he wanted to rage at her slade withdrew i wouldnt count on it but suit yourself he said carelessly overall it doesnt matter whether youre conscious or unconscious in dismissal he turned back to the stack of books im sorry im not as accustomed to this sort of thing as you are jessica began in a tone that started off calm then became more and more agitated it isnt every day im investigated by the fbi and shot at by a professional gunman the next time im sure ill be able to enjoy a banquet after i see a dead body on my property all in a days work for you isnt it slade killing a man a hard knot lodged in his stomach another in his chest casually he pulled out a cigarette and lit it chest heaving with the emotion of her words she watched him dont you feel anything jessica demanded he made himself take a long slow drag made himself speak calmly what do you want me to feel if id been slower id be dead swiftly she turned away then pressed her forehead to the window glass the few clinging raindrops blurred and seemed to multiply until she shut her eyes and so would you she reminded herself what he did he did for you im sorry she murmured im sorry why his voice was as cool as the pane she rested upon and just as hard you were on target again taking a deep breath jessica turned to face him yes the guards were there but she knew him better now what he had done that morning hadnt been done coldly you hate being reminded that youre just as human as the rest of us dont you it infuriates you that youre haunted by feelings emotions needs slowly she walked to him i wonder if thats why you wont stay with me after weve made love are you afraid ill find a weakness slade a little crack i might be able to widen watch how far you go he warned softly you wont like the trip back you hate wanting me dont you in a deliberately controlled movement slade crushed out his cigarette yes as she opened her mouth to speak again the door to the library swung open both she and slade turned to see david stride in he took a long look at jessica then pushed his glasses back up on his nose you look like hell why arent you in bed david she couldnt control the tremor in her voice or the sudden urge that had her racing into his arms to hug him fiercely david sent slade a surprised look over her shoulder as he awkwardly patted her back whats all this you got a fever come on jessie not him she thought desperately please god not david through sheer force of will jessica controlled the tears that burned in her eyes in silence slade watched the exchange jessica clung to davids thin frame as if it were an anchor while he looked puzzled concerned and embarrassed all at once speculating slade dipped his hands into his pockets hey whats all this is she delirious david tossed the question at slade but managed to nudge jessica back enough to peer into her face you look ready to drop he stated and tested her forehead with his palm mom called me at the shop giving me all kinds of grief about passing on my germs drawing her away he grimaced at the memory thats what you get for coming into my room and shoving that chicken soup down my throat im all right she managed just a little tired sure tell that to someone who didnt spend last week flat on his back moaning jessica wanted to cling to him again to pour out everything that was inside her instead she took a step back smiled and hated herself ill be fine im just going to take it easy for a couple of days have you called the doctor david the annoyance in her tone pleased him its great having the situation reversed he told slade she did nothing but nag for two weeks have you he demanded of jessica again when i need one ill call one why arent you at the shop dont worry im heading right back david shot her a grin relieved by the question and the brisk tone that was more like jessica after mom called and read me the riot act i wanted to check on you the deliveries went out yesterday without any problem traffics been light but ive made enough sales to earn my keep he gave her hair a quick tug i dont want to see you in the shop until next week babe michael and i can handle it in fact you look like you could use a vacation if you tell me how terrible i look again youre not going to get that raise youve been hinting about thats what happens when you work for a woman he told slade turning david headed back for the door mom says for you two to come in to lunch this time youre getting the chicken soup with a satisfied grin tossed over his shoulder he left them the moment the door closed jessica pressed both hands to her mouth what ran through her wasnt pain not even an ache but a bloodless kind of hurt that left her numb in the vital areas of heart and mind she didnt move or make any sound for a moment she felt that she had simply ceased to exist not david her own whispered words jolted her with them came a torrent of emotion not david she repeated whirling on slade i wont believe it nothing you can say will make me believe hed do anything to hurt me he isnt capable any more than michael is in a couple of days itll be over slade kept his tone neutral then youll know one way or the other i know now spinning around she dashed for the door slades hand clamped down on hers on the handle youre not going after him he said evenly when she tried to jerk free he took her by the shoulders with more gentleness than he was feeling he hated to see her like this tormented desperate hating knowing it was him she would turn against but he had no choice youre not going after him he said again spacing the words precisely unless i have your word ill cuff you to the bed and lock you in he narrowed his eyes as her hand struggled beneath his i mean it jess she didnt turn against him but to him and that slade discovered was worse not david she murmured crumpling into his arms slade i cant bear it i think i could stand anything but knowing either one of them was involved with what with what happened this morning she seemed so fragile he was almost afraid she would shatter if he applied the least pressure what do i do with her now he wondered as he laid his cheek on her hair he knew how to handle her when she was furious he could even manage her when she dissolved into stormy tears but what did he do when she was simply limp and totally dependent on him she was asking him for reassurance he couldnt give emotion he was terrified to offer jess dont do this to yourself block it out a couple of days he tilted up her chin until their eyes met he saw trust and a plea let me take care of you he heard himself say i want to take care of you he wasnt aware of moving until his lips found hers her vulnerability undermined him to keep her from harm to shield her from hurt seemed his only purpose think of me he murmured unconsciously speaking the thoughts that raced around in his head only think of me slade drew her closer changing the angle for more soft nibbling kisses tell me you want me let me hear you say it yes i want you breathless and pliant she allowed him to give and to take while she remained passive for the moment jessica had no strength to offer anything but surrender in return but it was enough for both of them in his arms she could almost forget the nightmare and the reality he took her hands and buried his lips in the palm of one then the other it surprised her enough to steady rather than arouse her slade wasnt a man for endearments or for typically romantic gestures even as the tingle ran up her arms it occurred to jessica that her weakness her despair only made his difficult job impossible hed been wiser than he knew to ask her to think of him drawing on her reserves of strength she straightened her shoulders and smiled at him betsy has a nasty temper when she has to keep meals waiting gratified he answered the smile hungry yes she lied jessica managed to eat a little though the food threatened to stick in her throat knowing slade watched her she made an effort to appear as though she were enjoying the meal she talked rambled about anything but what was foremost on her mind too many topics of conversation could lead back to the shop to david to michael to the man in the grove jessica found herself fighting the inclination to look out the window to look out only reminded her that she was imprisoned in her own home tell me about your family she demanded almost desperately deciding that it would be better to go along with her pretense than insist she eat or rest slade passed her cream for the coffee she was allowing to grow cold my mothers a quiet woman the kind of person who talks only when she has something to say she likes little things like the figure i bought in your shop and fussy glass she plays the piano started taking lessons again last year the only thing she ever insisted on was that janice and i learn to play do you slade heard the surprise in her voice and gave her a mild scowl badly he admitted she finally gave up on me how does she feel about jessica hesitated then picked up her spoon to stir her coffee about what you do she doesnt say slade watched her move the spoon around and around until a tiny whirlpool formed in the cup i wouldnt think it any easier to be the mother of a cop than the wife of one but she manages shes always managed with a nod jessica pushed the untouched coffee aside and your sister janice you said she was in college she wants to be a chemist he gave a quick mystified laugh she said so after her first day in high school chemistry you should see her mixing all those potions this tall skinny girl with soft eyes and beautiful hands not your average mad scientist she blew up our bathroom when she was sixteen jessica laughed perhaps her first genuine laugh in twentyfour hours did she really a minor explosion slade passed it off pleased to hear the low gurgle that had been so much a part of her until the day before the super wasnt too impressed with her explanation of unstable compounds one can see his point jessica mused where does she go to school princeton she got a partial scholarship and even with that jessica reflected the cost of tuition must devour his income how much did a cop make she wondered not enough she thought instantly not nearly enough to compensate for the risk his writing takes a back seat to his sisters education jessica studied the cold coffee in her cup and wondered if janice sladerman realized how much her brother was willing to sacrifice for her you must love her very much she murmured and your mother slade lifted a brow it wasnt something he thought of it simply was yes i do things havent been easy on either of them they never complain never expect and you lifting her eyes jessica gave him a long quiet look how have you managed to hide from them what you really want sensing his instant withdrawal she reached out to take his hand you really hate anyone knowing what a nice person you are dont you slade doesnt suit the tough cop image she grinned pleased to see that shed embarrassed him you can always tell me how you knock suspects around until they beg to confess youve been watching too many old movies linking his fingers with hers slade drew her to her feet theyre one of my vices she confessed i cant tell you how many times ive seen the big sleep thats about a private detective not a cop he pointed out as he walked her back to the library whats the difference he shot her a look how much time do you have well she considered glad to forget the outside world for a few moments it might be interesting to learn why ones called a flatfoot and the other a gumshoe he stopped turning to her with an expression between amusement and exasperation very old movies he decided classics she corrected i only watch them for their cultural value slade only lifted a brow at that it was a gesture jessica had learned he used in lieu of dozens of words since you want to help you can do the cataloging he gestured toward the pile of books littering the work table your handwriting has to be better than mine all right grateful for any task jessica plucked one of a neat stack of index files i suppose youll want to reference and crossreference and all that sort of thing something like that slade she put the card back down before she turned to him youd rather be working on your book than doing this why dont you take a couple of hours for yourself he thought of the novel nearly finished waiting for him on the desk upstairs then he thought of the way jessica had looked when she had walked through the library doors an hour before this kind of mess drives me crazy he told her while im here i might as well point you in the right direction how many books are in here he asked before she could voice another objection momentarily distracted jessica looked around i dont have any idea most of these were my fathers he loved to read a smile touched her lips then her eyes his taste was eclectic to say the least but i think he had a preference for hardboiled whodunits the thought occurred to her quite suddenly whats your book about is it a detective novel the one im working on now he grinned no well she lowered a hip to the table what then he began to make a clear space for her to work its about a family beginning in the postwar forties and working through modern day changes adjustments disappointments victories let me read it she demanded impulsively his words she knew instinctively would reveal much of the inner man its not finished ill read what is searching for a pencil slade stalled he wanted his words read it was a dream hed lived with for too many years to count but jessica was different she wasnt the nameless faceless public her opinion good or bad held too much weight maybe he muttered if youre going to help youd better sit down slade wrapping her arms around his waist jessica rested her cheek on his back ill just bother you until you say yes its a talent of mine something about the casually intimate embrace stirred him beyond belief her breasts pressed lightly against his back her hands linked loosely at his waist in that moment for that moment he surrendered completely to the love he felt for her it was deeper than need sharper than longing didnt she see that there was nothing he could refuse her slade thought as he brought his hands down to cover hers couldnt she see that shed become woman and dream and vulnerability all in the space of days if they were to pretend for her sake that there was no threat beyond the walls perhaps they could pretend for his that she belonged to him bother me he invited turning so that he could gather her into his arms but i warn you im no pushover with a low laugh jessica rose on her toes until her lips brushed his i can only hope my works cut out for me deepening the kiss she slid her hands under his shirt to run them up the firm planes of his back along the ridge of muscle that might get you a couple of pages he murmured want to try for a chapter she allowed her tongue to trace his lips lazily giving them a quick teasing nip as she slid a finger up and down his spine she sensed his response just as she sensed his reluctance to show it to her bargaining is my forte she told him quietly she gave him a slow lingering kiss retreating just as she felt him increase the pressure just how many chapters are in this book slade closed his eyes the better to enjoy the sensation of being seduced when no seduction was necessary about twentyfive hmmm he felt her lips curve as they touched his again this could take all day count on it unexpectedly he drew her away then framed her face with his hands we can start negotiations right after we do some work in here oh catching her tongue between her teeth jessica looked around at the disordered books after after slade said firmly nudging her down in a chair start writing jessica was hardly aware of the hours that passed one then two then three he worked quietly systematically and with a patience she could never hope to emulate slade knew the books a great deal better than she jessica saved reading for the rare times when her physical energy lagged behind her mental energy she enjoyed books he loved them she found this small realization another step in the ladder to discovering him it was easier in the quiet cluttered library to get him to talk have you read this yes what did you think of it and he would tell her easily and in depth without ever stopping his work how her father would have liked him jessica thought he would have admired slades mind his strength his sudden flashes of humor he would have seen the goodness slade took such care to keep hidden she doubted slade realized that by letting her work with him here he was revealing his other side the dreamer perhaps shed always known it was there even when she had recognized the streak of hard street sense it was a complex man who could carry a gun and discuss byrons don juan with equal ease that afternoon she needed the dreamer perhaps he knew it the light began to fade to a soft gray shadows gathered in the corners of the room jessica had forgotten her tension and had become involved with the mindless task of copying titles and names onto the index cards when the phone rang she scattered two dozen of them on the floor quickly she began to retrieve them it just startled me she said when slade remained silent she cursed her trembling hands as she gathered the cards back into a pile its been so quiet thats all furious with herself she let the cards fall again damn it dont sit there looking at me like that id rather you swore at me he rose and went to her then crouched in front of her you made a hell of a mess he murmured if you cant do better ill have to get myself a new assistant with a sound that was part sigh part laugh she leaned her forehead against his give me a break its my first day on the job betsy opened the door then lifted her brows and pursed her lips well she always figured where there was smoke there was fire and shed smelled smoke the minute those two had set eyes on each other she gave a quick harrumph and watched jessica jump as though shed been scalded mr adams is on the phone betsy said regally then closed the door again slade closed his hand over jessicas call her back he said quietly have her tell him youre resting no with a quick shake of the head she rose dont keep asking me to run slade because i might do it then id hate myself turning she picked up the phone hello michael slowly slade straightened tucked his hands in his pockets and watched her no its nothing really just a little touch of the flu jessica spoke in quiet tones while she wrapped the phone cord around and around her fingers davids just feeling guilty because he thinks i caught it from him he shouldnt have worried you i am taking care of myself she shut her eyes tightly a moment but her voice remained light and steady no i wont be in tomorrow the cord of the phone dug into her skin carefully jessica unwound it thats not necessary michael no really i promise dont worry ill be ill be fine in a couple of days yes i will goodbye after replacing the receiver jessica stood for a moment staring down at her empty hands he was concerned she murmured im never ill he wanted to come over and see me but i put him off good sympathy wouldnt help her now slade decided weve done enough in here for today why dont we go upstairs he walked to the door as if taking her agreement for granted he opened it then paused and looked back she still hadnt moved come on jess she crossed to him but stopped at the door michael would do nothing to hurt me she said without looking at him i just want you to understand that as long as you understand that i have to look at everyone as a potential threat he returned evenly youre not to see either one of them or anyone else unless im with you spotting the light of defiance in her eyes he continued if he and david are innocent the next couple of days wont do them any harm if you really believe it he went on shrugging off the look of fury she sent him you should be able to handle all this he wasnt going to give her an inch jessica concluded as she fought both tears and rage perhaps it was best if he didnt she took a long steadying breath youre right and i will handle it are you going to work on your book now slade gave no sign that the change of subject made any difference to him i thought i might jessica was determined to be just as practical as he at least on the surface fine go on up then and ill bring some coffee for both of us you can trust me she went on before he could object ill do exactly what you tell me to do so i can prove you wrong i am going to prove you wrong slade she told him with quiet concrete determination fine as long as you stick to the rules finding herself more at ease with a goal in mind jessica smiled then ill bring up the coffee while im reading your book you can concentrate on finishing it its one sure way to keep me occupied for the rest of the day he pinched the lobe of her ear is that a bribe if you dont know one when you hear one she countered you must be a pretty lousy cop chapter contents prev next jessicas coffee grew cold again she sat up against the headboard of slades bed with a pile of manuscript on either side of her the stack of pages she had read was rapidly outgrowing the pile she had yet to read engrossed she had been able to pass off betsys nagging when the housekeeper had brought up a tray of soup and sandwiches jessica had given her an absent promise to eat which she had forgotten the moment the door was closed again shed forgotten too though he had scrawled notes and revisions in the margins that she was reading slades work the story the people had completely taken her over she traveled with an ordinary family through the postwar forties through the simplicities and complexities of the fifties into the sixties with their turbulence and fluctuating mores children grew up values changed there were deaths and births the realization of some dreams and the destruction of others through it all as a new generation coped with the pressures of the seventies jessica came to know them they were people she might have met undeniably people she would have cared for the words flowed at times gently at other times with a grittiness that made her stomach tighten it wasnt an easy story his characters were too genuine for that he showed her things she didnt always want to be shown but she never considered setting the pages aside at the end of a chapter jessica reached automatically for the next page confused she glanced down to see that there were no more annoyed with the interruption she then realized she had read all he had given her for the first time in almost three hours the sound of slades typing penetrated her concentration there was a full moon that too came to her abruptly the light flowed into the room to vie with the stream of the bedside lamp the fire slade had lit when theyd come upstairs had burned down to glowing embers jessica stretched her cramped muscles wanting to give herself a moment before she went into slade when she had insisted on reading his work jessica hadnt been certain how she would feel or what she would say to him when she was finished knowing herself too easily influenced by emotion she had been certain that she would find some merit in his writing now she wanted time to decide how much her feelings for slade had to do with her feelings about the story she had just read none she realized before she had completed the first chapter jessica had forgotten why she was reading it even though her main purpose had been accomplished she knew slade better now he had a depth of perception she had only sensed an insight into people she envied as well as admired in his writing as well as his speech he was frugal with words but in the writing his inner thoughts surfaced he might be sparing with his own emotions but his characters had a range to them that were rooted in their creator and jessica mused shed been wrong when she had once told him he didnt know women he knew them almost too well she thought as she fingered the tip of a page how much did he see when he looked at her that she had been confident was private how much did he understand when he touched her that she had been certain she could keep hidden did he know she loved him instinctively jessica glanced at the doorway that separated the bedroom and the sitting room slades typing continued no she was certain he had no idea how deep her feelings ran or she thought with a small smile that she was determined not to let him walk out of her life whenever or however things were resolved if he knew she mused hed put her at arms length a cautious man she reflected slade was a very cautious man one who saw himself suited for the solitary life jessica decided that he had some surprises coming when she felt her life was her own again she was going to deal him a few she rose and went to the doorway his back was to her the light falling on his hands as they moved over the keys from the set of his shoulders the angle of his head she could tell his concentration was deep not wanting to disturb him she waited resting against the doorjamb the ashtray at his elbow was half full with a lit cigarette smoldering and forgotten his coffee cup was empty but his dinner tray hadnt been touched she felt a betsylike urge to scold him for neglecting to eat this is how it could be she realized abruptly if the nightmare was behind us he could work here and id hear the sound of his typing when i came home thered be times hed get up in the middle of the night and close the door so the noise wouldnt wake me wed walk on the beach on sunday mornings watch the fire on rainy afternoons one day she thought and closed her eyes it could happen one day with an exasperated sigh slade stopped typing one hand reached up to rub at the stiffness in his neck whatever impetus had driven him for three hours had suddenly dried up and he wasnt ready automatically he reached for his coffee only to find the cup empty maybe if he went down for some more the flow would come back even as he considered it jessica came to him wrapping her arms around his neck she rested her cheek on top of his head love was coursing through her swiftly too swiftly she squeezed him tightly forcing back the words she was afraid he wasnt ready to hear there were others she wanted to say first slade dont ever stop doing what you were meant to do not sure of her meaning he frowned down at the words hed just written how much did you read all you gave me not enough when will you finish oh slade its wonderful jessica continued before he could speak its a beautiful piece of work everything the words the feeling the people slade turned so that he could see her face he didnt want platitudes not from her her eyes were lit with enthusiasm while his remained cool and guarded why because you told a story with depth about people all of us have met or have been she spread her fingers searching for words that would satisfy him because it made me cry and cringe and laugh there were parts that scene in the parking lot in the seventh chapter i didnt want to read it was hard savage but i had to read it even when it hurt slade no one that reads that is going to be untouched she laid her hands back on his shoulders and isnt that why a writer writes his eyes never left hers he waited weighing what he saw there with her words you know he said slowly i dont think i realized until just now what a chance i was taking by letting you read it a chance she repeated why if you hadnt been touched im not sure i could have finished it nothing he could have said would have meant more jessica brought his hand up to her cheek wondering if he realized how much hed said in one sentence i was touched slade she said quietly when its published and i read it im going to remember that part of it was written right here going to erect a monument he asked with a smile just a discreet plaque leaning over she kissed him i wouldnt want it to go to your head what about an agent she asked suddenly do you have one chuckling he drew her down into his lap yes i have one so far we havent done each other much good but hes marketed some short stories and hes doing whatever it is agents do to sell my other novel the other one jessica drew away as slade began to nibble on her ear its finished then mmmhmm come back here he demanded wanting to taste that soft sensitive spot at the curve of her shoulder whats it about she demanded eluding him when can i read it is it as good as this one has anyone ever told you that you ask too many questions his hand slipped under her sweater to cup her breast with his thumb he flicked lazily over the point feeling it harden as her heartbeat went from steady to erratic i like that he murmured nipping at the cord of her neck i can feel your pulse go crazy everywhere i touch in one long stroke he moved down her rib cage to her waist youre losing weight he said with a frown youre already too thin did you eat any dinner has anyone ever told you that you talk too much jessica asked before she pressed her lips to his his answer was a low sound of pleasure she tasted warm more pungent than sweet as the tip of her tongue slipped to his to tantalize then retreated to provoke he thought he heard her laugh low and husky before he gripped the back of her neck in his hand and plunged deep her scent and her taste were the same so that he felt himself surrounded by her before slade could rise to carry her to the bed jessica was pulling him to the floor there was a sudden urgency in her a flash of fire the habitual energy that had been lacking in her all day abruptly surfaced in a torrent of passion she tugged at the buttons of his shirt impatient to have his flesh against hers while her mouth was already making wild passes over his face and throat her aggression both unbalanced and aroused him because he understood that part of it came from a need to block out her fears slade let her lead the pace was hers and it was frantic within moments he was too caught up in her to think at all she was undressing him swiftly her lips following the path of her busy hands until his mind was totally centered on her shivering thoughts quick tastes maddening touches she gave him no time to focus on only one but insisted he experience all in an enervating haze of sensation vulnerability was something new to him but he found himself trapped in a sultry viscous world where he had no guards no defense she was driving him beyond the point of reason but still he couldnt find the will to stop her and take command this time there was only response it poured from him increasing her strength and depleting his when her mouth fixed on his again he fumbled with her sweater he whose hands were always sure found them damp and trembling when at last he could touch her though her flesh was as hot as his she allowed him to linger nowhere moving over him with a speed and agility that left his hands frustrated and his body throbbing skin slid over skin her moist hungry mouth ravaging her soft hands greedy knowing he was helpless excited her this strong man this hard man was completely powerless under her spell but jessica had no spells only needs and love she realized that she loved him more on finding that he could be weak his body was firm and muscled but it shuddered now for her the light from the desk lamp slanted across his face so that she could see his eyes opaque with passion on hers his mouth was tempting and she took it tasting all the hot heady flavors that sprang from desire his breath was warm and ragged as it trembled into her open mouth with sudden clarity she smelled the lemon and beeswax polish from the desk in some sane portion of her mind jessica knew the scent would come back to her whenever she thought of the first time he fully gave himself to her for she had him now mind emotion and body even when he took them back she would have had this one instant in time when he held nothing away from her so she gave herself to him taking him into her on a flash of sharp silvery pleasure her strength soared driving both of them fast and hard until it crested suspending them when it ebbed she seemed to dissolve into him so that they lay entwined joined and sated slade struggled to clear his mind but found that she filled it consumed it the power that had driven her was depleted her body nearly weightless on his but he discovered that she still dominated him he wanted to draw away perhaps to prove to both of them that he could that he had a choice his hands only tangled deeper into her hair until he found the soft slender neck though she lay passive hardly breathing he could feel the hammer of her heart against his no force of will could make his pulses level though his physical need was fully satisfied he wanted her but his wants were only to have her near jess he lifted her face to his without any idea what thoughts would spill out into words her eyes were huge and heavy and shadowed her face was soft with the afterglow of passion and with weariness hed had no right he thought on a quick rage of guilt no right to allow her to use up all her reserves of energy and strength to satisfy his needs no dont jessica could see the change in his face already she thought he was taking back what he had so briefly given her dont shut me out she said quietly dont shut me out so soon without realizing he was doing so he traced her lips with his thumb sleep with me tonight was all he said slade waited until he was certain she slept before he eased from the bed watching jessica he dressed in silence thin moonlight washed over her face and bare shoulders shifting with shadows as a cloud passed over the moon with any luck he calculated that he could give the first floor a thorough check stake out the parlor for a couple of hours then be back without her ever knowing he had gone giving her one last look he slipped from the room with the soundless efficiency that came from years of experience slade tested the multitude of doors and windows he noted with disgust the simple locks that would keep out only the rankest of amateurs the house is full of silver and small portable valuables he reflected a burglars paradise and she seals it off with dimestore locks a credit card and a hairpin slade decided as he examined the rear kitchen door hed have to see that jessica installed something less flimsy before he left in a mound of white fur ulysses slept on the cool tile floor snoring lightly he never stirred as slade stepped over him testing slade rattled the knob on the back door ulysses rhythm never altered wake up you goodfornothing mutt at the command the dog opened one glazed eye thumped his tail twice then went back to sleep rubbing the back of his neck slade reminded himself that a runofthemill burglar wasnt the immediate problem he stepped over the dog again and left him snoring cautiously he moved through the servants wing there was a pale light under one door and the muffled laughter of a latenight talk show the rest were silent glancing at his watch he saw that it was just past midnight slade went back to the parlor to wait he sat in a wingback chair lost in the shadows watch and wait there was little more he could do and he was itching to do something anything to move the investigation along maybe the commissioner picked the wrong man after all he mused this time slade wanted to look for trouble and he wanted to find it whoever had hired the man in the grove was going to pay he had little doubt of that but he wanted to collect personally the woman upstairs in his bed was all that mattered the diamonds were incidental they were just rocks after all with a market value jessica was priceless with a silent laugh he stretched out his legs dodson could hardly have foreseen that his handpicked bodyguard would fall in love with his assignment slade knew his own reputation thorough precise and cool well he thought hed lost his cool almost from the instant hed seen the little blond whirlwind with the viking cheekbones he wasnt thinking like a cop but like a man a man who wanted revenge and that was dangerous as long as he remained on the force he had to play by the rules the first rule was no personal involvement slade nearly laughed aloud at that rule one down the tubes he decided as he dragged a hand through his hair how could he be more personally involved he was already in love with her already her lover if they were any more personal theyd be married and having children that thought stopped him cold he couldnt permit his mind to run in that direction he wasnt for her theyd drift apart once the investigation was over naturally thats what he wanted slade told himself but the frown remained in his eyes he had his own life to deal with the demands of his profession his responsibilities his writing even if there was room in his life for a woman their paths ran in opposite directions they werent about to cross again it was only chance that had brought them together this time circumstances that had brought about an intimacy that had led to emotional attachment hed get over her he pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger the hell he would wasnt a man allowed a few dreams he demanded of himself when he sat alone in the dark in a room that smelled of lemon wax and fall flowers wasnt he allowed to weave some sort of future when a woman lay soft and warm in his bed he was entitled to some basic selfishness wasnt he with a half sigh slade settled against the back of the chair maybe the man was but the cop wasnt and he reminded himself jessica needed the cop more whether she believed it or not blanking out his mind slade waited in the dark for just under three hours instinct told him he was wasting his time some sleep was essential if he was to be alert enough to keep her safe and occupied during the daylight hours stiff from sitting he absently worked out the kinks as he headed back to the stairs another day he mused two at the most if agent brewster was as close as hed led slade to believe fatigue settled over him the moment he allowed his muscles to relax four hours sleep would recharge his system hed gotten by on less quietly he turned the knob of his bedroom door jessica was sitting in the middle of the bed curled into a tight ball she took the deep tearing breaths of a drowning woman fighting for air moonlight pooled over her as she shuddered jess there was a scream rising in her throat when her head jerked up slade saw the wild sheen of fear in her eyes before she focused on him she could hold back the cry by digging her teeth into her lip but the shudders went on slade went to her swiftly her skin was clammy as he took her shoulders her face damp with a mixture of tears and perspiration it ran through his mind that someone had slipped past him and gotten to her then the idea was as quickly dismissed what is it he demanded whats the matter its nothing desperately she fought to control the tremors the nightmare had come back horridly vivid to attack all of her senses cold wind the smell of salt spray the roar of the surf and someones heavy footsteps as they ran after her the shifting shadows as clouds blocked out the sun the iron taste of her own terror and worse much worse she had been afraid to turn afraid she would see the face of someone she loved on the man who pursued her i woke up she managed i guess i panicked when you werent here it was partially true and difficult enough to confess she couldnt bring herself to admit she could be terrorized by a dream i was just downstairs he brushed sweatdampened hair from her cheeks i wanted to make sure everything was locked up professional habit she nearly managed a smile before she dropped her head to his shoulder yeah even as he gathered her close she trembled it wasnt the moment he decided to lecture her on flimsy locks and thin chains ill go down and get you a brandy no she bit her lip again as the refusal came out too forcefully no please i already feel like an idiot youre entitled to be jumpy jess softly he brushed a kiss over her hair she wanted to cling to beg him not to leave her alone for an instant she wanted to pour out every fear and fantasy and dread but she couldnt and the denial was as much for her own sake as his with a policeman in the house she countered tilting back her head she looked up at him a strong face she mused strong arms and serious eyes just come to bed you must be tired making the effort she forced away the nerves and gave him a smile how does one man cope with two careers sergeant he shrugged as he kneaded her tense shoulders i manage how can a woman look so beautiful at three oclock in the morning my mother claims its bone structure her smile warmed a bit as she willed herself to relax under his hands i prefer to think its something less scientific like being born during a lunar eclipse nuzzling her neck he chuckled were you yes my father said thats why i had cats eyes to help me see in the dark slade kissed her lightly before he set her away from him and rose if you dont get some sleep theyre going to be bloodshot what a gallant thing to say jessica frowned at him as he undressed what about you i can get by on three or four hours when i have to she gave a quick snort your machismos surfacing slade when he turned his head the moonlight streamed over his face illuminating the lightningfast grin jessica felt her heart flutter up to her throat shouldnt she be used to him by now she wondered the mercurial moods the streaks of boyish good humor in the sometimes overly serious man his body was sleek and limber streamlined like a channel swimmers muscled like a lightweight boxers his face mirrored both of his professions the intellect and the action hell take care of you her mind comforted just trust but there were lines of fatigue and strain that the moonlight accented as well and you take care of him her thoughts added smiling she held out her arms to him come to bed she ordered lying down beside her slade drew her close there was no driving physical need to possess her instead he felt a simple serenity all the more precious for its rarity for the next few hours they would be any man and woman sharing the intimacy of sleep she curled warmly into him as much to soothe as be soothed there were no more words jessica lay still schooling her breathing so that it was deep and even until she felt him drift off with her eyes open and fear threatening on the verges of her mind she watched the moonlight play on his shoulder as it rose and fell the light was misty with predawn before she slept when the phone rang he jolted out of a restless sleep sweat pearled on his forehead afraid to answer more afraid not to he lifted the receiver yes hello your times up i need more he said quickly knowing that weakness would never be tolerated he swallowed the tremor in his voice just a few days it isnt easy to get to them with the house full of people must i remind you that you arent paid to do only whats easy i tried to get to them last night i was nearly caught then you were careless ive no use for carelessness less for carelessness than weakness he thought rapidly and moistened his lips jessica jessicas not feeling well he reached for a cigarette to steady his nerves he had to think quickly and calmly if he wanted to stay alive she isnt planning on coming into the shop in a couple of days i should be able to convince her to take a long weekend shell listen to me he took a greedy drag of his cigarette praying that he spoke the truth with her out of the house i can get to the diamonds without taking any chances moisture beaded on his top lip and he wiped the back of his hand across it youll have them this weekend a couple of days wont matter a sigh breathed through the phone chilling him youre mistaken again too many mistakes my young friend remember my associate in paris he made mistakes the phone slid wetly in his hand he remembered the man found floating in the seine tonight he said desperately ill have them for you tonight ten oclock at the shop he paused to make certain the weapon of fear had done its work the soft jerky breathing pleased him if you fail this time i wont be so understanding youve done very well since you started to work for me id hate to lose you ill bring them then i then i want out well discuss it ten oclock with a gentle click the connection was broken chapter contents prev next slades mind and body awoke at the same instant the luxury of drifting slowly awake was something he had forfeited years before he had had to perfect the ability to sleep quickly and lightly and to awake just as quickly ready to function it was a habit he looked forward to breaking without really believing he ever would he saw from the slant of the sun that it was still early but he shifted his gaze to check the mantel clock nonetheless just past seven the four hours rest had done all it needed to do turning his head he looked down at jessica the pale blue smudges under her eyes made him frown though by his calculations she had slept nearly eight hours the smudges were deeper than they had been the day before today hed make certain she rested more if he had to slip a sleeping pill into her coffee and ate something if he had to forcefeed her he could all but feel the pounds slipping off her though he barely shifted the mattress as he moved away from her her hand tightened on his arm her eyes flew open get some more sleep he ordered touching his lips to hers what time is it her voice was husky and thick but her hand stayed firm on his arm early jessica relaxed muscle by muscle but didnt release him how early too early he bent to give her another brief kiss before he rose but she pulled him closer too early for what she felt his lips curve against hers youre not even awake yet wanna bet running a hand down she trailed her fingers over his flat stomach the sleepy kiss smoldered with burgeoning passion maybe you cant get by on three or four hours sleep after all cocking his brow he lifted his head wanna bet her answering laugh was smothered by his lips it had never been like this for her each time they made love it stunned her enticed her then consumed her in his arms with his hands and lips running wild and free over her body she could lose herself and how she needed to lose herself hed known from the first how to play her each time they came together he found new variations giving her no opportunity to become familiar with a touch or to anticipate a demand he could dominate her mind so effortlessly plunge her back into a world that was all keen emotion and sharp sensation everything would magnetize from the bare brush of a fingertip to the bruising pressure of lips jessica thought she could feel the individual threads of the sheet against the naked flesh of her back the whispering tick of the clock was like thunder pale sunlight danced gray and ghostly she could see it fall over his hair accenting its dark confusion as she dove her hands into it in her ear he whispered something poetic and foolish about the texture of her skin though the tone was almost reverent his hands were aggressive arousing and drugging in turns murmuring she told him what she wanted shifting she offered what he needed when he took her slade took her slowly watching the flickers of pleasure and passion on her face in the thin morning light savoring the sensations that rippled through him as she moved he nibbled on her parted lips he tasted her and himself before he roamed over her closed lids fragile he thought her skin was so fragile yet all the while her hips urged him to take to take quickly with iron control he kept the rhythm easy prolonging the ultimate delight jess he could hardly form her name between labored breaths open your eyes jess i want to see your eyes the lids fluttered as if weighed down by the pale gold lashes open your eyes love and look at me he wasnt a man for endearments even through the haze of needs and sensations jessica recognized it a new warmth filled her pure emotion to double the physical ecstasy she opened them the irises were opaque rich amber filmed over with passion as he moved inside her the lashes flickered threatening to lower again no look at me his voice had dropped to a rough whisper their lips were close so that their breath merged shudder for shudder jessica saw that his eyes were dark dark gray and intense as if he would look into her mind and read whatever frantic thoughts raced inside tell me that you need me he demanded i have to hear you say it just once jessica struggled to form words as she climbed higher toward delirium i need you slade youre the only one his lips crushed down on hers to muffle her cry as he drove her swiftly to the peak his last rational thought was almost a prayer that the words he had demanded would be enough for him strange that his body felt more rested more relaxed now than it had upon waking slade slid down to press a kiss at the hollow between her breasts before he shifted from her now get some more sleep he ordered but before he could rise jessica had her arms locked around his neck ive never been more awake in my life whatre you going to do with me today slade make me fill out more of those silly cards those silly cards he said as he slipped a hand under her knees are a necessary part of any organized library theyre boring she said defiantly when he lifted her spoiled he decided carrying her into the bathroom i certainly am not the line appeared between her brows as he switched on the shower you certainly are he corrected genially but thats all right i kind of like you that way oh well thanks a lot he grinned kissed her then set her down in the shower stall jessica let out one long surprised scream slade its freezing best way to get the blood moving in the morning he stepped in with her partially blocking the spray well second best he amended then cut off a stream of abuse with his lips turn on the hot water she demanded when he let her breathe again im turning blue he picked up her arm giving it a light pinch no not yet he disagreed want the soap ill go take my own shower thanks huffily she tried to climb out only to find herself tangled with him under the icy spray let go this is police brutality she lifted her face to glare at him and got struck fully with the cold needle spray slade sputtering she blinked her eyes to clear them her body was pressed against his frigid and tingling youre going to pay for this i swear you are blinded by the water and her own streaming hair she struggled to free herself with one arm keeping her prisoner slade took his free hand over her lavishly soaping her skin stop it infuriated and aroused jessica fought against him when his hand passed intimately over her bottom she grew more desperate then she heard him chuckle temper had her head snapping back up though the spray made her vision vague and watery you listen to me she began soapy fingers passed over her nipple slade dont with a moan she arched away his palm slipped between her thighs no but her mouth blindly sought his jessica no longer felt the cold when she left the shower she was glowing some color had seeped back into her cheeks slade noted it with a mixture of relief and pleasure though jessica did her best to maintain outward indignance im going to go get dressed she informed him as she wrapped her wet hair in a towel because she was still naked slade found it hard to be offended by her haughty tone refreshed he hooked his own towel around his waist okay ill meet you downstairs for breakfast in ten minutes ill be there she told him grandly as she stooped to pick up his shirt when i get there grinning he watched her slip into his shirt and button it i could get used to seeing you like that he commented when she sent him an arch look his grin only widened wet and half naked he explained its that machismo again jessica muttered holding back the smile turning she flounced to the door ten minutes he reminded her jessica cast a baleful look over her shoulder then slammed the door behind her her grin quickly escaped then almost as quickly faded david stood directly outside her own bedroom door his hand already poised to knock his head had turned at the sound of the slam but he hadnt moved his eyes roamed over her taking in slades shirt the damp glowing skin and sleepstarved eyes well his tone like his eyes turned cool i guess youre already up jessica felt more color flow into her cheeks as close as she and david had been living in the same house they had never chanced upon each other under these circumstances both had always been extremely private about that area of their lives were both adults jessica reminded herself as she walked toward him but theyd been children together yes im up did you want me part of her wanted to run to him as she had the day before part of her no longer trusted so unconditionally guilt gave her a reserve toward him nothing else could have sensing it he became only more distant and disapproving thought id check with you before i went in thats all he gave her another brief telling look since youre busy im not busy david come in coolly polite jessica opened the bedroom door then gestured him inside it never occurred to her that she was breaking one of slades rules by talking to david alone even if it had she would have done no differently were there any problems yesterday i should know about no his eyes rested on the bed which hadnt been slept in his voice tightened nothing to worry about obviously youve got enough to keep you busy dont be sarcastic david it doesnt suit you she took the towel from her hair and flung it aside if you have something to say to me come out with it she plucked up a comb and began to drag it through her hair do you know what youre doing he blurted out jessicas hand paused in midstroke slowly she lowered the comb to place it back on the dresser she caught a glimpse of herself pale shadoweyed damp and inadequately covered in slades wrinkled shirt be specific youre sleeping with the writer shoving up his glasses he took a step toward her and if i am she countered tightly why should you object what do you know about him david demanded with such sudden heat that she was rendered speechless he comes out of nowhere probably without two nickels to rub together its a nice setup here big house free meals a willing woman be careful david she stiffened as the anger in her eyes met his how do you know hes not just a sponge a couple million dollars is a hell of a target the angry color paled with hurt and of course what else could he be interested in other than my money when she would have turned away he took her shoulders come on jessie the eyes behind the glasses softened you know i didnt mean it that way but hes a stranger and youre well youre just too trusting am i david she swallowed the sudden rise of tears as she studied his wellknown face have i made a mistake by trusting i dont want you to get hurt he squeezed her shoulders before he dropped his hands you know i love you the admission seemed to make him uncomfortable with a shrug he stuck his hands in his pockets and damn it jessica you must know how crazy michael is about you hes been in love with you for years but im not in love with him she said quietly im in love with slade in love with him jeez jessie you hardly know the guy the use of the silly exclamation brought a quick laugh from her as she dragged a hand through her hair oh david i know him better than you think look let me check into him a little bit maybe find out no swiftly jessica cut him off no david i wont permit that slade is my business so was that creep from madison avenue who soaked you for ten thousand he muttered turning away she covered her face with her hands it was funny she thought she should be able to laugh two of the most important people in her life were warning her about each other hey jessica im sorry awkwardly david patted her wet hair that was a dumb thing to say ill butt out just well just be careful okay he shifted from one foot to the other wondering why she was suddenly so emotional youre not going to cry or anything are you no that did nudge a small laugh from her he sounded suspiciously as he had when hed been twelve and shed come home after fighting with her current boyfriend loyalty came full circle overlapping everything else david turning jessica laid her hands on his shoulders looking beyond the lenses and deep into his eyes if you were in trouble if youd gotten in over your head and made a mistake a serious one would you tell me his eyes narrowed slightly but she couldnt tell if it was from curiosity or guilt i dont know i guess it would depend it wouldnt matter what youd done david id always be on your side the tone was too serious uncomfortable he shrugged his thin shoulders and tried to lighten it im going to remind you of that the next time you jump me for making a mistake in the books jessie you really dont look good you ought to think about getting away for a few days ill be fine sensing an argument she continued but ill give it some thought good ive got to go i told michael id open up today he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek im sorry if i came on too strong before i still think hesitating he shifted his shoulders again well weve all got to do things our own way yes she murmured as she watched him walk to the door yes we do david if you or michael need money are we going to get a raise he asked with a quick grin as he turned the knob forcing a smile jessica picked up her comb again well see about it when i come back to work hurry back he said then left her alone jessica stared at the closed door then down at the comb in her hand on a sudden spurt of rage she hurled it across the room look at what shed been doing pumping him half hoping hed confess so that she could see an end to things shed watched him searching for some sign of guilt and she wouldnt be able to prevent herself from doing the same with michael her own lack of trust appalled her dropping onto the stool of her vanity she stared at her reflection it wasnt right that she should feel this way alienated from the two people shed felt closest to watching for signs waiting for them to make a mistake worse she thought worse wanting them to make one so that she could stop the watching and waiting she took a long hard look at herself her hair was wet and tangled around an unnaturally pale face the pallor only accented the smudges under her eyes she looked frail already half beaten that she could put an end to with a few basic practicalities stiffening her spine jessica began to dab makeup on the smudges if an illusion of strength was all she had left shed make the best of it when the phone rang across the room she jolted knocking a small china vase to the floor helplessly she stared at the shattered pieces that could never be put back together betsy answered the phone as slade reached the bottom of the stairs yes hes here may i say whos calling she stopped slade with an arch look as she held out the receiver its a mrs sladerman she said primly frowning slade took the receiver mom betsy sniffed at that and walked away why are you calling me here you know im working is anything wrong he demanded as annoyance turned to concern is janice all right nothings wrong and janice is fine his mother put in the moment he let her speak and how are you annoyance returned swiftly mom you know youre not supposed to call when im working unless its important if the plumbings gone again just call the super i could probably have figured that one out all by myself mrs sladerman considered look i should be home in a couple of days just put whatever it is on hold until i get there all right she said mildly but you did tell me to let you know if i heard anything from your agent well talk about it when you get home goodbye slade wait a minute letting out an impatient breath he shifted the phone to his other hand you didnt have to call to pass on another rejection no she agreed but i thought maybe i should call with an acceptance he started to speak then stopped himself anticipation only led to disappointment on the new short story for mirror now he did mention something about that too she let the sentence trail off until slade was ready to shout at her but he was so excited about selling the novel that i didnt take it all in slade felt the blood pounding in his ears what novel your novel idiot she said with a laugh second chance by james sladerman soon to be published by fullbright and company emotion raced through him too swiftly resting his forehead against the receiver he closed his eyes hed waited all of his life for this one moment now nothing seemed ready to function he tried to speak found his throat closed then cleared it are you sure am i sure she muttered slade do you think i cant understand english even if its fancy agent talk he said theyre working up a contract and hell be in touch with the details business about film rights and serial rights and clauses with numbers of course she added when her son remained silent its up to you if you dont want the fiftythousanddollar advance she waited then gave a maternal sigh you always were a quiet one slade but this is ridiculous doesnt a man say something when he finally has what hes always wanted always wanted he thought numbly of course shed known how could he have ever deceived himself into thinking hed concealed it from her the money hadnt sunk in he was still hearing the magic word published i cant think he said finally well when you can get the one youre working on now together they want to see it seems they think theyve got a tiger by the tail slade i wonder if ive told you often enough that im proud of you yeah he let out a long breath you have thanks her chuckle was warm in his ear thats right darling save your words for your stories i have a few hundred phone calls to make now i love to brag congratulations thanks he said again inadequately mom yes buy a new piano she laughed goodbye slade he listened to the dial tone for nearly a full minute excuse me mr sladerman would you like your breakfast now confused slade turned to stare at betsy she stood behind him little black eyes wrinkled skin and graying hair on short sturdy legs she smelled faintly of silver polish and lavendar sachet the smile slade gave her had her taking a cautious step back it looked a bit crazed youre beautiful she backed up another step sir absolutely beautiful swooping her up he spun her in a fast circle then kissed her full on the mouth betsy managed one muffled shriek her lips tingled for the first time in ten years put me down and behave yourself she ordered clinging to her dignity betsy im crazy about you crazy period she corrected refusing to be charmed by the gleam in his eye just like a writer to be nipping at the brandy before breakfast put me down and ill fix you some nice black coffee im a writer he told her with something like wonder in his voice yes indeed she said soothingly put me down like a good boy jessica stopped halfway down the steps to stare was that slade grinning like a madman and holding her housekeeper two feet off the ground her mouth dropped open as he planted another kiss on betsys staunch unpainted lips slade taking betsy with him he turned it flashed through jessicas mind that it was the first time she had seen him fully completely happy youre next he announced as he set betsy back on her feet pixilated betsy told jessica with a knowing nod before breakfast published slade corrected as he swung jessica from the stairs before breakfast his mouth crushed hers before she had a chance to speak she felt the emotion coming from him in sparks hard clean emotion without eddies or undercurrents the joy transferred into her so that she was laughing even as her mouth was freed published your novel when how yes yes he kissed her again before continuing to answer her questions in turn i just got a call fullbright and company accepted my manuscript and want to see the one im working on something changed in his eyes as he drew her back against him she saw it only briefly it wasnt a loss of happiness but a full dawning of realization my lifes my own he murmured its finally mine oh slade jessica clung to him needing to share the moment im so happy for you lifting her face she framed his in her hands its just the beginning nothing will stop you now i can feel it betsy we need champagne she said as she wrapped her arms around slades neck again at nine oclock in the morning the sentence trembled with righteous shock we need champagne at nine oclock on this morning jessica told her right away in the parlor were celebrating with her tongue clucking rapidly betsy moved down the hall writers she reminded herself were hardly better than artists and everyone knew the sort of lives they led still he was a charming devil she allowed herself one undignified chuckle before she went into the kitchen to report the goingson to the cook come inside jessica ordered tell me everything thats everything slade told her as she pulled him into the parlor they want the book thats the important thing ill have to get the details from my agent the figure of fifty thousand finally registered fully ill get an advance he added with a half laugh enough to keep me going until i sell the second one that wont be long i read it remember on a sudden burst of energy she grabbed his hand what a movie it would make think of it slade you could do the screenplay youll have to be careful with the film rights make sure you dont sign away something you shouldnt or a miniseries she decided yes thats better then you could ever thought about giving up antiques and opening an agency he asked mildly negotiatings negotiating she countered then smiled and im an artist with her face set in lines of disapproval betsy entered carrying a tray will there be anything else miss winslow when betsy used such formal address jessica knew she had sunk beyond reproach no nothing thank you betsy she waited until the housekeeper had disappeared before casting slade a baleful glance thats your fault really she informed him shell be polite and longsuffering all day now because you molested her and i joined you in champagne depravity before breakfast we could ask her to have a glass he suggested as he worked the cork from the bottle you really do want me to be in trouble jessica lifted both glasses as the cork popped out to writing james sladerman on one of those necessary cards in my library she said when both glasses were full laughing he clinked his rim against hers youll have the first copy he promised then drained his glass how do you feel slade sipping more cautiously jessica watched him refill his glass how do you feel really he studied the bubbles in the wine as if searching for the word free he said quietly i feel free shaking his head he began to wander the room after all these years of doing what i had to ill have the chance to do what i want to the money just means that i wont starve doing it even after this last years tuition is paid but now the doors open its open he repeated and i can walk through it jessica moistened her lips and swallowed youll quit the force now i intended to next year he toyed with the wick of a candle on the piano a restlessness crept into the other feelings a restlessness he hadnt permitted himself to acknowledge before this means it can be sooner much sooner ill be a civilian she thought of the gun he secreted somewhere in his rooms upstairs relief flowed through her to be immediately followed by anxiety i guess itll take some getting used to ill manage youll resign right away no need to wait he considered ive got enough to get by on until the contracts signed ill need time if they want rewrites then theres this novel to finish and another ive been kicking around i wonder how itll feel to write fulltime instead of grabbing snatches its what you were meant to do she murmured as soon as this is over im going to find out over her eyes fixed on his but he wasnt looking at her youre staying what distracted he brought his gaze back to her the expression on her face made him frown what did you say i thought youd turn over the assignment to someone else jessica reached for the bottle to add champagne to a glass that was already full youll want to get back to new york right away with deliberate care slade set down his glass i dont leave things until theyre finished no she set the bottle back down no of course you wouldnt you think id walk out of here and leave you the anger in his voice had her taking a quick sip of champagne i think she said slowly when someones about to get what theyve worked for waited for they shouldnt take any chances he went to her and took the glass from her hand then set it beside the halffilled bottle i think you should shut the hell up when she started to speak he cupped her face in one strong hand i mean it jess youre a fool to stay when you have a choice she blurted out his eyes narrowed with temper before he brought his mouth to hers for one brief hard kiss youre a fool to think i have one but you do jessica corrected more calmly i told you once before we always have a choice all right slade nodded never taking his eyes off hers say the word and ill go back to new york today if youll go with me he added when she started to speak her answer was a quick defiant shake of the head then were in this together until the finish jessica went into his arms and clung she needed him to stay as badly as she wanted him to go for now she would only think of tomorrows just remember i gave you your chance you wont get another one tilting her head back she smiled at him one day im going to remind you of it were in this together he nodded again not noting that she had edited his phrase okay lets get some breakfast to go with this champagne before betsy completely writes you off chapter contents prev next for jessica the day crawled the confinement alone would have been torture to her she hated seeing the sun pour through the windows while she remained trapped inside even the beach was off limits so she was prevented from learning if she could walk there again without looking over her shoulder thinking of her shop only brought on a dull nagging headache the one thing shed conceived and built by herself had been taken out of her hands perhaps she would never feel the same pride in it the same dedication to making it the best she was capable of worse her own weariness was taking her to the point where she no longer cared jessica detested being ill her usual defense against a physical weakness was to ignore it and go on it was something she couldnt or wouldnt change now however she had no outlet the quiet library and monotonous tasks slade gave her were grating on already taut nerves finally she tossed her pen across the table and sprang up i cant stand this anymore she gestured widely to encompass the library at large slade if i write one more word ill go crazy isnt there something we can do anything this waiting is unbearable slade leaned back in his chair listening calmly to her complaints hed watched her fidget throughout the morning fighting off boredom tension and exhaustion the only surprise he felt was that shed managed to go so long without exploding sitting still he mused was not jess winslows forte he pushed aside a pile of books gin he stated mildly jessica plunged her hands into the pockets of her trousers damn it slade i dont want a drink i need to do something rummy he finished as he rose rummy for a moment she looked puzzled then gave a gusty sigh cards im ready to beat my head against the wall and you want to play cards yeah got any i suppose jessica dragged a hand through her hair holding it back from her face a moment before she dropped her arm to her side is that the best you can come up with no slade came to her to run his thumb along the shadows under her eyes but i think weve given betsy enough shocks for today with a half length jessica gave in all right then cards she went to a table and pulled open a drawer what stakes she asked as she rummaged around in the drawer your capitals a bit bigger than mine slade said dryly half a penny a point okay big spender jessica located a pack of cards then flourished them prepare to lose and he did resoundingly at slades suggestion they had settled in the parlor his thoughts had been that the sofa and a quiet fire would relax her and a steady boring game might put her to sleep hed already concluded that asleep was the only way jessica could handle the waiting without losing her mind he hadnt expected her to know a great deal about the game any more than he had expected to be trounced gin jessica announced again he looked down in disgust at the cards she spread ive never seen anyone with that kind of luck skill she corrected picking up the cards to shuffle them his opinion was a brief fourletter word ive worked vice he told her while she dealt i know a hustle when i see one vice jessica poked her tongue in her cheek im sure that was very interesting it had its moments he muttered scowling at the cards shed dealt him what department are you with now homicide oh she swallowed but managed to keep her voice light i suppose that has its moments too he gave her a grunt that might have been agreement as he discarded jessica plucked it up and slipped it into her own hand when slade narrowed his eyes she only smiled you must have met a lot of people in your work she contemplated her hand then tossed out a card thats why your characters have such depth briefly he thought of the street people dealers and prostitutes petty thieves and victims still she was right in her way by the time hed hit thirty slade had thought hed seen all there was to see he was constantly finding out there was more yeah i meet a lot of people he discarded again and again jessica plucked it up busted a few professional card sharks jessica sent him an innocent look really one was a greatlooking redhead he improvised ran a portable game in some of the best hotels in new york soft southern accent white hands and a marked deck experimentally he held a card to the light before he discarded it she went up for three years is that so jessica shook her head as she reached for the card gin come on jess theres no way apologetically she spread her cards there seems to be after a quick scan of her cards he swore okay thats it slade tossed in his hand figure up my losses im finished well lets see jessica chewed on the end of a pencil as she scanned the notepad dotted with numbers from previous hands you got caught with a bundle that time didnt you not bothering to wait for his reply she scribbled on the pad the way i figure it you owe me eight dollars and fiftyseven and a half cents setting down the pad she smiled at him lets just make it eight dollars and fiftyseven even youre all heart jess just pay up she held out a hand palm up unless you want to go for double or nothing not a chance slade reached into his pocket and drew out his wallet he tossed a ten onto the table i havent got any change you owe me a buck fortythree with a smirk jessica rose to retrieve her purse from the hall closet one dollar she said rummaging through her billfold as she came back into the parlor and twentyfive thirty fortythree she dropped the change into his hand then grinned were even not by a long shot slade grabbed her and gave her a long thorough kiss if youre going to fleece me he murmured gathering her hair in one hand the least you can do is make it worth my while seems reasonable she agreed as she offered her lips again god how he wanted her not just for a moment or a day or a year he thought as he lost himself in the taste of her for always forever all those terms he never allowed himself to think there was a wall between them the thin glass wall of status he forgot when she was in his arms he had no business feeling what he felt or asking what he wanted to ask but she was warm and soft and her lips moved willingly under his jess dont talk she wrapped her arms tighter around him just kiss me again her mouth clung to his smothering the words that begged to be said and the longer the kiss went on the thinner the wall between them became slade thought he could feel it crack then shatter without a sound jess he murmured again as he buried his face in her hair i want she jolted and slade swore when the doorbell rang ill get it she said no let betsy he held her another minute feeling the hammer of her heart against his chest more than willing jessica nodded when slade released her she sank into a chair its silly she began then michael walked into the parlor jessica ignoring slade michael went to her to take her hand youre so pale you should be in bed she smiled but couldnt prevent her fingers from tightening on his you know id go crazy if i stayed in bed i told you not to worry michael how could i help it he lifted her hand to brush his fingers over the knuckles especially with david muttering all afternoon about you not knowing how to take care of yourself that was she broke off casting a quick look at slade that was just a small disagreement we had im fine really you dont look fine you look exhausted frowning michael followed the direction of her gaze until he too looked at slade understanding was followed by anger resentment then weary acceptance she should be in bed he told slade curtly not entertaining guests slade shrugged as he eased himself into a chair its not my place to tell jess how to run her life and what exactly is your place michael please jessica cut off slades answer and rose hastily ill be going up soon i am tired with a silent plea she turned to slade ive kept you from your work too long you havent written all day no problem he pulled out a cigarette ill make it up this evening michael stood between them obviously not wanting to leave and knowing there was no point in staying ill go now he said at length if you promise to go up to bed yes i will michael she put her arms around him feeling the familiar trim build smelling the light seabreeze scent of his aftershave you and david mean so much to me i wish i could tell you david and i he said quietly and brushed a hand down her hair yes i know he cast slade a last look before he drew her away good night jessica good night michael slade waited until he heard the front door close what kind of disagreement did you have with david it was nothing to do with this it was personal nothings personal right now this was turning she fixed him with weary eyes but he saw the stubborn crease between her brows i have a right to some privacy slade i told you not to see either of them alone he reminded her book me she snapped dont tempt me he met her angry eyes directly and dont do it again yes sergeant on a disgusted sigh jessica dragged a hand through her hair im sorry dont apologize he told her briefly just do what youre told i think i will go up im tired she added not looking at slade good he didnt get up nor did he take his eyes off her get some sleep yes yes i will good night slade he listened to her go up the steps then tossed his cigarette into the fire and swore upstairs jessica filled the tub that was what she needed she told herself an aspirin for the headache a hot tub for the tension then she would sleep she had to sleep her body was crying for it for the first time in her life jessica felt the near weightlessness of true exhaustion she waited until the bathroom was steamy then lowered herself into the tub she knew she hadnt deceived slade jessica wasnt fool enough to believe that hed taken her excuse of being tired at face value he was just as cognizant of what was going on inside her head as she was the visit from michael had been the last straw in a day filled with unspoken fears and rippling tension nothing had happened she thought in frustration as she let the water lap over her how much longer would she have to wait another day a week two weeks on a long quiet sigh she shut her eyes jessica understood her own personality too well she would be lucky to get through the night much less another week of waiting and wondering take an hour at a time she advised herself it was seven oclock shed concentrate on getting through until eight at twenty past eight slade went systematically through the first floor checking locks hed waited throughout an unbearably long day for the phone call that would tell him his assignment was over silently he cursed interpol the fbi and dodson as far as he was concerned they were all equally to blame jessica wouldnt be able to take much more that had been made abundantly clear during michaels visit another thing had been made abundantly clear slade had found himself entirely too close to stepping over the last boundary if the doorbell hadnt rung he would have said things best left unsaid asked things he had no right to ask of a vulnerable woman she might have said yes would have said yes he corrected as he stepped past a snoring ulysses and would have regretted it he reflected when the situation changed and her life was back to normal what if he had asked her then theyd been married before shed had time to readjust a good way to mess up two lives slade he told himself it was better to make the break now draw back until they were just cop and assignment again at least she was upstairs resting not beside him tempting him to cross the line again when she wasnt there where he could see her touch her it was easier to keep things in perspective the servants were settled in their wing he could hear the low murmur of a television and the settling of boards after hed finished checking the locks hed go upstairs and write slade rubbed a hand over the back of his neck where the tension concentrated then hed sleep in his own bed alone as he walked toward the kitchen door slade saw the knob slowly turn muscles tensed he stepped back into the shadows and waited eightthirty jessica glanced at the clock again as she roamed her bedroom neither the bath nor the aspirin had relaxed her enough to bring sleep any closer if slade would come up she thought then shook her head she was becoming too dependent and that wasnt like her still she felt that her nerves would calm somewhat if she could just hear the sound of his typewriter an hour at a time she reminded herself glancing at the clock yet again well shed made it from seven to eight but she wasnt going to make it until nine giving up jessica started back downstairs if hes annoyed she mused shed just have to make the best of it being confined in the house was bad enough without restricting herself to her rooms shed almost be willing to fill out some more of those silly cards anything to keep her hands busy until her thoughts broke off as she came to the foot of the stairs for the second time the parlor doors were closed a tremor ran up her back urging her to turn around go to her room and pretend shed never left it shed taken the first step in retreat before she stopped herself hadnt she told slade not to tell her to run this was her home jessica reminded herself as she stepped forward whatever happened in it was hers to deal with taking a deep breath she opened the parlor doors and flicked on the light switch slade waited as the rear door opened quietly at first there was only a shadow but the build was familiar relaxing he stepped forward into the moonlight startled david whirled around and swore you scared the hell out of me david complained as he let the door swing shut behind him whatre you doing standing around in the dark just checking the locks slade said easily moving right in david muttered after turning on the lights he went over to the stove want some coffee he asked grudgingly thanks slade straddled a chair and waited for david to come out with whatever was on his mind the last report slade had received from brewster had put david in the clear his name and face and fingerprints had been run through the most sophisticated computers his every movement had been under surveillance for over a month david ryce was exactly what he seemed a young faintly defiant man who had a knack for figures and an affection for antiques he was also having what he thought was a discreet affair with a premed student slade recalled brewsters almost paternal amusement with davids infatuation though hed felt an initial twinge of guilt at keeping the knowledge of davids clean slate from jessica slade had decided she had enough trouble keeping herself under control better that she suspected both men than for her to be certain that michael adams was up to his neck in the smuggling operation michael jessica stared facing the truth and not wanting to believe it jessica he stood with pieces of the desk in his hand frantically searching for some viable excuse for his presence and his actions i didnt want to disturb you id hoped youd be asleep yes im sure you did with a quiet resigned sigh she shut the parlor doors at her back there was a problem with this piece michael began i wanted to please dont jessica crossed the room poured two fingers of brandy and drank it down i know about the smuggling michael she told him in a flat voice i know youve been using the shop smuggling really jessica i said dont she whirled sharply pushed by anger and despair i know michael and so do the police oh god as his color drained he looked around wildly was there anyplace left to run i want to know why her voice was low and steady you owe me that i was trapped he let the pieces of the desk fall to the floor then groped for a cigarette jessica i was trapped he promised you wouldnt be involved that youd never have to know you have to believe that id never have gotten you mixed up in this if thered been any choice choice she murmured thinking of slade we all have our choices michael what was yours in europe a couple of years ago i he took a greedy drag of his cigarette i lost some money a lot of money more than i had to lose and to the wrong person he sent her a swift pleading look he had me worked over you might remember when i took those extra two weeks in rome he drew in and expelled smoke quickly they were pros it was days before i could walk when he gave me an alternative to crippling me permanently i took it dragging a hand through his hair michael walked over to the bar he poured bourbon neat splattering drops then downed it in one swallow he knew who i was of course my family my connection with your shop your unimpeachable reputation the liquor gave him temporary strength his voice steadied it worked beautifully for him it wasnt for the money jessica i just wanted to stay alive and then i was in too deep she felt something soften inside her and quickly pushed it aside no pity she ordered herself he wouldnt drag pity from her now who is he michael no shaking his head he turned to face her i wont tell you that if he found out you had his name youd never be safe safe she laughed shortly if you were concerned for my safety you might have told me not to walk on the beach when someone was going to shoot at me shshoot good god jessica i didnt think hed he threatened but i never believed hed actually try to hurt you i would have done something his hand trembled spilling ash onto the carpet with a jerky movement of his arm michael tossed the cigarette into the fire i begged him not to involve you swore id do anything he wanted if hed leave you out of it i love you jessica dont talk about loving to me with more control than she was feeling jessica bent over to pick up one of the pieces he had dropped it was part of the inner molding whats in the desk michael diamonds he said and swallowed a quarter of a million if i dont take them to him tonight where she interrupted to the shop ten oclock let me see them she watched him separate one of the partitions of a cubbyhole from the space where a drawer had been lifting a thin piece of wood he revealed a false bottom he drew out a small padded bag its the last time he began clutching the bag in his palm ive already told him im through as soon as i deliver these im going to leave the country it is the last time jessica agreed then held out her hand but youre not delivering anything im taking the diamonds michael theyre going back where they came from and youre going to the police you might as well hold a gun to my head he swiped an unsteady hand over his mouth hell kill me jessica if he finds out i went to the police i wouldnt even be safe in a cell hell kill me and if he knows what youve done hell kill you too dont be a fool eyes glittering she grabbed the bag from his hand hell kill you anyway and me is he stupid enough not to know the police are closing in she demanded is he stupid enough to leave you alive as a liability think she ordered impatiently your only chance is with the police michael her words touched off a fear hed buried deep inside his mind michael had always known his involvement in the operation could only end one way that fear much more than money had kept him loyal not the police again his eyes darted around the room i have to get away dont you see jessica someplace where he wont find me let me have the diamonds i can use them no her hand tightened on the bag you used me no more for gods sake jessica do you want to see me dead his breathing was raw and jerky as the words tumbled out i dont have time to raise the money ill need if i leave now ill have a start she stared at him a thin film of sweat covered his face beading over lips that trembled his eyes were glazed with terror hed used her she thought but that didnt kill the feelings she had for him if he was determined to run shed give him what he wanted jessica crossed to a painting of a french landscape and swung it out on hidden hinges revealing a wall safe quickly she twirled the tumblers and opened it take this she offered michael a stack of bills its not worth what the diamonds are but cash should be safer in any case it wont take you far enough michael she said quietly as he reached for the money but you have to make your own decision theres only one i can make he slipped the bills inside his jacket then finally met her eyes im sorry jessica nodding she turned away she heard his footsteps as he crossed to the doors michael was david involved in this no david did nothing but take what he thought were routine orders he saw everything hed ever wanted everything hed ever cared about slipping through his hands jessica just go michael when you run you have to run fast she listened for the click of the doors before she opened the padded bag a cold sparkling stream of diamonds fell into her palm so this is what my lifes worth she murmured carefully she replaced them then stared at the remains of the queen anne desk all for a whim she whispered if she hadnt had that impulse to bring the desk home then with a fierce shake of her head jessica broke off the thought there were no ifs she needed to see slade but she needed a moment to herself first on a sigh she sank into a chair letting the bag of diamonds fall into her lap i guess jessica told you about this morning as the coffee heated on the stove david reached for cups slade lifted a brow what was this he wondered shouldnt she have he countered look i dont have anything against you i dont even know you david turned tossing back the hair that fell over his brow but jessies important to me when i saw her come out of your room this morning i didnt like it he measured the man across the room and knew he was outmatched i still dont like it slade watched the eyes behind the lenses so this was her private disagreement jessica had the loyalty she expected here he mused id say you dont have to like it slade said slowly but jess wouldnt feel that way uncomfortable under the direct stare david shifted a bit i dont want her to get hurt neither do i david frowned something about the way slade said it made him believe it shes a soft touch temper leaped into the gray eyes so quickly david nearly backed away when slade spoke the words were soft and deadly controlled im not interested in her money okay sorry relaxing a bit david shrugged its just that shes gotten stung before she trusts everybody shes really smart you know for a scatterbrain who forgets what shes doing because shes doing twenty things at once but with people jessica wears blinders the coffee began to boil over behind him david spun around and turned off the burner look forget i said anything she told me this morning it was none of my business and it isnt except that well i love her you know he mumbled hows she feeling shell be better soon boy i hope so he said fervently as he brought the coffee to the table i wouldnt want her to hear me say it but i could use her at the shop between getting the new stock checked in and michaels moodiness david grimaced and dumped milk into his coffee michael slade prompted casually yeah well i guess everybodys entitled to a few temper tantrums michael just never seems to have a temper at all he flashed slade a grin jessica would call it breeding maybe he has something on his mind david moved his shoulders absently before he drank still i havent seen him this unraveled since the mixup on the chippendale cabinet last year oh some wells slade mused took no priming at all it was my fault david went on but i didnt know hed bought it for a specific customer we do that sometimes but he always lets jessie or me know it was a beauty david remembered dark kingwood great marquetry decoration mrs leeman bought it the minute it was uncarted she was standing in the shop when the shipment came in took one look and wrote out a check michael got back from europe the day we were packing it for delivery and had a fit he said it had already been sold that hed had a cash advance david took a quick sip of his coffee discovered it was bitter and drank again resignedly the paperwork had been mislaid i guess he went on that was odd because jessies a fiend for keeping the invoices in order mrs leeman wasnt too pleased about the mixup either he recalled with a grin jessie sold her a side table at cost to soothe her feathers who bought it slade demanded what the cabinet david adjusted his glasses lord i dont know i dont think michael ever told me and with the mood he was in i didnt like to ask you have the receipt yeah sure puzzled david focused on him again at the shop why i have to go out slade rose swiftly and headed for the rear stairs dont go anywhere until i get back what are you david broke off as slade disappeared upstairs maybe he was a nut after all david mused as he frowned at slades empty chair youre having a casual conversation with a guy and all of a sudden hes make sure jess stays put slade ordered as he came down again his jacket was already zipped over his revolver stays put dont let anyone in the house slade paused long enough to aim hard direct eyes at david no one comes in got it something in the eyes had david nodding without question slade grabbed a napkin and scrawled a number on it if im not back in an hour call this number tell the man who answers the story about the cabinet hell understand the cabinet david stared dumbly at the napkin slade thrust into his hand i dont understand you dont have to just do it the back door slammed behind him yeah sure david grumbled why should i understand anything a loony tune he decided as he stuffed the napkin into his pocket maybe writers were supposed to be loony tunes jessica sure knew how to pick them with a glance at his watch he decided to check on her maybe the writer was a little loose upstairs maybe not but hed managed to unsettle him when david was halfway down the hall the parlor doors opened david jessica closed the distance between them at a run then launched herself into his arms hey what gives he managed to struggle out of her hold and take her by the shoulders is there a different strain of flu running around that affects the brain i love you david close to tears jessica framed his face with her hands he flushed and shifted his weight yeah i love you too look im sorry about this morning well talk about that later theres a lot i have to tell you but i need to see slade first he went out out her fingers dug into davids thin arms where i dont know intently he studied her face jessie youre really sick let me take you upstairs no david its important her voice changed from frantic to stern the one he always responded to you must have some idea where he went i dont he returned a bit indignantly we were sitting there talking one minute and he was up and heading out the next about what impatient jessica gave him a quick shake what were you talking about just this and that i mentioned that michaeld been moody like hed been when wed had that mixup on the chippendale cabinet last year the chippendale jessica pressed her hands to her cheeks oh god yes of course slade gave me some business about not letting anyone in the house and calling some number if he didnt get back in an hour hey where are you going jessica had swung her purse from the newel post and was rummaging through it hes gone to the shop to the shop and its nearly ten where are my keys call call the shop see if he answers in a quick move she dumped the contents of her purse on the floor call she repeated when david gaped at her okay take it easy while jessica made a frantic search through the items on the floor david dialed the phone i cant find them i cant theyre in my coat she remembered and dashed for the hall closet he doesnt answer david told her probably hasnt had time to get there yet if thats where he was going in the first place which doesnt make any sense because its closed and jessie where are you going he said you werent to go out damn it you forgot your coat will you wait a minute but she was already racing down the front steps toward her car chapter contents prev next it took slade only a few moments to pick the lock on the front door of the shop if there was one thing he was going to see to before he left he decided it would be to get jessica to a decent locksmith a miracle she hasnt been cleaned out he mused as he moved through the main shop into the back room blind luck slade concluded then tossed his jacket over a chair moving in the dark he passed through the kitchen into what served as an office there was a large mahogany desk with neat stacks of papers a blotter with names and numbers scribbled on it and a tiffany lamp slade switched it on he caught the boldly printed ulysses needs food on the blotter right beneath the scrawled new mop hndl betsy annoyed with a half grin slade shook his head jessicas idea of organization was beyond him turning away he walked to the file cabinet set in the rear corner the top drawer seemed to be her personal items he found a receipt for a blouse she had bought two years before in a file marked insurance policies shop between two file folders was a wrinkled grocery list on a sound of annoyance he pulled out the second drawer it was the other side of the coin the files were neat legible and in perfect order a quick flip through them showed slade they were receipts for the current year arranged chronologically delivery bills also current and chronological and business correspondence each section was a study in organized filing he thought of the top drawer and shook his head in the third drawer he found what he was looking for receipts from the previous year slade drew out the first file folder and took it to the desk methodically he scanned each one beginning in january he learned nothing else when he had completed the first quarters receipts other than the fact that jessica did a thriving business slade replaced the first folder and drew out the second time ticked away as he examined each paper he drew out a cigarette and worked patiently from month to month he found it in june one chippendale cabinet kingwood with marquetry decoration his brow rose slightly at the price not a bad deal i imagine he murmured noting the name of the purchaser he smiled everyone makes a tidy little profit after pocketing the receipt slade reached for the phone brewster might find davids little story very interesting before he had punched two numbers slade heard the sound of a car pulling up outside swiftly he turned out the light as he moved from the desk he drew out his gun jessica sped along the winding back road that led to her shop if shed had an ounce of sense she berated herself she would have told david to call the number slade had given him why hadnt she at least told him to keep calling the shop until he reached slade nervously she glanced at her watch ten oclock oh god if only the man coming to meet michael were late slade would be in the back room she concluded searching through the old receipts what would the man do when he got to the shop and found slade there instead of michael jessica pressed down harder on the gas and flew around a turn the beams of approaching headlights blinded her overreacting she swerved skidding the left rear wheel on the shoulder of the road heart in her throat she fishtailed spun on gravel then righted the car thats right she thought with her heart pumping wreck the car thatll do everybody a lot of good cursing herself jessica wiped a damp palm on her slacks dont think she ordered herself just drive its less than a mile now even as she said it the car sputtered then bucked frustrated jessica pressed down hard on the accelerator only to have the audi stall then die no infuriated she slammed both hands against the steering wheel the needle on the gas gauge stayed stubbornly on empty how many times she demanded how many times had she told herself to stop and fill up knowing it wasnt the time for selflectures she slammed out of the car leaving it in the middle of the road lights beaming she started to run slade stood pressed behind the doorway that led to the back room he heard the quiet click of the doorknob then the cheery jingle of bells he waited listening to the soft footsteps and gentle breathing then there was a coldly patient sigh dont be childish michael it hardly pays to hide when you leave a car out front in plain view and you should know he added softly theres no place you can hide from me slade hit the overhead lights as he turned into the room chambers isnt it he said mildly with the fetish for snuffboxes he leveled the gun were closed with no change of expression chambers removed his hat youre the stockboy arent you he gave a wheezy chuckle how foolish of michael to send you but then he hasnt the stomach for violence i dont have that problem rippeons in the morgue when chambers gave him a pleasantly blank look slade continued or dont you catch the names of the pros you hire death is an occupational hazard chambers said with an elegant shrug he never bothered to glance at the gun leveled at his chest he knew a man was the real weapon so he watched slades eyes what has michael promised you mr sergeant slade corrected sladerman nypd temporarily attached to the fbi slade caught the faint flicker in chambers eyes the only deal i have with adams is a quiet talk in the near future involving jessica winslow the thought gave slade a moments grim pleasure games up chambers weve had adams under surveillance for some time along with a few other members of your team you were all that was missing a slight miscalculation on my part chambers murmured as he glanced around the shop normally i dont involve myself directly with any of the transports but then miss winslow has such a charming shop i couldnt resist a pity he looked back at slade again you dont look to be the type wholl take a bribe even a lucrative one you seem to be a good judge of character keeping the gun steady slade reached for the phone on the counter with the breath tearing in her lungs jessica dashed the last yards toward the shop she could see the lights glowing behind the drawn shades her thoughts centered solely on slade she hit the door at a full run at a speed unexpected in a man of his bulk chambers grabbed her the moment she stumbled inside his arms slid around her throat before fear could register jessica felt cold steel against her temple slades forward motion stopped with a jerk put down your gun sergeant it seems the game isnt quite over after all when slade hesitated chambers merely smiled i assure you though the gun is small it works very well and at this range he trailed off delicately casting a furious look into jessicas stunned eyes slade let the gun drop okay he held up empty hands let her go chambers gave him a mild smile oh i dont think so it seems i need an insurance policy momentarily mr chambers jessica put a hand to the arm that was constricting her air the sergeant doesnt appreciate your timing miss winslow he said pleasantly however i do very much this shall we say puts a different aspect on things slade shot a quick glance at the clock on his right by his calculations david should be calling his contact within moments the name of the game now was stall you wont have to put a bullet in her he commented if you keep choking her oh i beg your pardon chambers loosened his hold fractionally the gun stayed lodged at her temple greedy for air jessica gasped it in a beautiful creature isnt she he asked slade i often wished i were twenty years younger such a woman looks her best on a mans arm dont you agree mr chambers what are you doing here this time of night it was a weak ploy but the best jessica could think of let me go and put that thing away oh my dear we all know i cant do that i would like to for your sake he continued as jessica too shifted her eyes to the clock how much time do we have she wondered frantically she could be useful to you slade commented youll need a shield to get out of this i have my escape routes plotted sergeant he smiled i always leave a back door open you cant expect to get away mr chambers jessicas eyes met slades then shifted meaningfully to the clock slade must have told you that the police know everything he mentioned it keeping his arm firm he patted her shoulder you became a small weakness of mine i enjoyed those pleasant chats we had those pleasant cups of tea i felt badly that this was to be my last shipment before moving on oh yes he said to slade i was aware the authorities were getting close though i confess i miscalculated just how close and though it would seem the diamonds are temporarily lost ill find michael eventually he doesnt have them jessica said quickly then grabbed chambers arm as it cut off her breath again no the word was soft and silky even as slade anticipated moving forward chambers shot him a warning look where are they jessica swallowed straining to hear the sound of sirens why dont they come ill show you perhaps she could bargain for slades life if she could keep him alive then get chambers out of the shop even for a little while oh no that wont do he tightened his grip again tell me no jessica managed to whisper the word ill take you without speaking chambers took the gun from her temple and aimed it at slade no dont i have them at home she said frantically i have them in the wall safe in the parlor dont hurt him please ill give you the combination thirtyfive to the right twelve to the left five right and left to twentythree theyre all there i wouldnt let michael take them honest chambers commented and trusting i am fond of you my dear so i suggest you close your eyes when it comes to your turn i promise to make it as painless as possible even as slade made his move jessica screamed in protest no using all of her weight and the adrenaline of terror she flung herself on the arm holding the gun she heard the shot echoing in her head as she stumbled then was shoved roughly aside jessica landed in a heap she felt the pain in her shoulder as it connected with the floor tasted the iron flavor of blood or fear in her mouth as she scrambled up as she pushed the hair out of her eyes she saw slades fist fly toward chambers face the portly man seemed to crumble layer by layer on his way to the floor so quickly she thought numbly it was all over so quickly one moment they were both at the edge of their lives and then it was over shed never take her life for granted again not a second of it weakly she leaned back against a highboy slade get me some rope or cord from the back room you idiot she pressed her fingers between her brows and stifled a hysterical giggle so much for romantic endings she thought as she stumbled blindly toward the storeroom blinking away the haze that covered her eyes jessica found some packing cord she stared at it a moment losing track of why she needed it will you hurry up slade shouted at her responding automatically she brought it out to him tenfifteen she thought as she passed the clock how could it only be tenfifteen could people come so close to death and escape all in ten minutes slade ripped the cord out of her hand without looking up damn it jess of all the stupid things to do what the hell do you mean by bursting in here like that you know you werent to leave the house binding the unconscious chambers slade let out a steady stream of curses michael told me ten oclock she murmured and i thought if youd had a thought in your head you would have stayed put like you were told what did you think you could do racing out here like this damn it i had him before you came barrelling through the door thats not even enough for you he secured the knot then pushed passed her on the way to the phone then you throw yourself on the gun he wrenched off the receiver and started to dial you couldve been shot yes in dumb fascination jessica stared down at the stain spreading on the arm of her sweater i think i was what annoyed he turned back to her then dropped the phone out of suddenly nerveless hands oh my god in two strides he was back beside her ripping the arm of the sweater off by the seam jess youre hit brows lowered in concentration she stared at the wound yes i am she said in the deliberately steady voice of a drunk i dont feel it should it hurt theres a lot of blood shut up damn it just shut up he examined the wound quickly seeing that the bullet had gone cleanly through the flesh jesss flesh he thought his stomach rolled he stripped off his shirt and tore it into a tourniquet stupid fool youre lucky it wasnt your head his hands trembled causing him to fumble with the knot and curse her more violently it was a little gun she managed he shot her a look ripe with conflicting emotions but her vision was blurred a bullets a bullet he muttered feeling the warmth of her blood on his hands he swallowed a line of sweat ran down his naked back damn it jess what were you trying to do jumping out that way i knew what i was doing terribly sorry her head lolled a bit as she tilted it back and tried to focus on him how rude of me to intercept a bullet with your name on it dont get cute now he said between his teeth if you werent bleeding i swear id deck you he wanted to hold her and was terrified shed dissolve in his arms his throat was dry from the rawness of his own breathing as he forced himself to treat her arm as an object not part of her when hed finished binding the wound slade held her steady with one hand you probably saw that move on one of your stupid movies is that why you threw yourself at the gun no she felt as if she were floating as he started to lead her to a chair actually sergeant it was because i thought he would kill you since im in love with you i couldnt allow that he stopped dead at her words and stared down at her when he opened his mouth to speak he found he couldnt form a sound much less a word his hand dropped away from her uninjured arm im really sorry jessica said in a thick voice but i think im going to faint the last thing she heard over the buzzing in her head was a stream of curses jessica floated toward consciousness to a blur of white she felt as though her body were drifting apart from her mind even the steady throb in her shoulder seemed separate from her the white dimmed to gray then gradually lightened again until she focused on what was a wall perplexed she stared at it with an interest dulled by medication she shifted her gaze all the walls were white she noted there were horizontal blinds at the window that showed hints of night between their slants the blinds were white too as was the bandage around the arm that didnt feel like part of her she remembered letting out a sigh she focused on a blue plastic pitcher and a clear plastic glass hospital she thought with an absent grimace she hated hospitals a face bent over her obscuring her line of vision amber eyes studied pale blue they were nice enough eyes she decided in a round smooth face with a hint of jowl she spotted the white coat and stethoscope doctor she said in a whispery voice that made her frown miss winslow how are you feeling she thought about it seriously for a moment like ive been shot he gave a pleasant chuckle as he took her pulse a sensible answer he concluded youll do how long she moistened dry lips and tried again how long have i been here just over an hour taking out a slim flashlight he aimed the beam at her right eye then her left it feels like days the medication makes you sluggish any pain just a throb it doesnt feel like my arm he smiled and patted her hand its yours slade wheres slade his brow creased then cleared the sergeant hes spent most of his time pacing the corridors like a madman he wouldnt wait in the lounge when i ordered him to hes better at giving orders jessica lifted her head off the pillow letting it fall back again when the room whirled around lie still he told her firmly youll be spending a little time with us the line appeared between her brows i dont like hospitals he only patted her hand again a pity let me see slade she demanded in the best authoritative voice she could muster her eyelids threatened to droop and she forced them open please she added i dont think you take orders any better than he does no she managed a smile i dont ill let him come in a few minutes only then he thought as he studied her eyes youll sleep for the next twentyfour hours thanks with an absent nod he murmured something to the nurse who entered slade paced up and down the hospital corridor dozens of thoughts dozens of fears raced through his mind a headache pulsed behind his right temple shed been so pale no it was just shock shed be fine shed been unconscious through the ambulance ride it was better that way she might have been in pain god where was the doctor if anything happened to her his stomach convulsed again swallowing slade forced the muscles to relax turned fear to anger the headache spread to the back of his neck if they didnt let him see her soon he was going to sergeant whirling slade caught the doctor by the lapel of his coat jess how is she i want to see her now can i take her home well versed in dealing with frantic spouses parents and lovers the doctor spoke calmly without bothering to struggle out of the hold shes awake he said simply why dont we sit down slades fingers tightened why because ive been on my feet since eight oclock this morning with a sigh he decided it was best to treat this one standing up miss winslow is as well as can be expected what the hell does that mean exactly what it says the doctor returned evenly you did a good job of emergency first aid as to your second question you can see her in a moment and no you cant take her home does she have any family slade felt the color drain from his face family what do you mean family the wound wasnt that bad the bullet went clean through i had her here inside a half hour you did very well the doctor told him i simply want to keep her here for a few days under observation i need to know who to notify observation terrifying visions ran through his mind whats wrong with her to put it simply exhaustion and shock would you like more complicated medical terms shaking his head slade released him and turned away no he rubbed his hands over his face thats all it is then shes going to be all right with rest and care now her family there isnt anyone for lack of something to do with his hands slade stuck them in his pockets a sensation of utter helplessness covered him sapping the strength that tension and anger had given him ill take the responsibility i know this is a police matter sergeant but what exactly is your relationship to miss winslow slade gave a short laugh baby sitter he muttered ill take the responsibility he repeated with more force call commissioner dodson nypd hell verify it turning back he fixed the doctor with a steady look i want to see her now jessica was watching the door when slade opened it her lips curved i knew youd find a way to get past the guards can you bust me out of this place keeping his hands in his pockets he crossed to her she was as white as the sheets she lay on only her eyes gave a hint of color he thought of the first day he had seen her vibrant rushing a feeling of total inadequacy swept over him so that the hands in his pockets balled into fists how do you feel i told the doctor i felt like id been shot gingerly she touched the bandaged arm actually i feel like ive drunk a half dozen martinis and fallen off a cliff she sighed closing her eyes briefly youre not going to get me out of here are you no i didnt think so resigned she opened her eyes again to stare at the blue plastic pitcher slade i lied about the diamonds i tossed them under the seat in my car its in the middle of the road on the way to the shop i forgot to get gas she looked at him then its not even locked and jessica moistened her lips when he remained silent i gave michael money to get away thats accessory after the fact or something isnt it i suppose im in trouble ill take care of it even through her drugged haze she felt surprise arent you going to shout at me no fighting to keep her eyes open jessica laughed ill have to get shot more often she held out a hand not noticing his hesitation to take it david wasnt involved michael told me everything david had no idea what was going on i know it seems i was half right she murmured jess her hand felt so fragile im sorry what for jessica found that it took much too much effort to keep her eyes open the world was soft and gray when she closed them she thought she felt his fingers lace with hers but couldnt be sure you didnt do anything no slade looked down at her hand it was limp now he had only to release it for it to fall back on the bed thats what im sorry for its all over now isnt it slade her breathing was deep and even before he answered its all over now jess bending he pressed his lips to hers then walked away chapter contents prev next slade banked down the uncomfortable sensation of deja vu as he waited in the commissioners outer office his scowl was a bit more pronounced than it had been the first time he had sat there three weeks had passed since he had left jessicas bedside hed gone directly back to her home on leaving the hospital there hed had to deal with a puzzled then furious then frantic david shot what do you mean shot slade could still visualize the pale strained look on davids face still hear the trembling angry words if youre a cop why didnt you protect her hed had no answer for that slade had gone up to pack even as david had dialed the number of the hospital then hed driven home taking the miles to new york in a numbed weariness slade had told himself to cross jessica off as he crossed off what he considered the final assignment in his police career shed get the care and the rest she needed when she was ready to go home the nightmare would be behind her and so he told himself would he then fatigue the bonedeep exhaustion that comes after a long intense period of tension did the rest for him he collapsed into bed and slept around the clock but she had been the first thing in his mind when he woke hed called the hospital daily telling himself he was just tying up loose ends the reports were always the same resting comfortably there were days when slade had to fight the urge to get into his car and go back to her then she was released he told himself that was the end of it slade had plunged into an orgy of work the novel was finished in a marathon sixteenhour stint while he kept his door locked and his phone off the hook with his resignation turned in there were only a few necessary visits to the station house more loose ends he signed his contract and mailed his agent a copy of his second novel the reports and debriefings on the smuggling case brought jessica back too vividly slade filled out his papers and answered questions with a brevity that bordered on curtness he took the professional praise for his work in stony silence he wanted it over completed he reminded himself that his life was his own for the first time in thirtythree years but she wouldnt leave him alone she was there at night when he lay awake and restless she was there in the afternoon when he poured his concentration into the outline of his next novel she was there always there whether he walked the streets alone or surrounded himself with people he could see her on the beach laughing the wind grabbing at her hair as she tossed driftwood for the dog to chase he could see her in the kitchen of the shop slicing sandwiches while the sun dappled over her skin though he tried to block it out he could hear the way she murmured his name when she lay in his arms soft and warm and eager then he would see her white and unconscious and her blood was on his hands the guilt would overwhelm him until he threw himself into work again using the characters he developed to dilute her memory but they all seemed to have pieces of her a gesture a phrase an expression how could he escape someone who seemed to know where he would run how fast and how far now sitting again in dodsons outer office slade told himself this would be the end of it hed known all along that dodson would want a personal meeting once it was done all ties would be severed sergeant he glanced up at the secretary oblivious this time to the slow inviting smile she sent him without a word he rose to follow her into dodsons office slade dodson leaned back in his chair as slade entered then gave his secretary a brief nod no calls he ordered have a seat silently slade obeyed while the commissioner sucked pleasurably on a cigar until the tip glowed smoke wafted to the ceiling in a spiraling column which dodson watched with apparent fascination so congratulations are in order when slade gave him nothing but the same silent stare dodson continued on your book he said absently he fingered his small scrolled tie pin were sorry to lose you saying nothing slade waited for the pleasantries to be over in any event dodson leaned forward to tap his cigar ash your last case is wrapped up by all accounts tightly i dont doubt well get a conviction youre aware that michael adams had made a full confession he sent slade an arch look and got no reply the domino theory seems to be working very well in this case one name leads to another as far as chambers himself goes weve got enough on him to put him away conspiracy to commit murder accessory to murder attempted murder perhaps murder one on that business in paris not to mention the robberies and smuggling no dodson regarded the tip of his cigar with interest i dont think we need worry about him for quite some time he waited for a full thirty seconds then went on as if he were engaged in a twoway conversation youll give your evidence naturally when the time comes but it shouldnt interfere too much with your new career stubborn young fool he thought as he puffed on his cigar he decided to test the younger mans iron control by saying a name jessica told me she gave michael several thousand dollars to aid in his escape watching for a reaction he caught the faintest flicker in slades eyes here then gone it was all he needed to confirm the notion that had seeded in his mind when he had seen his goddaughter she felt that made her an accessory strange michael never mentioned her giving him any money and i spoke with him myself theres a rumor that you saw him too right after he was brought in dodson let the sentence trail off suggestively when slade didnt rise to the bait dodson went on undaunted hed cracked a few tough eggs in his own career on the street and behind a desk i imagine a few choice words were sufficient to keep michael quiet and of course jessica can afford to lose a few thousand we might have a bit of trouble keeping her quiet though he smiled that conscience of hers you know how is she the words were out before slade could stop them though he swore under his breath dodson gave no sign of hearing shes looking very well he swiveled gently in his chair ill tell you slade i was shaken when i visited her in the hospital ive never known jessica to be ill in her life and well it was quite a shock slade pulled out a cigarette lighting a match with sharp controlled violence shes bounced back the commissioner continued pleased with the reaction drove the doctor crazy until hed let her out then she went right back to work that shop of hers he gave slade a quick grin i dont suppose the notoriety will do her business any harm noting the tension in the set of slades shoulders dodson paused long enough to tap out his cigar she speaks very highly of you really slade expelled a long stream of smoke my assignment was to keep her safe i did a remarkably poor job of it she is safe dodson corrected and as stubborn as ever david and i both tried to persuade her to go to europe take a little time off to get her bearings she wont hear of it he settled back in his chair as a faint smile flickered on his lips says shes going to stay put slades eyes flew from the view out the window to pin dodsons emotions smoldered in them fiercely quickly then were suppressed hard to believe he managed she never did before so she tells me dodson steeped his fingers shes given me a full report with a great many details you omitted from yours apparently dodson commented as slade narrowed his eyes you had your hands full full enough slade returned dodson pursed his lips in speculation or agreement slade couldnt tell jessica seems to think she handled the entire business badly she handled it too well slade disagreed in a mutter if shed fallen apart i could have gotten her out yes well differing points of view of course dodsons gaze fell on the tripleframed photos of his wife and children hed had a few differing points of view with that lady from time to time he remembered the look in jessicas eyes when shed asked for slade of course now that its over he ventured im not entirely sure she wont fall apart delayed reaction slade smothered the instant urge to protect and prevent shell get through the aftermath all right therere enough people in that house to take care of her dodson laughed thats usually the other way around half the time jessica serves her staff of course betsy will cluck around her for a time until jessicas ready to scream and of course jessica wont betsys been with her for twenty years then theres the cook shes been there nearly as long makes great biscuits he paused reminiscently i guess it was about three years ago that jessica picked up all her medical bills when she had a stroke i suppose you saw old joe the gardener slade grunted crushing out his cigarette he must be ninety years old ninetytwo if memory serves me she doesnt have the heart to let him go so she hires a young boy during the summer to do the heavy work the little maid carol is the daughter of her fathers chauffeur jessica took her on when the girls father died thats jessica he sighed gustily loyal her loyaltys one of her most endearing traits and one of her most frustrating now dodson concluded was the time to drop the bomb shes hired a lawyer for michael this time the reaction was fast and furious she did what while he lifted his hands palms up in a gesture of helplessness dodson struggled with a smile she tells me she feels its her responsibility just how does she come by that slade demanded his control deserted him so that he sprang up and paced the office if he hadnt been working for her he wouldnt have gotten tangled up in this mess dodson shrugged you know how her mind works as well as i do yeah when it works at all adams is the one who got her involved hes responsible for everything that happened to her she was nearly killed twice because he didnt have the spine to protect her yes dodson agreed quietly hes responsible the emphasis on the pronoun was slight but full of meaning slade turned back at that dodson met his eyes with a look that was too understanding and too knowledgeable he thought slade looked like his father for a moment impulsive emotional hotheaded but tom dodson mused would never have been able to struggle with such turbulent feelings and win slade turned away from him again if she wants to hire a lawyer for him he murmured thats her business its got nothing to do with me no look commissioner on a spurt of fury slade whirled around i took the assignment i finished the assignment ive written my report and been debriefed ive also turned in my resignation im finished lets see how long you can convince yourself of that dodson mused smiling he extended his hand yes as i said were sorry to lose you the air smelled of snow when slade climbed out of his car he glanced up at the sky no moon no stars there was a keen night wind that made low howling noises through the naked trees he shifted his gaze to the house lights glowed here and there in the parlor in jessicas bedroom even as he watched the upstairs light winked out maybe shes gone to bed he thought hunching his shoulders against the cold i should go i shouldnt even be here even as he told himself so he walked up the steps to the front door he told himself he should turn around get back in the car and drive away he cursed whatever demon had prompted him to make the trip in the first place he lifted his hand to knock before slades fist connected with the wood the door flew open he heard jessicas breezy laugh felt the quick brush of fur against his legs then caught her as she raced out after ulysses and collided with his chest everything everything he had tried to forget came back to him in that one instant the feel of her the scent the taste of her skin under his lips then jessica tilted back her head and looked him fully in the face her eyes were bright and alive her skin flushed with laughter as he stood tense her lips curved for him in a smile that made his legs weak hello slade im sorry we almost knocked you flat her words were truer than she knew he thought quickly he released her and took a step back youre going out just for a run with ulysses jessica looked beyond his shoulder and hes gone now looking back at slade jessica offered her hand its good to see you come in and have a drink warily slade stepped inside but evaded the offered hand she turned away to fling her jacket over the newel post shutting her eyes tightly a moment when her back was to him lets go in the parlor she said brightly when she faced him again theres a nice fire in there without waiting for his answer jessica dashed away she was moving slade observed at her usual speed and the shadows were gone from under her eyes gone as if they had never existed she was as she had been in the beginning a woman with boundless energy he followed her more slowly into the parlor she was already pouring scotch into a glass im so glad you came the house is too quiet jessica picked up a decanter of vermouth with no idea what was inside as she poured she continued to talk it was wonderful for a few days but now i almost regret that i sent everyone away of course i had to lie to get them out of here youre talking too fast too fast she told herself but couldnt stop i told david and the staff i was going to jamaica to lie in the sun for a week then i bought them all airline tickets and shoved them out of the house you shouldnt be alone he was frowning at her when she handed him his drink why not with a laugh jessica tossed back her hair i couldnt stand being treated like an invalid i got enough of that in the hospital sipping her drink she turned to the fire she wouldnt let him see the hurt every day that shed been confined in that sterile white room she had waited for his call watched the door for his visit nothing hed cut himself out of her life when shed been too weak to prevent it slade stared at her slim straight back and wondered how he could leave without touching her how are you the question was curt and brief jessicas fingers tightened on her glass do you care she wondered she sipped the vermouth making the words slip back down her throat turning she smiled at him how do i look he stared at her until the need was a hard ball in his stomach you need to gain some weight she laughed shortly thank you very much needing to do something jessica wandered over to toy with the keys of the piano did you finish your book yes then everythings going well for you everythings going just dandy he drank willing the liquor to dull the ache your mother liked the figure confused he drew his brows together oh yeah yeah she liked it they lapsed into silence accented by the crackling wood and drifting notes there was too much to say slade thought and nothing to say again he cursed himself for not being strong enough to stay away youve gone back to work he asked yes weve had a stream of customers since the publicity i suppose itll taper off have you resigned from the force yes silence fell again more thickly jessica stared down at the piano keys as if she were about to compose a symphony youd want to tie up loose ends wouldnt you she murmured am i a loose end slade something like that he muttered her head came up at that and her eyes fixed on his once searingly turning away she walked to the window well then she whispered with her finger she drew a maze on the glass i think ive told every proper authority every proper thing there was a steady stream of men in dark suits in my hospital room she dropped her hand to her side why didnt you come to see me or call her voice steadied as she stared at the reflection of the lamp in the window shouldnt there have been a final interview for your report or is that why you came tonight i dont know why the hell i came he tossed back then slammed down his empty glass i didnt come to see you because i didnt want to see you i didnt call because i didnt want to talk to you well that certainly clears that up he took a step toward her stopped himself then thrust his hands in his pockets hows your arm its fine absently she reached up to touch the wound that had healed while she thought of the one that hadnt the doctor says i wont even have a scar great thats just great slade pulled out a pack of cigarettes then tossed it on a table i like the idea jessica returned calmly im not fond of scars did you mean what you said it rushed out of him before he could think to prevent it about the scar no not about the damn scar frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair i try to mean what i say she murmured her heart was in her throat now so that she forced herself to say each word carefully you said you were in love with me every muscle in his body tensed did you mean it taking a deep breath jessica turned back to him her face was composed her eyes calm yes i meant it its your warped sense of gratitude he told her then paced to the fire and back again something began to warm in her jessica felt simultaneous sensations of relief and amusement i think i could tell the difference she considered sometimes im very grateful to the butcher for a good cut of meat but i havent fallen in love with him yet oh youre funny slade shot her a furious glance dont you see it was just circumstance just the situation was it jessica smiled as she crossed to him slade backed away i dont want any part of you he told her heatedly i want you to understand that i think i understand she lifted a hand to his cheek i think i understand very well he caught her wrist but couldnt force himself to toss it aside do you know how i felt having you unconscious your blood on my hands do you know what it did to me seeing you in that hospital bed ive seen corpses with more color she felt his fingers tremble lightly before they dropped her wrist damn it jess he breathed before he spun away to pour himself another drink slade jessica wrapped her arms around his waist why hadnt she thought of that she demanded of herself why hadnt she realized that he would blame himself i was the one who was in the wrong place at the wrong time dont he put his hands on hers firmly pushing them away ivegot nothing for you cant you understand nothing different poles jess we barely speak the same language if he had faced her he would have seen the line form between her brows i dont know what youre talking about look at this place he gestured around the room as he whirled to her where you live how you live its got nothing to do with me oh pursing her lips she considered i see youre a snob damn you cant you see anything infuriated he grabbed her shoulders i dont want you try again she suggested he opened his mouth then relieved his frustration by shaking her youve no right no right to get inside my head this way i want you out once and for all i want you out slade she said quietly why dont you stop hating it so much and give in im not going anywhere how his hands found their way into her hair he didnt know but they were sunk deep and so was he struggling all the way he gave in i love you damn it id like to choke you for it his eyes grew dark and stormy you worked on me he accused as she gazed up at him calm and composed right from the beginning you worked on me until i cant function without you for gods sake i could smell you down at the station house pushed as much by fury as by need he dragged her into his arms i thought id go mad unless i could taste you again his lips covered hers not gently but then jessica wasnt looking for gentleness here was the hard bruising contact she had longed to feel again her response came in an explosion of heart body and mind so that her demand met his and fulminated they clung for one long shimmering instant then they were tangled together on the hearth rug i need you the words shuddered from him as two pairs of hands struggled with clothes now he found her naked breast and groaned its been so long too long words were no longer possible beside them the fire sizzled new flames licking at wood wind rattled at the windows they heard nothing felt nothing but each other lips sought then devoured hands explored then possessed there was no time for a slow reacquaintance hungry they came together swiftly letting sharp pleasure cleanse all doubts they remained close body to body and mouth to mouth until need drifted to contentment jessica held him against her when he would have shifted to her side no dont move she murmured im crushing you only a little slade lifted his head to grin at her and found himself lost in the cloudy amber of her eyes slowly he traced the slanted line of her cheekbone i love you jess still angry about it she asked before he buried his face at her throat she caught the grin resigned on a small gasp she punched his shoulder resigned huh thats very flattering well let me tell you i didnt picture myself falling in love with a badtempered excop who tries to order me around that musky woodsy fragrance of her skin distracted him he began to nuzzle at her neck wallowing in it who did you picture yourself falling in love with a cross between albert schweitzer and clark gable she told him slade gave a snort before raising his head again yeah well you came close are you going to marry me jessica lifted a brow do i have a choice bending he nibbled on her lips arent you the one who says a person always has a choice mmm so i am she pulled him closer for one long satisfying kiss i suppose we both have one to make dont we their eyes met then they spoke together you endings and beginnings chapter contents prev next a white house source has confirmed the imminent retirement of secretary of state george larkin secretary larkin underwent extensive cardiac surgery last week and is currently recovering at bethesda naval hospital his health is given as the reason for his midterm retirement stan richardson has an onthescene report from bethesda naval liv watched the monitor switch to the location shot before she turned to her coanchor brian this could be the biggest thing to hit since the malloy scandal last october there must be five viable replacements for larkin the scramblings going to start brian jones flipped through his notes running over his timing he was a thirtyfiveyearold black with a flare for clothes and ten years of television news experience though he had grown up in queens he considered himself a washingtonian nothing you love better than a good scramble nothing liv agreed and turned back to the camera as control gave her her cue the president had no comment today on secretary larkins replacement speculation from a high official lists beaumont dell former ambassador to france and general robert j fitzhugh as top candidates neither could be reached for comment a twentyfiveyearold man was found slain in his apartment in northeast washington this afternoon brian took over his first segment of their anchor partnership liv listened with half an ear while her mind raced with possibilities beaumont dell was her choice his aides had given her the classic runaround that afternoon but she was determined to be parked on his doorstep the next morning as a reporter she was accustomed to runarounds waiting and having doors shut in her face nothing absolutely nothing she told herself was going to stop her from interviewing dell hearing her next cue liv turned to camera three and began her leadin in their homes viewers saw the head and shoulders of an elegant brunette her voice was lowkey her pace unhurried they would have no idea how carefully the minute and fifteen seconds had been timed and edited they saw sincerity and beauty in the television news game one was often as important as the other livs hair was short and sculptured around a finely boned face her eyes were cool blue serious and direct a viewer could easily believe she spoke especially for him her television audience found her classy a little remote and accurate liv was satisfied with the consensus on her role as coanchor of the local evening news as a reporter she wanted more much more a colleague had once described her as having that wealthy connecticut look indeed she had come from a welloff new england family and her degree in journalism was from harvard however she had worked her way up through the ranks of television reporting she had started at base pay at a tiny independent station in new jersey reading weather and doing quick consumer spots she had played the usual game of hopscotching from station to station city to city a little more money a little more air time she had landed a position at a cnc affiliate in austin working her way up in her twoyear stay to an anchoring position when she had been offered the coanchor spot at wwbw the cnc affiliate in washington dc liv had jumped at it there were no firm ties in austin nor for years anywhere else she had wanted to make her name in television journalism washington she felt was a perfect place to do it she didnt mind dirty work though her smooth narrow hands looked as if they were accustomed to only the silks and satins of life she had a seeking eager shrewd brain under the ivory skin and patrician features she thrived on the fast close to impossible pace of visual news while on the surface she was cool remote and seemingly untouchable for the past five years liv had been working hard to convince herself that the image was fact at twentyeight she told herself she was through with personal upheavals the only roller coaster she wanted to ride on was a professional one what friends she had made during her sixteen months in dc were allowed only a glimpse of her past liv kept a lock on her private life this is olivia carmichael she told the camera and brian jones stay tuned for cnc world news the quick throb of theme music took over then the red light on the camera facing her blinked out liv undipped her mike and pushed away from the semicircular desk used by the news team tight show the man behind camera one commented as she started past overhead the hot bright lights shut down liv shifted her thoughts and focused on him she smiled the smile transformed her cool polished beauty she only used that particular smile when she meant it thanks ed hows your girl cramming for exams he shrugged and pulled off his headset doesnt have much time for me youll be proud of her when she gets that degree in education yeah ah liv he stopped her again and she lifted a brow in acknowledgment she wanted me to ask you he looked uncomfortable as he hesitated what who does your hair he blurted out then shook his head and fiddled with his camera women laughing liv patted his arm armonds on wisconsin tell her to use my name she moved briskly from the studio up the steps and through the winding corridors that led to the newsroom it was noisy with the transition from day to evening shift reporters sat on the corners of desks drank coffee or typed furiously to meet the deadline for the eleven oclock broadcast there was a scent of tobacco light sweat and old coffee in the air one wall was lined with television screens which gave the action but not the sound of every station in the metropolitan area already on screen one was the intro for cnc world news liv headed straight through the confusion to the glasswalled office of the news director carl she stuck her head in his door do you have a minute carl pearson was slouched over his desk hands folded as he stared at a tv screen the glasses he should have been wearing were under a pile of papers her had a cup of cold coffee balanced on a stack of files and a cigarette burned down between his fingers he grunted liv entered knowing the grunt was affirmative good show tonight his eyes never left the twelveinch screen liv took a seat and waited for the commercial break she could hear the crisp hardline tones of harris mcdowell new york anchor for cnc world news coming from the set at her side it was fruitless to talk to carl when the big guns were out harris mcdowell was a big gun she knew he and carl had worked together in their early days as reporters at the same station in kansas city missouri but it had been harris mcdowell who had been assigned to cover a presidential cavalcade in dallas in the assassination of a president and his onthescene reports had rocketed mcdowell from relative obscurity to national prominence carl pearson had remained a big fish in a sea of little fishes in missouri and a handful of other states until he had hung up his notebook in exchange for a desk in washington he was a tough news director exacting excitable if he was bitter about the different path his career had taken he was careful not to show it liv respected him and had grown steadily fonder of him during her stint at wwbw shed had her own share of disappointments what it was carls way of telling her to speak her piece once the break had come i want to follow up on beaumont dell liv began ive done a lot of legwork on this already and when hes appointed secretary of state i want to put it on the air first carl sat back and folded his hands over his paunch he blamed too much sitting at a desk for the extra fifteen pounds he carried around the look he aimed at liv was as direct and uncompromising as the look he had aimed at the television screen a little ahead of the game his voice was roughened by years of chainsmoking as she watched he lit another though a cigarette still smoldered in his overfilled ashtray what about fitzhugh and davis and albertson they might question your appointment of dell officially larkin hasnt resigned its a matter of days probably hours you heard the doctors statement the acting secretary wont be appointed permanently boswells not the presidents favorite boy its going to be dell i know it carl sniffed and rubbed a hand over his nose he liked carmichaels instincts she was sharp and savvy despite the borntothemanor looks and she was thorough but he was understaffed and the budget was tight he couldnt afford to send one of his top reporters out on a hunch when he could assign someone he could spare more still he hesitated a moment then leaned over the desk again might be worth it he mumbled lets hear what thorpe has to say his reports coming up liv shifted in her chair in automatic protest then subsided it was pride that had her ready to object to having her assignment hinge on the words of tc thorpe but pride didnt cut weight with carl instead she rose to sit on the corner of his desk and watch the washington anchor was broadcasting from the studio above her head it was a much more stylized set than the one she had just left but that was the difference between the local and national news and the local and national news budgets after his brief leadin the screen switched to the location shot and tc thorpes standup with a frown liv watched him though it was no more than thirty degrees with a wicked windchill factor he wore his coat unbuttoned and had no hat it was typical he had a rugged weathertanned face liv associated with a mountain climber and the streamlined body of a longdistance runner both professions required endurance so did reporting tc thorpe was all reporter his eyes were dark and intense locking on the viewers and holding them his dark hair blew furiously around his face giving his report an air of urgency yet his voice was clean and unhurried the contrast worked for him more successfully than flash or gimmicks worked for others liv knew his visual appeal was tremendous he had the athletic justshortofhandsome looks that appealed to both men and women his eyes were intelligent and instilled trust as did the deep wellpitched voice he was accessible she knew reporters were put into slots remote mystical omnipotent accessible thorpe was flesh and blood and viewers could welcome him into their living rooms comfortably and accept his word and there was the feeling that if the world began to collapse tc thorpe would report it without missing a beat in his five years as senior washington correspondent he had built an enviable reputation he had the two things most essential to a reporter credibility and sources if tc thorpe said it it was believed if tc thorpe needed information he knew which numbers to call livs resentment against him was instinctive she specialized in the political beat for the local broadcast thorpe was her nemesis he guarded his turf with the ferocity of a dog in a junkyard he was rooted in washington she was still the new kid on the block and he wasnt giving her any room it seemed inevitable that when she had a hot lead he had been there first liv had spent months looking for a viable criticism of him it wasnt accurate to call him flashy thorpe dressed down on the job wearing nothing to distract the viewers attention from his reporting his style was straightforward his reports had depth and bite while he remained objective there was no fault to find in the way he worked all liv could criticize him for was arrogance she watched him now as he stood with the white house lit in the background he was recapping the larkin story it was obvious he had spoken to larkin personally something she had been unable to do though she had pulled all the strings available to her that alone grated thorpe too listed prospective candidates for the position he named dell first carl nodded behind her back as liv scowled at the screen he felt it put a bit more power into her hunch this is tc thorpe at the white house tell the desk you have an assignment carl announced and drew hard on the butt of his cigarette liv turned to him but his eyes were still on the screen take crew two fine she swallowed the annoyance that it was thorpes influence more than her own that had gained her what she wanted ill make the arrangements bring me something for the noon news he called after her and squinted to focus on the next segment liv looked over her shoulder as she opened the door youll have it it was eight am and freezing when liv and her twoman crew arrived at the iron gates of beaumont dells home in alexandria virginia liv had been up since five preparing her questions after half a dozen phone calls the evening before she had elicited a promise from one of dells aides that she would be granted a tenminute interview that morning a good reporter could learn quite a bit in ten minutes sliding out of the crew van liv approached the guard at the gate olivia carmichael with wwbw she flashed her press pass mr dell is expecting me the guard examined livs credentials then his clip board before nodding without a word he pressed the button to open the gates friendly sort she decided as she climbed back into the van okay be ready to set up fast were not going to have much time she was reaching in her purse to take out her notes for a final check as the van wound up the drive bob id like a pan of the house and one of the gates when we leave already got one of the gates he gave her a grin as she smiled back at him and of your legs youve got some great legs liv think so she crossed them and gave them a critical stare youre probably right she enjoyed his goodnatured flirting bob was harmless happily married with two growing children a serious flirtation would have frozen her she separated men into two categories safe and dangerous bob was safe she could relax with him all right she said as the van stopped in front of the threestory brick house try to look like respectable members of the working press grinning bob muttered a short expletive and climbed out of the back of the van at the front door liv was once again the cool aloof newswoman no one would dare to comment on her legs not out loud she knocked briskly leaving the crew to follow with their equipment olivia carmichael she announced to the maid who opened the door to see mr dell yes the maid glanced past her with the slightest moue of disapproval at the bluejeaned crew hauling equipment up the front steps this way ms carmichael mr dell will be right with you liv recognized the maids disapproval she thought little of it her own family and many of her childhood friends felt the same way about her profession the hall was an elegant refined entrance to a wealthy home liv had seen the same hall in a dozen homes in a dozen styles when she was growing up there had been hundreds of teas stiff little parties and carefully organized outings all of which had bored her to distraction she never cast a glance at the matisse on the wall on her left she heard bobs low whistle as he entered behind her some place he commented as his sneakers moved soundlessly over the parquet floor liv made a distracted sound of agreement as she went back over her strategy she had grown up in a home not so very much different from this one her mother had preferred chippendale to louis xiv but it was all the same even the scent was the same lemon oil and fresh flowers it stirred old memories before liv had taken two steps behind the maid she heard the sound of male laughter ill swear tc you know how to tell a story ill have to make sure the first ladys not around when i repeat that one dell came lightly down the stairs trim handsomely sixtyish and beside thorpe liv felt her stomach muscles tighten always one step ahead of me she thought on a swift rush of fury damn briefly potently she met thorpes eyes he smiled but it wasnt the same smile he had given to dell as they had begun their descent ah ms carmichael spotting her dell extended his hand as he crossed the hall his voice was as smooth as his palm his eyes were shrewd very prompt i hope i havent kept you waiting no mr dell i appreciate the time liv let her eyes pass over thorpe mr thorpe ms carmichael i know youre a busy man ambassador liv turned her eyes back to him with a smile i wont take much of your time an unobtrusive move put the mike in her hand would you be comfortable talking to me here she asked to give the soundman a voice level fine he made an expansive gesture and gave a generous smile the smile was the stockintrade of the diplomat from the corner of her eye liv watched thorpe move out of camera range to stand by the door the eyes she felt on the back of her neck made her uncomfortable turning to dell she started her interview he continued to be expansive cooperative genial liv felt like a dentist trying to pull a tooth from a patient who smiled with his mouth firmly shut of course he was aware that his name was being linked with the position to be vacated by larkin naturally he was flattered to be considered by the press liv noted he was careful not to mention the presidents name she was being led in circles gently expertly just as gently she backtracked and probed from different angles she was getting the tone she wanted if not the firm words mr dell has the president spoken to you directly about the appointment of a new secretary of state she knew better than to expect a yes or no answer the president and i havent met to discuss an appointment but you have met with him she persisted i have occasion to meet with the president from time to time at his subtle signal the maid appeared at his elbow with his coat and hat im sorry i cant give you more time ms carmichael he was shrugging into his coat liv knew she was losing him she moved with him to the door are you seeing the president this morning mr dell it was a blunt question but it wasnt the verbal answer liv looked for as much as the reaction in the eyes of the man she asked she saw it the faint flicker the briefest hesitation possibly dell extended his hand a pleasure talking to you ms carmichael im afraid i have to run traffic is so heavy at this time of the morning liv lifted a hand to signal bob to stop the tape thank you for seeing me mr dell after passing the mike to the soundman liv followed dell and thorpe outside always a pleasure he patted her hand and smiled with his oldworld southern charm now you be sure to call anna tc he turned to thorpe and gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder she wants to hear from you ill do that dell walked down the steps to the discreet black limo where his driver waited not bad carmichael thorpe commented as the limo pulled away you do a tough interview of course he looked down at her and smiled dells been dancing his way around tough interviews for years liv gave him a cool stare what were you doing here having breakfast he answered easily im an old family friend she would have liked to knock the smile from his face with a good swift punch instead she meticulously pulled on her gloves dells going to get that appointment thorpe lifted a brow is that a statement olivia or a question i wouldnt ask you for the time of day thorpe she retorted and you wouldnt give it to me if i did ive always said you were a sharp lady good god shes beautiful he thought when he saw her on the air it was easy to attribute the nearly impossible beauty to lighting makeup camera angles but standing face to face in harsh morning light she was quite simply the most physically beautiful woman he had ever seen the incredible bone structure the flawless skin only her eyes were hot giving away the fury she was controlling thorpe smiled again he loved to watch the ice crack is that the problem thorpe liv demanded as she stepped aside to let the crew pass dont you like reporters who happen to be women he laughed and shook his head you know better than that liv reporter is a word without sex his eyes werent intense now but filled with good humor she didnt like them any better more accurately she refused to like them any better why wont you cooperate with me the wind was tossing his hair around his face as it had the night before thorpe seemed untouched by the cold as liv shivered inside her coat we have the same job we work for the same people my turf he said quietly if you want a share liv youre going to have to fight for it it took me years to establish myself here dont expect to do the same in months he saw her shudder against the cold as she continued to glare at him youd better get inside the van im going to have my share thorpe it was half threat half warning youre going to have a hell of a fight on your hands thorpe inclined his head in acknowledgment ill count on it it was obvious to him that liv wasnt leaving until he did she would stand there shivering for an hour out of sheer stubbornness without a word thorpe walked down the steps to his car liv stood for another moment after hed driven off she was aware and annoyed by the fact that she was able to breathe with more ease when he was no longer standing beside her he had a strong personality it was impossible to be indifferent to him he demanded definite emotions liv decided hers were all unflattering he wasnt going to block her way she wasnt going to put up with it she walked down the steps to the van slowly anna she thought suddenly remembering the name dell had mentioned to thorpe anna dell monroe dells daughter and official hostess since the death of her mother anna dell monroe whatever was going on in her fathers life shed know about it moving quickly now liv climbed in the van well drop the tape at the station for editing then we head for georgetown chapter contents prev next liv typed furiously she had given carl the dell interview for the noon news but she had more a great deal more for the evening show her hunch about anna monroe had paid off anna knew the details of her fathers life though she had been careful during the interview she wasnt the trained diplomat her father was liv had enough from her halfhour interview in the parlor of anna monroes georgetown row house to give her viewers a story with touches of glamour and suspense the tape was good she had already taken a quick look at it while it was still being edited bob had captured the stylish elegance of the room and the gentle privileged breeding of the woman it would be a good contrast to the compact shrewdness of her father annas respect for her father came through as well as her taste for the finer things liv had worked both into the interview it was a solid piece of reporting and it gave a glimpse of the largerthanlife world of affluent people in politics liv transcribed her notes hurriedly liv we need you for the voiceover on the tease she glanced up long enough to search for brian the look she gave him made him sigh he pushed away from his desk and stretched his shoulders all right all right ill do it but you owe me one youre a prince brian she went back to her typing ten minutes later liv pulled the last sheet from her typewriter carl she called to the director as he crossed the newsroom toward his office copy for the lead story bring it in as she rose liv checked the clock she had an hour before air time the television was on its volume low when she entered carls office seated behind his desk he checked copy and time allowances did you see the tape yet liv handed him her pages its good he lit a cigarette from the butt of another and gave a quick hacking cough well run part of this mornings business with dell then lead into the interview with the daughter he read livs copy with a small furrow of concentration between his brows it was a good tidy story giving quick bios on all top contenders for the cabinet post and focusing in on beaumont dell it gave the audience a full open view before it brought them to dells doorstep liv watched smoke curl toward the ceiling and waited i want to flash pictures of the rest of them while you read the bios he scribbled notes on her script we should have them on file if not well get them from upstairs upstairs was the term for cncs washington bureau looks like youre going to have about three minutes to fill i want three and a half she waited until carl looked up at her we dont replace many secretaries of state midterm carl our next biggest story is the possibility of a partial shutdown of the potomac river filtration system this is worth three and a half go argue with the time editor he suggested then held up his hand as she began to speak liv saw immediately what had shifted his attention the graphics for a special bulletin flashed across the screen she obeyed his quick hand signal to turn up the volume even as she did tc thorpe stared directly into her eyes liv hadnt been prepared for the intensity of the look she felt a sexual pull a quick unexpected flash of desire it left her stunned she leaned back against carls desk she hadnt felt anything like that in more than five years staring at the television image she missed the first few words of thorpes report has accepted secretary of state larkins resignation as expected secretary larkin resigned his cabinet post for reasons of poor health he remains in bethesda naval hospital recovering from extensive cardiac surgery performed last week with the acceptance of larkins resignation the president has appointed beaumont dell to fill the vacated post dell officially accepted an hour ago in a meeting in the oval office press secretary donaldson has scheduled a press conference tomorrow at nine am liv felt the supports fall out from under her and leaned back heavily she heard thorpe recap the bulletin while she closed her eyes and took a deep breath carl was already swearing her story was dead the guts had just been torn out of it and he had known it liv straightened as the scheduled program flashed back on the screen hed known it at eight oclock that morning do the rewrites carl was telling her grabbing for his phone as it rang and get somebody upstairs for thorpes copy we need it to fill in the bit with the daughter is scrubbed liv grabbed her papers from carls desk and marched to the door they need you in makeup liv she ignored the statement and continued out of the newsroom impatient she paced back and forth in front of the elevator waiting for it to make the descent hes not going to get away with it she fumed hes not going to get away with this without a scratch she continued to pace back and forth inside the elevator on her way to the fourth floor it had been years she could count the years since anything or anyone had made her this angry she was bursting with the need to let out her temper and there was only one man who deserved the full force of it thorpe she demanded curtly when she entered the fourthfloor newsroom a reporter glanced up and cupped her hand over the mouthpiece of her phone in his office this time liv took the stairs she darted up them forgetting her carefully constructed poise and control ms carmichael the receptionist outside the fifthfloor offices rose as liv dashed through ms carmichael she repeated to livs retreating back whom did you want to see ms carmichael liv burst into thorpes office without a knock you louse thorpe stopped typing and turned toward the door he watched more intrigued than annoyed as the unannounced visitor crossed the room olivia he leaned back but didnt rise what a nice surprise he noted the receptionist hovering in the doorway and shook his head slightly to send her away have a seat he invited with a gesture of his hand i dont believe youve graced my office in over a year you killed my story liv her copy still in her hand remained standing and leaned over his desk he noted the high color in her normally pale face the dark fury in her normally calm eyes her hair was mussed from her mad scramble up the steps and she was breathing hard thorpe was fascinated how far he wondered could he push before she really let loose he decided to find out what story you know damn well she put her palms down on the desk and leaned over farther you did it deliberately i do most things deliberately he agreed easily if youre talking about the dell story liv he continued sweeping his eyes back to hers it wasnt your story it was mine it is mine you broke it fortyfive minutes before my broadcast her voice was raised in fury something he had never witnessed before to his knowledge olivia carmichael never spoke above her carefully modulated pitch her anger was usually ice not fire so he laced his fingers together and watched her over them youve got a complaint about my timing youve left me holding nothing she held out her copy then crumpled it and let it drop ive worked for two weeks putting this together since larkin had the heart attack you killed it in two minutes im not responsible for protecting your story carmichael you are better luck next time oh enraged liv struck both fists on the mahogany desk youre contemptible i poured hours into this story hundreds of phone calls miles of legwork its because of you that i have an obstacle course to run in the first place her eyes narrowed and he noted that a faint new england accent was slipping through do i scare you that much thorpe are you so insecure about your sanctified piece of turf and the mundane quality of your reporting insecure he was up leaning on the desk until they were nose to nose worrying about you inching onto my ground doesnt keep me up at night carmichael i dont concern myself with junior reporters who try to scramble up the ladder three rungs at a time come back when youve paid your dues liv made a low sound of fury dont talk to me about paying dues thorpe i started paying mine eight years ago eight years ago i was in lebanon dodging bullets while you were at harvard dodging football players i never dodged football players liv retorted furiously and thats totally irrelevant you knew this morning you knew what was going down and what if i did you knew id be spinning my wheels dont you feel any loyalty to the local station no his answer was so matteroffact it threw her for a moment you started there would you call wtrl in jersey and give them your exclusive because you read the weather there he countered drop the alma mater routine liv it doesnt cut it youre despicable her voice had dropped to a dangerous level all you had to do was tell me you were going to break the story and youd have politely folded your hands and let me break it first she watched the ironical lift of his brow youd have slit my throat to put that story on the air gladly he laughed then youre honest when youre mad liv and gorgeous he took some papers from his desk and held them out to her youll need my notes to revise your lead youve less than thirty minutes until air i know what time it is she ignored the outstretched papers she had an almost irresistible urge to hurl something through the plate glass window at his back were going to settle this thorpe if not now soon im tired of having to crawl over your back for every one of my stories she snatched the notes hating to accept anything from him but knowing she was boxed in fine he watched her retrieve her own crumpled copy meet me for drinks tonight not on your life she turned and headed for the door afraid the one softly taunting word stopped her liv turned and glared at him orileys eight oclock youre on thorpe grinned as she slammed the door behind her so he thought when he settled back in his chair there is flesh and blood under the silk hed begun to have his doubts it appears ive made my first move he laughed a little as he swiveled to stare out at his view of the city damn but shed made him mad all for the best he decided otherwise hed still be biding his time one of the most important qualities a reporter had to have was patience thorpe had been patient for more than a year sixteen months he thought to be exact since the first night hed watched her broadcast he remembered the low calm voice the cool clean beauty his attraction had been immediate and absolute the moment he had met her felt that aloof gaze on him he had wanted her instinct had told him to hold off keep a distance there was more to olivia carmichael than met the eye he could have checked her background thoroughly he had the talent the contacts yet something had curbed his reporters drive to know he had fallen back on patience having spent time cooling his heels staking out politicians thorpe knew all about patience he sat back and lit a cigarette it looked as though it were about to pay off at eight oclock liv pulled into a parking space beside orileys for an instant she rested her brow against the steering wheel all too clearly she could picture herself storming through the newsrooms and into thorpes office with perfect clarity she heard herself shouting at him she detested losing her temper detested more losing it in front of thorpe from the first time she had met him face to face liv had recognized a man she would need to keep at a distance he was too strong too charismatic he fell into the dangerous category headed it in fact she had wanted to keep an impersonal distance and formality was necessary for that a few hours before liv had dropped all formality you couldnt be formal with someone when you were pressed nose to nose and shouting im not cool and unruffled she murmured no matter how hard i try to be and she realized with a sigh thorpe knew it when she was a child she had been the misfit in a family of sedate wellmannered people she had asked too many questions cried too many tears laughed too lustily unlike her sister she hadnt been interested in party dresses and ribbons she had wanted a dog to run with not the quiet little poodle her mother had babied she had wanted a tree house not the tidy pristine playhouse her father had hired an architect to build she had wanted to race and had been constantly told to walk liv had escaped from the strict rules and expectations of being a carmichael there had been freedom in college and more liv had thought she had found everything she could ever want then she had lost it for the last six years she had been dealing with a new phase in her growth the final phase she had determined she had only herself to think about and her career she hadnt lost the thirst for freedom but she had learned caution liv straightened and shook her head this wasnt the time to think of her past her present and her future demanded her attention i wont lose my temper again she promised herself as she climbed from the car i wont give him the satisfaction she walked into orileys to meet thorpe he saw her enter hed been watching for her shes slipped the veil back on he noted her face was composed her eyes serene as they scanned the room in search of him standing in the noise and smoke she looked like marble cool and smooth and exquisite thorpe wanted to touch her feel her skin watch her eyes heat anger wasnt the only passion he wanted to bring out in her the desire he had banked down for months was beginning to crowd him how long will it take to peel away those protective layers he mused he was willing to take his time enjoy the challenge because he intended to win thorpe wasnt accustomed to losing he waited until her eyes settled on him he smiled and inclined his head but didnt rise to lead her to the table he liked the way she walked smooth fluid with undercurrents of sensuality hello olivia thorpe liv slid into the booth opposite him whatll you have wine she glanced up at the waiter who was already at her elbow white wine lou sure ms carmichael another round mr thorpe no thanks he lifted his scotch he had noted the quick smile she had given the young waiter it had warmed her face for a brief moment then her eyes were back on his and the warmth was gone all right thorpe if were going to clear the air i suggest we get to it are you always all business liv he lit a cigarette watching her face one of his greatest assets was his ability to study directly endlessly more than one highpowered politician had squirmed under his dark patient gaze she didnt like the quiet power or its effect on her we met here to discuss havent you ever heard of pleasantries he countered how are you nice weather were having i dont care how you are she returned evenly he wasnt going to get the best of her and the weathers terrible such a sweet voice such a nasty tongue he observed the flare quickly controlled which leaped into her eyes you have the most perfect face ive ever seen liv stiffened back shoulders arms thorpe noted the involuntary movement and sipped his scotch i didnt come here to discuss my looks no but then looks are part of the job arent they the waiter set the wine in front of her liv slipped her fingers around the stem but didnt lift the glass viewers would rather invite attractive people into their living rooms it makes the news easier to swallow you add a little class as well its a nice touch my looks have nothing to do with the quality of my reporting her voice was cold and unemotional but her eyes were beginning to heat no but they do score you points in broadcasting he leaned back still studying her youre a damned good broadcaster liv and youre picking up speed as a reporter she frowned at him was he trying to unbalance her by tossing out a compliment and he added without changing rhythm youre a very cautious woman what are you talking about if i asked you out to dinner what would you say no he acknowledged this with a quick unoffended grin why deliberately she took a sip of wine because i dont like you i dont have dinner with men i dont like which implies that you do have dinner with men you like thorpe took a last thoughtful drag then crushed out his cigarette but you dont go out with anyone do you thats none of your business infuriated liv started to rise but his hands came down firmly on hers you tend to jump and run when the buttons pushed im curious about you olivia he was speaking quietly below the laughter and raised voices around them i dont want you to be interested in me in any way i dont like you she repeated and controlled the urge to fight against his hold his palms were hard and unexpectedly rough it was an odd sensation on her skin i dont like your understated machismo or your overstated arrogance understated machismo he grinned enjoying himself i think thats a compliment the grin was appealing and she steeled herself against it she knew she had been right to term him dangerous i like your style liv and your face iced sex he continued then saw that he had hit a nerve a raw one her hands jumped convulsively under his her eyes went from angry to hurt to carefully blank let go of my hands he had wanted to annoy her prod her but not to hurt her im sorry the apology was simple sincere and unexpected it killed her urge to spring up and leave when his hands left hers she reached for her wine again if were finished with the pleasantries now thorpe perhaps we can get down to business all right liv he agreed your turn at bat she set down her glass i want you to stop roadblocking me be specific wwbw is an affiliate of cnc theres supposed to be a certain amount of cooperation the local broadcast is just as important as the national and at times he was maddeningly closemouthed she pushed her wine aside and leaned forward on the table im not asking for your help i dont want it but im tired of the sabotage sabotage he picked up his drink and swirled it she was becoming animated again forgetting her vow to remain distant and untouchable he liked the hint of pink under her ivorytoned skin you knew i was working on the dell story you knew every step i took dont try that innocent boyish look on me thorpe i know you have contacts in the woodwork at wbw you wanted me to make an ass of myself he laughed amused at the phrase coming from her sure i knew what you were doing he admitted with an easy shrug but thats your problem not mine i gave you my copy thats standard procedure the local always gets feed from upstairs i wouldnt have needed your copy if you hadnt held a knife to my throat she wasnt interested in standard procedure or the generosity of upstairs with the right information i could have changed the tone of my interview with anna monroe and still have used it it was a good piece of work and its wasted tunnel vision he stated simply and finished off his scotch a hazard in reporting if he continued as he lit another cigarette you had considered a few more possibilities you would have asked anna different questions led her by the nose a bit more then after id broken the story the interview could have been reedited youd still have been able to use it i saw the tape he added it was a good piece of work you just didnt press enough of the right buttons dont tell me how to do my job then dont tell me how to do mine now he too leaned forward ive had the political beat for five years im not handing you capitol hill on a platter carmichael if youve got a problem with the way i work take it up with morrison he tossed out the name of the head of cncs washington bureau youre so smug liv had a sudden desire to choke him so sure of your sanctified position as keeper of the holy grail theres nothing sanctified about the political beat in this town carmichael thorpe countered im here because i know how to play the games maybe you need a few lessons not from you you could do worse he paused a moment and calculated look for the sake of professional courtesy ill give you this much it takes more than a year to spread roots here the people in this town are insecure their jobs are always on the line politics is an ugly word uglier since watergate abscam exposing them is our job they cant ignore us so they try to use us the same way we use them youre not telling me anything i dont know maybe not he agreed but you have an advantage youre not cultivating your looks and your class i dont see what dont be an idiot he cut her off with a quick annoyed gesture a reporter has to use everything he can beg borrow or steal your face doesnt have anything to do with your brain but it does have something to do with the way people perceive you human nature he let his words sink in she was digesting what he said annoyed because she knew he was right charm worked for some reporters abrasiveness for others and class as he put it could work for her theres an embassy party saturday night ill take you her attention came full circle back to him astonished she stared youll you want to get in the door take the one thats most accessible the incredulity in her eyes amused him a lot of interesting gossip goes on in the ladies room after a few glasses of champagne youd know all about that of course liv said dryly youd be surprised she was cautious uneasy tempted why would you do this he pushed her wine glass back in front of her theres a saying about gift horses liv theres one about trojan horses too he laughed and sat back a good reporter would have opened the gates and had a scoop he was right of course but she didnt like it she knew that if it had been anyone else but thorpe she wouldnt have hesitated that gives him too much importance she told herself and gathered up her purse all right what embassy canadian it had amused him to watch her work out the decision what time should i meet you ill pick you up she had started to rise but now stopped no my party my terms take it or leave it she didnt like it to have met him would have kept the evening professional and relatively safe though she doubted that a woman was ever really safe with thorpe he was boxing her into a corner if she refused now shed look and feel like a fool all right liv reached for her notebook ill give you my address i know your address he watched her eyes fly back to his wary and suspicious thorpe smiled im a reporter liv i deal in information he slid from the booth ill walk you out taking her arm he led her to the door liv kept silent she wasnt certain if she had won a point or taken two steps backward in any case she thought it better than standing still you dont have to come out she began as he steered her toward the parking lot you havent got your coat worried about me not in the least annoyed she reached for her keys have we finished conducting business for the evening he asked her as she stuck the key in the door lock yes completely completely good he turned her to face him kept his hands firmly on her shoulders and took her mouth with his liv was too stunned to protest she hadnt been prepared for that kind of move from thorpe she hadnt expected that hard uncompromising mouth to be soft and gentle he drew her closer and she was pressed against him his body was hard firm and arousing her blood began to heat liv lifted her hands not certain whether she would draw him closer or push him away she ended by curling her fingers into the material of his shirt thorpe made no attempt to deepen the kiss or seek quick intimacy he could sense her struggle against responding and knew he would simply wait her out he blocked out his own needs and concentrated on hers slowly her lips softened yielded she could feel the world slip out of focus as if a new lens had been placed on a camera and hadnt yet been adjusted no she murmured against his mouth and uncurled her hands to push him away no when he released her liv leaned back against the car feelings she had thought completely dead had begun to flicker into life she didnt want them didnt want thorpe to be the man to revitalize them she stared at him while he watched the emotion the vulnerability run over her face he felt something more complex than desire move through him that liv swallowed and tried to speak again that was very enjoyable olivia for both of us he kept his voice light for himself as well as for her though it would appear that youre a bit out of practice her eyes flared and the cloudiness vanished youre insufferable be ready at eight on saturday liv he told her and walked back into orileys chapter contents prev next she chose a plain black dress it fit her closely from neck to hem with no glitter no flounces to spoil the line against the unrelieved black her skin glowed like marble liv hesitated over jewelry then decided on the pearl studs she had received on her twentyfirst birthday for a moment she only held the earrings in her hand they brought memories bittersweet twentyone she had thought nothing could mar her life her happiness hardly more than a year later her world had started to crumble at twentythree she hadnt been able to remember what it had been like to feel happy she tried to recall what doug had said when he had given her the pearls liv shut her eyes a moment it had been something about their being like her skin pale and smooth doug she mused my husband she looked down at her ringless hands exhusband we loved each other then i think for the four years we were together for at least part of them before feeling the pain well up she shut her eyes again she couldnt think of what she had lost it was too enormous too irreplaceable seven years had passed since he had given her the earrings she had been a different woman then in a different life it was time for this woman to wear them again in the life she had now liv put the earrings on and went to find her shoes it was nearly eight oclock she was nervous and tried to convince herself that she wasnt she hadnt been on a date in years its not a date she reminded herself its business a professional courtesy and why was thorpe suddenly showing her courtesy of any kind liv sat with one shoe on and the other in her hand he wasnt a man she should trust personally or professionally on the job he was ruthless and proprietary shed known that from the outset and now the way he had kissed her just like that just as if he had the right to she chewed on her bottom lip and stared into space he hadnt led up to it she would have thrown up the barricades if he had she knew the signs to look for the smiles the soft promising words thorpe hadnt spared any of those it was an impulse she decided and shrugged it off there hadnt been anything desperate or even particularly loverlike in the kiss he hadnt been rough he hadnt tried a seduction she was making too much of it she had wanted to kiss him she had wanted to go on kissing him to be held close to be needed desired why he meant nothing to her she told herself firmly what do you want she whispered to herself and why dont you know to be the best she thought to win to be olivia carmichael without having to lose pieces of myself along the way i want to be whole again the doorbell rang business she reminded herself im going to be the best reporter in washington if i have to socialize with tc thorpe to do it then ill socialize with tc thorpe she glanced at the perfume on her dresser then turned away from it there was no point in giving him any ideas she felt sure he had enough of his own she moved through the apartment without hurry it gave her a small touch of satisfaction to keep him waiting but when liv opened the door thorpe didnt appear annoyed there was approval and simple male appreciation for a woman in his eyes you look lovely thorpe handed her a single rosebud longstemmed and white it suits you he said as she accepted it without a word reds too obvious pinks too sweet liv stared down at the flower and forgot everything she had just told herself she hadnt counted on being moved by him again so quickly she lifted serious eyes to his thank you thorpe smiled but his tone was as serious as hers youre welcome are you going to let me in id be smarter not to she thought abruptly but stepped back ill go put this in water thorpe scanned the living room as she walked away it was neat tastefully furnished no decorator he thought she had taken her time here choosing precisely what she wanted he noted that there were no photographs no mementos liv wasnt putting any parts of herself on display very careful very private the vague hint of secrecy had aroused his reporters instincts it might be time he considered for a bit of gentle probing he walked into the kitchen and leaned on the door as liv added water to a crystal bud vase nice place he said conversationally you have a good view of the city yes washingtons a far cry from connecticut what part are you from liv raised her eyes they were cool again cautious westport westport carmichael thorpe had no trouble with the connection tyler carmichaels your father liv lifted the vase from the sink and turned to him yes tyler carmichael real estate staunch conservative roots straight back to the mayflower there had been two daughters thorpe remembered suddenly hed forgotten because one had simply slipped from notice a decade before while the other had struck out on the debutante circuit fivethousanddollar dresses and a pink rolls her daddys darling when she had graduated from radcliffe and snapped up her first husband a playwright carmichael had given her a fifteenacre estate as a wedding present melinda carmichael howard leclare was now on husband number two she was a nervous spoiled woman with a desperate sort of beauty and a taste for the expensive ive met your sister thorpe commented studying livs face youre nothing like her no liv agreed simply and moved past him into the living room she set the rose down on a small glass table ill get my coat a good reporter thorpe mused makes the worst interview subject they know how to answer questions with a yes or no and without inflection olivia carmichael was a good reporter so was he you dont get along with your family i didnt say that liv chose a hiplength fox fur from her closet you didnt have to smoothly thorpe took the coat and held it out liv slipped her arms into the sleeves she wore no scent he noted just the light lingering fragrance from her bath and the clean faintly citrus scent from shampoo the lack of artifice aroused him he turned her so that she faced him why dont you get along with them liv let out an annoyed breath look thorpe arent you ever going to call me by my first name she lifted a brow and waited a beat terrance he grinned nobody calls me that and lives to tell about it liv laughed it was the first time hed heard her laugh and mean it she leaned down to pick up her bag you never answered my question thorpe pointed out and unexpectedly took her hand as she turned back to him and im not going to no personal questions thorpe on or off the record im a stubborn man liv dont brag its unattractive he laced his fingers with hers then lifted the joined hands and studied them thoughtfully they fit he decided giving her an odd smile i thought they might she wasnt used to this it wasnt a seduction though she was feeling stirrings of desire it wasnt a challenge though she felt the need to fight it wasnt even an assumption she could dispute he had simply stated a fact arent we going to be late liv said a little desperately she found it strange that though his eyes never left hers she could feel their gaze through her coat through her dress on her skin she would have sworn he knew precisely what she looked like right down to the small sickleshaped birthmark under her left breast thorpe there was a quick sense of panic at what she was feeling dont hurt he saw it he sensed it she had been hurt he reminded himself of his decision to move slowly keeping her hand in his he walked to the door light music elegance liv wondered how many parties she had been to in her life what made this party different from hundreds of others politics it was a hardedged intimate little world you were appointed or elected but always an open target for the press vulnerable because of their influence on the public one group habitually accused the other of staging the news sometimes it was true whether at a social event or an official one there were images to project liv understood images the senator nibbling pate was a liberal his hair was boyishly styled around an open ingenuous face liv knew he was sharp as a tack and viciously ambitious a veteran congressman told a slightly offcolor story about marlin fishing he was lobbying furiously against a pending tax proposal liv spotted a reporter for an influential washington paper drinking steadily by her count he had downed five bourbons without showing a flicker but his fingers were curled around the glass as though it were a life preserver and he were drowning she recognized the signs and felt a stir of pity if he wasnt already drinking his breakfast he soon would be everybody handles pressure differently thorpe commented noting where livs gaze had focused i suppose i had a friend on a newspaper in austin she said as she accepted the glass of wine thorpe offered her who used to say newspapers gave information to the thinking public while television put on a show he lit a cigarette what did you say to her i pointed out that the ads scattered through the new york times werent any different than commercials in a broadcast she smiled remembering her earnest fellow reporter i would say that television was more immediate shed say newspapers were more reflective id say television allowed the viewer to see shed say print allowed a reader to think shrugging she sipped the cool dry wine we were both right i suppose i did some print reporting when i was in college thorpe watched liv study the people her surroundings she was soaking it all up now she looked back at him curious why did you switch to broadcasting i liked the faster pace the sense of reaching people on the spot she nodded understanding perfectly there was a glass of scotch in his hand unlike the reporter she had observed thorpe drank moderately but smoked too much she decided she thought of carl and his endless chain of cigarettes how do you deal with the pressure he grinned then surprised her by running a thumb over the pearl in her ear i row what his touch had distracted her now she focused fully on his face again row he repeated a boat on the river theres handball when its too cold rowing liv mused that would explain the calloused worked feeling of his palms yes you know go yale she smiled at that a quick smile that lit her eyes thats the first time youve done that for me he said smiled with your whole face i think im in love youre tougher than that thorpe a marshmallow he corrected and lifted her hand to his lips carefully she removed her hand from his her fingertips were tingling no marshmallow was responsible for that expose on misappropriation of funds in the interior department last november thats work he took a step closer so that their bodies nearly touched the man is a pathetic romantic weakened by candlelight devastated by a chopin prelude a woman could have me for the price of an open fire and a bottle of wine liv lifted her glass again it had to be the wine that was making her feel unsteady and thousands have you told me not to brag he grinned and reporting limits your time liv was having a difficult time keeping her distance she shook her head and sighed i dont want to like you thorpe i really dont dont rush into anything he advised genially tc the gentleman from virginia clapped a hand on thorpes shoulder i knew id find you with an attractive woman he ran an appreciative eye over liv senator wyatt was a few pounds overweight pink cheeked and jovial liv knew he was leading a campaign to kill proposed cuts in education and welfare she had been fighting to get past his front door for two weeks senator thorpe took the heavyhanded greeting genially olivia carmichael livs hand was pumped in the best senatorial style well now i dont forget faces and ive seen this one but ill swear youre not one of tcs regulars thorpe made a sound that was somewhere between throat clearing and sighing liv shot him a glance im with wwbw senator wyatt mr thorpe and i are colleagues yes yes of course i remember perfectly now tc fancies a different type he leaned closer to liv and winked lots of leg short on brains is that so liv aimed a thoughtful look at thorpe you have great legs liv thorpe commented so ive been told she turned to wyatt id very much like to speak with you senator about your stand on the proposed education cuts perhaps you could suggest a more appropriate time wyatt hesitated a moment then nodded call my office monday morning you two should be dancing he decided and straightened his dinner jacket with a quick tug im going to see if i can find any real food at that buffet fish eggs and goose liver with a grimace he sauntered away thorpe took her hand when liv glanced up at him he smiled just taking the senators advice he explained keeping to the edge of the dance floor he drew her into his arms it was the second time she had been held against him the second time her body had responded despite herself liv went rigid dont you like to dance olivia he murmured yes she made an effort to keep her voice cool and even of course then relax his hand was light at her waist his mouth close to her ear small thrills trembled along her skin when we make love it wont be with members of washingtons brass looking on i like privacy because she had been struggling with the first part of his statement it took a moment for the second part to penetrate liv threw her head back so that their eyes met what makes you think not think know he corrected your hearts racing just as it did when i kissed you outside of orileys it is not she denied hotly it wasnt then it isnt now i told you before thorpe i dont like you more recently you said you didnt want to like me a totally different thing she was so slender he wanted to press her closer until she melted into him i could find out how you feel right now if i kissed you the federal grapevine would be buzzing about thorpe and carmichael fraternizing on neutral ground the lead story would be thorpes broken jaw when carmichael severs diplomatic relations you dont have the hands for packing much of a punch he mused anyway i prefer reporting stories not being featured in them liv drew away when the music ended im going to check out your theory about the ladies room she said evenly her heart was racing she detested him for being right thorpe watched her move away he suddenly wished the damn party were over so he could have her alone even for a few minutes his body still tingled from the brush of hers against it he had never wanted a woman so badly nor been as frustratingly certain of the uphill battle he had yet to fight taking out a cigarette he flicked on his lighter and drew deeply he was used to pressure in his work in truth he thrived on it that was his secret he could go for days on snatches of sleep and still throb with energy he didnt need vitamins just a story but this was a different sort of pressure wanting something and knowing it was still out of reach not for long he decided grimly and drew on the cigarette again if he had to lay siege to olivia carmichael thats exactly what hed do she wasnt getting away from him tc you pirate how are you thorpe turned and clasped hands with the canadian ambassadors press secretary returning the greeting he reminded himself to relax a successful siege took time liv took her time renewing makeup which needed no renewing she tried as she dusted powder on her nose to consider her response to thorpe logically hadnt she termed him a charismatic man even attractive she admitted reluctantly in a purely physical athletic way that had nothing to do with his being difficult and frustrating of course hes a pompous old bat but i rather like him liv glanced in the glass to see the reflections of two women who entered one was congresswoman amelia thaxter a thin hardworking woman who had a penchant for lost causes and dowdy clothes her constituents loved her proving it by electing her for a second term by a landslide the woman with her who was speaking was also fiftyish but plumper and dressed in elegant gray silk there was something vaguely familiar about her liv took out her compact a second time and listened youre more tolerant than i am myra amelia sat down and tiredly took out a comb rods not a bad sort amelia myra sat and took out a silver case of flashy red lipstick if youd use a bit of honey you might find him a help instead of a hindrance hes not concerned with the ecological problems of south dakota amelia put in she hadnt bothered to use the comb but kept tapping it against the palm of her hand no matter what you or i say to him tonight hes not going to support me when i put my proposal on the floor monday well see myra slashed on the lipstick rod liv realized as she slipped a thin brush out of her purse was roderick matte one of the more influential men in congress if a vote was going to be close he was the man to sway a pompous old bat liv thought and suppressed a grin yes he was that as well as his partys hope for the highest office in washington in the next election or so the rumors went the congresswoman muttered at the comb then stuck it back in her purse hes a bigoted narrowminded pain in the my dear myra said sweetly interrupting her friends impassioned speech with a smile for liv thats a perfectly stunning dress thank you didnt i see you with tc the woman took out a small vial of expensive perfume and used it lavishly yes we came together liv vacillated between identifying herself and keeping silent she decided it was both wiser and more fair to establish her credentials im olivia carmichael with wwbw amelia made a small unidentifiable sound but myra pressed on undisturbed how interesting i dont watch the local news im afraid or much news at all except for tcs reports news tends to give herbert indigestion justice herbert ditmyer liv finally placed the face justice ditmyers wife myra a woman with power and influence enough of her own to call congressman matte a pompous old bat without fear of repercussions were on at fivethirty mrs ditmyer olivia told her your husband might find our broadcast easy to digest myra laughed but she was studying liv carefully i know some carmichaels connecticut you wouldnt be tylers younger daughter would you liv was used to the nameless term yes i am myras face split into a smile isnt that something the last time i saw you you were seven or eight years old your mother was giving a proper little tea and you came into the parlor a scruffy thing with a rip the size of a fist in your skirt and the buckle off your shoe i believe you got quite a scold i usually did liv agreed not remembering the particular incident but others like it i remember thinking you must have had a great deal more fun that afternoon than the rest of us did she gave a gleaming smile your mother gave a stuffy party myra really amelia took her mind from her pending bill long enough to give a disapproving tshtsh its all right congresswoman liv said smoothly she still does i believe i must say i would never have recognized you myra rose and brushed off her skirt quite an elegant young woman now married no are you and tc she let the sentence trail off delicately no liv said positively do you play bridge liv lifted a brow poorly i never acquired a taste for it my dear a detestable game but useful she plucked a business card out of her bag and handed it to liv im having a card party next week call my secretary monday shell give you the details i have a nephew im rather fond of mrs ditmyer he wont bore you at least not too much myra continued smoothly and i think im going to like you my husband will be there she added shrewd enough to dangle tempting bait before the reporter hed love to meet you lets go back myra amelia suggested wearily rising before youre up on bribery charges good evening ms carmichael good evening congresswoman alone liv studied the elegant little calling card for a moment then dropped it into her purse one didnt turn up ones nose at a direct invitation from myra ditmyer even if it included bridge and a nephew snapping her purse shut liv rejoined the party i was beginning to think you were holding a press conference in there thorpe commented offering her a fresh glass of wine she gave him an enigmatic smile close want to elaborate does accepting your invitation mean i have to share liv took a careless sip of wine she was feeling curiously buoyant three unexpected contacts in one evening was well worth the trip actually she continued i believe im going to be a blind date at a bridge party date thorpe frowned he had noted the women who had come out of the powder room before liv yes date you know a man and a woman finding a common interest for a certain number of hours cute had enough of this place as a matter of fact yes liv took a last sip then handed him back the glass well get your coat he took her arm and propelled her through the room i do appreciate your letting me tag along thorpe liv reached for her keys as they stepped from the elevator on her floor tag along he repeated that wasnt included in your definition of a date was it this wasnt a date still thorpe took the keys from her and slipped one into the lock on the door good manners would buy me a cup of coffee fifty cents would buy you one down the street liv thorpe gave her an offended look that made her smile all right manners it is a cups worth youre incredibly generous he told her as he opened the door liv tossed her coat on a chair as she walked to the kitchen he eyed the coat with a small smile now and again she forgot the carefully created image she had built olivia carmichael would never throw down a coat much too fastidious much too organized more than ever thorpe wanted to know the woman behind the image there was warmth there humor passion all hidden behind a thin shield the shield had been raised for a reason he intended sooner or later to find out what it was she liked color he decided hed noted it before in the way she dressed now he noted it again in the furnishings of her apartment a brilliant blue throw pillow a persimmoncolored bowl small signs of fire he thought like the quick flare of temper she banked it constantly but it was there how do you take your coffee she called out as he walked to the kitchen black he wandered to the stereo and flipped through records van cliburn to billy joel he commented when liv came back into the room very eclectic i like variety she answered and set a tray with two cups and saucers on the coffee table do you he smiled a bit she thought as if he were enjoying a private joke liv began to wish she hadnt agreed to the cup of coffee what do you do for entertainment thorpe walked over and took a seat on the sofa liv hesitated a moment then sat beside him she could hardly choose a chair across the room entertainment she repeated and reached for her coffee thats right he had noticed the hesitation it pleased him to know that she wasnt indifferent toward him if he made her nervous it was a beginning you know bowling stamp collecting i havent had much time for hobbies lately liv murmured and sipped at her coffee she wondered why she had been at ease when she had walked out of the kitchen and was now strung tight thorpe lit a cigarette and kept watching her she struggled against an adolescent urge to move away from him what have you had time for i work she said and moved her shoulders why was a simple cup of coffee and conversation making her pulse pound that keeps me busy enough sunday afternoons what she had looked up to meet his eyes before she realized the mistake his were dark and direct and closer than she had thought sunday afternoons he repeated he didnt touch her his eyes drifted slowly down to her mouth then back what do you do on sunday afternoons something was kindling inside her something elemental and strong liv hadnt felt the quick tug of desire for years but he wasnt touching her wasnt making love to her they were only drinking coffee and talking she told herself she had had too much wine and lifted her coffee again i usually try to catch up on my reading she watched a plume of smoke drift by before thorpe crushed out his cigarette murder mysteries thrillers her eyes flew up again when thorpe took the cup from her hand ive always liked solving puzzles he murmured digging underneath to find something thats not on the surface youve very thin skin he brushed a knuckle over her cheek but i havent been able to get beneath it not yet she started to draw away i dont want you poking into my mind well save that for later then he slid his arms around her i want to hold you when we were dancing i promised myself id hold you again when we were alone you dont want him to hold you her mind insisted but she didnt tell him and didnt resist as he pressed her closer his eyes flicked briefly to her mouth ive wanted for days to taste you again lightly his lips rubbed over hers too long he muttered you dont want him to kiss you her mind insisted but she didnt tell him and didnt resist as he crushed her mouth with his thorpe wasnt patient this time the demand seemed to spring up hot almost violent liv was caught in it stunned by his lightning passion and her own instant response she had no time to think to reason only to react her arms locked around him her lips parted where had the urgency come from both of them seemed trapped by it unable to keep to their planned routes she couldnt stop him or herself he couldnt adhere to the easy pace he had outlined desperation they both felt it need outrageous need to taste and touch and belong he hadnt known her mouth would become so soft in passion he wanted to rip the black dress from her and discover her it was madness control was slipping from him too quickly liv moaned when his mouth went to her throat she wanted to be touched and heard herself telling him then pressed against him as he caressed her breast through the thin layers of silk she pulled his mouth back to hers she was starving and took from him what she had so long denied herself she craved the intimacy of his tongue against hers the feel of his hands roaming her body there was strength there and need a need for her and he made her need him with an intensity that frightened her she couldnt allow herself to need anyone again the risks were too great the punishment too severe no liv pushed against him in sudden panic no she said again and managed to draw back if not away his hands stayed firm on her shoulders she could see the raw desire in his eyes knew it must be mirrored in her own no what his voice was rough halfangry halfaroused he hadnt expected the brutal degree of passion she had brought out in him you have to go liv pulled out of his hold and stood she needed distance needed to stand on her feet thorpe rose more slowly i want you it was a simple statement almost flat as he fought against the throbbing that beat inside him you want me it would have been absurd to deny it liv took a deep breath yes but i dont want to want you she let the breath out again i wont thorpe felt his control snap he grabbed her and pulled her against him he saw her eyes widen as the pupils dilated the hell you wont he said quietly he released her again so quickly that she nearly tumbled back onto the sofa he stuck his hands in his pockets to keep them off her this isnt the end of it carmichael he warned before he turned for the door its just the beginning he let the door swing closed behind him as he headed for the elevator he needed a drink chapter contents prev next the tape on the school board meetings still being edited liv glanced briefly at the clock before she sat down to review the script for the evening broadcast id have more time she thought fleetingly if i hadnt had to do those teases know what the story count is tonight brian stripped the wrapper from a chocolate bar and sat on livs desk hmm eighteen he took a generous bite were packing them in the general managers frantic because we slipped a couple notches in the ratings i heard he wants to change the tone of the weather forecast go for the chuckles maybe hell hire a comedy writer or put on a ventriloquist and a magic act liv mumbled gimmicks annoyed her even as she spoke to brian she was running over her timing on the stories she would soon read on the air the next thing you know well have the weather being given by a guy in a clown suit standing on one leg and juggling plates maybe we need the comic relief brian balled the candy wrapper and pitched it into livs wastebasket lead storys the rape in the supermarket parking lot so i see she was skimming the copy one eye on it the other on the clock with her attention divided between the script and her colleague it was a skill most reporters developed early marilee did a spooky little standup out there i just saw the tape he swallowed the last of the chocolate my wife shops there damn everything in here tonights grim liv glanced up running a hand over the back of her neck wholesale prices are up six percent unemployments following suit two robberies in northeast and an arson in anne arundel county to add to the rape lovely like i said maybe we need that comic relief i want to see daffodils she said suddenly weariness settled over her all at once was it the tone of the news she wondered surely by now she was immune to it was it something else something had been nagging inside her for the last few days something she couldnt quite pinpoint it had kept her awake long after thorpe had left her apartment the night before brian studied her a moment hed noticed the faint shadows under her eyes that morning it was past five now and they were deeper is it something youd like to talk about liv opened her mouth surprised by the question she shut it again there was nothing she could say i know somethings been eating at you lately he leaned a bit closer so other ears wouldnt overhear his words look why dont you come to dinner tonight ill call kathy and tell her to add a can of water to the soup sometimes a few hours with friends helps liv smiled and squeezed his hand thats the nicest invitation ive had in a long time so dont turn it down i have to ive got something lined up tonight the offer made her feel better less isolated can i have a rain check sure he rose but liv took his hand before he moved away brian thanks she tightened the grip a moment when he started to shrug it off i mean it youre welcome he pulled her to her feet its nearly airtime youd better haul yourself into makeup and have them do something about those shadows under your eyes liv lifted her fingers to them automatically that bad bad enough with a quiet oath liv walked off to follow brians advice the last thing she needed was to appear haggard on the air it would be her luck to go on looking as if she hadnt slept and then have thorpe catch her broadcast so i havent been sleeping well liv thought as she took her place on the set it hasnt anything to do with thorpe ive just been a bit restless lately and i was at the southwest gate of the white house at eight oclock this morning waiting to catch comments from cabinet officials im a bit tired it has nothing to do with the night of the embassy party or what happened later liv clipped on her mike then flipped through the script one last time timing was important as story was piled on top of story shed been working too hard thats what she told herself the last few days had been particularly hectic that was all tc thorpe had been the last thing on her mind thered been the aftermath of dells appointment then that mess at the school board to cover she frowned down at the script and told herself she hadnt given a thought to her last meeting with thorpe it hadnt crossed her mind since it happened not once only a thousand times swearing silently she heard the thirtysecond cue she straightened in her chair and glanced up thorpe stood in the back of the studio he was watching her steadily eyes level as he leaned back against the heavy doors fifteen seconds what is he doing here liv felt her throat go dry ridiculous she told herself and tore her eyes away from his to the camera ten seconds the monitor was flashing the opening an aerial view of the city five seconds four three two one cue good evening this is olivia carmichael her voice was cool and precise it amazed her that her palms were damp she read off the lead story then never glanced toward the rear of the studio as they went to tape for the reporters standup on location the cameras switched between liv and brian keeping the pace brisk she gave her report on the school board meeting without missing a beat though she could feel the physical pressure of thorpes eyes on her face she gave the depressing news on the wholesale price index to her knowledge thorpe never came to the studio before or during a broadcast why wasnt he upstairs where he belonged polishing his own words of wisdom there was a buildup of tension at the base of her neck which increased when they broke for commercial liv knew without glancing over that he was coming toward her nice style liv thorpe commented sharp cool and clean thank you the sportscaster settled into his chair at the end of the table going to the ditmyer card party tonight there was nothing he didnt know she decided and folded her hands over her copy yes want a lift now she met his eyes directly are you going ill pick you up at seventhirty well grab some dinner first no he leaned a bit closer i can arrange for you to be my partner tonight youll lose she told him she had never known a set of commercials to take so long no he corrected and smiled i dont intend to lose he kissed her quickly casually before she could prevent it then sauntered away thirty seconds she scowled as the doors swung behind his back without turning she could feel the speculative gazes on her thorpe had successfully set the ball rolling and the tongues wagging ten seconds fuming she vowed to make him pay for it cue liv arrived at the ditmyers promptly at eight bridge wasnt the inducement she could remember the dry stuffy card parties her mother had given when she was growing up liv remembered myras flashy red lipstick and careless gossip from the powder room at the embassy she pressed the doorbell and smiled she didnt think myra ditmyer gave stuffy parties and she reminded herself how often does a reporter get invited to the home of a justice of the supreme court unless of course the reporters name was tc thorpe liv frowned then quickly smoothed out her features as the door opened though it was a maid who led liv inside myra herself came bustling down the hall seconds later it was obvious liv thought smiling to herself that myra was a woman who didnt like to miss anything olivia myra clasped both of her hands warmly so glad you could come i like having beautiful women around i was one myself once as she talked she was pulling liv with her down the hall i watched your newscast youre good thank you myra propelled liv into a large drawing room you must meet herbert she went on i reminded him of the tea with your parents and your torn dress but he didnt remember herberts mind is filled with weighty matters he often misses details but you dont liv decided as she was pulled through the room at top speed it was spacious accented with splashes of vivid color and ornately patterned wallpaper liv decided the room suited her hostess perfectly herbert myra snatched her husband away from a conversation without a moments hesitation you must meet lovely ms carmichael she does the newscast on what is the name of that station dear wwbw liv extended her hand to justice ditmyer were the washington affiliate of cnc all those initials myra commented with a cluck of her tongue it would be simpler if they just gave it a name isnt she beautiful herbert yes indeed the justice smiled with the handshake a pleasure to meet you ms carmichael he was a small and liv thought curiously unimposing man without the black robes of his office his face was lean and lined he looked like someones grandfather rather than one of the top judiciary leaders of the country the skin of his hand was soft and thin with age he lacked the vitality of his wife possessing instead a quiet stability myra tells me we met briefly a number of years ago a great number of years ago justice ditmyer liv agreed i disgraced myself i believe so were both to be forgiven for not remembering and she hardly resembles that little wildcat who burst into tea that afternoon myra put in she was eyeing liv with her goodnatured shrewdness how does your mother feel about your career in television she wishes id chosen something less public liv astonished herself by saying it wasnt like her to be so frank with strangers myra ditmyer she decided would have made a terrific interviewer ah well parents are so hard to please arent they myra brushed it off with a smile and a pat on livs hand my children find me terribly difficult dont they herbert so they tell me all nicely married now she continued overlooking her husbands dry response so ive time to work on my nephew nice boy a lawyer he lives in chicago i believe i mentioned him yes mrs ditmyer liv heard the justice sigh and tried not to echo with one of her own hes here on business for a few days i do want you to meet him myra scanned the room quickly then her eyes lit yes there he is greg she lifted her voice and her hand in a signal greg come over here a moment i have a lovely girl for you to meet she cant help it justice ditmyer said in an aside to liv a dyedinthewool busybody romantic myra corrected greg you must meet olivia shes a newscaster liv turned to meet the nephew and stared an avalanche of memories crashed down on her if any words had formed in her brain she wouldnt have been able to speak them greg stared back equally stunned livvy he reached out a hand to touch hers as if to reassure himself she was real is it really you she wasnt certain what she felt surprise yes but she couldnt separate pleasure from anxiety the past it seemed refused to stay buried greg she hoped her face wasnt as pale as her voice this is incredible he smiled now and pulled her against him for a hug absolutely incredible what has it been five years it appears you two know each other already myra said wryly livvy and i were in college together greg drew her away to take a long look my god youre more beautiful than ever it doesnt seem possible he lifted his hand with the privilege of an old friend and touched her hair youve cut it he glanced at his aunt it used to be down to her waist straight as a dime every woman in harvard envied livvy her hair he turned back to her still this suits you very chic there were a hundred questions jumbled in her head but she couldnt bring herself to ask them he looked almost the same hardly older though the beard he had sported in college had been trimmed down to a moustache it suited him sandy blond like his hair and gave his almost boyish face an air of experience his eyes were as friendly as ever and his smile as enthusiastic five years seemed to evaporate in an instant oh greg its good to see you again this time it was she who hugged him it didnt matter that college was a million years behind her it mattered only that he was there for her to touch and hold on to someone she had known in happier times and in sadder ones im going to steal her from you for a few minutes aunt myra greg gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before taking livs hand weve got some catching up to do well well myra beamed as she watched them walk away that worked out better than i planned she glanced over and lifted a brow tc just came in myra smiled and ran her tongue over her teeth i think ill have a word with him now myra justice ditmyer laid a restraining hand on her arm dont go stirring up trouble herb she patted the hand before she drew away from it dont spoil my fun greg led liv through a pair of corridors and into the solarium i just cant believe it running into you like this its fantastic when we were in college i didnt know you had such illustrious relatives i didnt want comparisons he told her the moonlight was dim and because he wanted to see her greg switched on a low light living up to family expectations can be traumatic i know what you mean liv wandered to one of the windows it was an interesting semicircular room with cushioned benches and a light scent of flowers she didnt sit seeing greg again so unexpectedly had unnerved her liv thought better on her feet how long have you been in washington livvy she was slimmer now than he remembered and more poised five years sweet lord he thought it could have been yesterday almost a year and a half she tried to remember the last time anyone had called her livvy that too she realized had been left in another life aunt myra said you were a newscaster yes she turned back to him in the shadowed light her beauty struck him like a blow hed never gotten used to it im coanchor on the evening news at wwbw its what you always wanted no more weather reports she smiled no there were no rings on her fingers greg crossed to her her scent was different he noticed more sophisticated less artless are you happy she kept her eyes level as she thought over the question i think so you used to be more definite about things i used to be younger carefully she moved away from him she wanted to keep it light so your aunt tells me youre single she would greg laughed and shook his head whenever im in town she finds an eligible female to dangle in front of me this is the first time ive appreciated it you never married greg id always thought you would you turned me down she faced him again and smiled gravely you were never serious not enough my mistake he took her hand between both of his it was still fine boned and fragile a contrast to the strength in her eyes and you were too crazy about doug to see it if i had been he saw her expression change even as she started to turn away livvy greg stopped her doug and i are partners in chicago for a moment she didnt speak she had to fight through a wave of pain for the easy words thats what you both had planned im glad it worked out for you those first few months after he stopped wanting to choose his words carefully after you left werent easy for him neither were the last few months before she felt cold suddenly it was a bad time the worst kind of time for both of you liv drew a deep breath she didnt often allow herself to remember you were a good friend to us greg i dont think i ever told you just how good it was a difficult period of my life you made it a bit easier now she returned the pressure of his hand i dont think i realized that until much later i hated to watch you hurting livvy when she turned away he took her shoulders and rested his head on her hair theres nothing that makes you feel more helpless than watching people you care about in pain everything that happened seemed so unjust at the time it still does liv leaned back against him she remembered he had tried to comfort her all those years ago but she had been beyond it then doug and i didnt handle it well did we greg i dont know he hesitated a moment wondering if he should tell her perhaps it was best for her to know everything livvy dougs married again she said nothing at all somehow she had known he would be had been all but sure of it does it matter she asked herself she had loved him once but that was over dead love was long dead still she felt a wave of grief for what they had had what they had lost a long shuddering sigh broke from her is he happy yes i think so hes put his life back together greg turned liv to face him have you yes she went into his arms wanting to be held by someone who understood yes most of the time my works important i needed something important to keep me sane ive put all those years behind me into their own little box i dont open it often less and less as the years pass she closed her eyes the grief was still there only dulled by time dont tell him you saw me she lifted her face so that she met gregs eyes he shouldnt open the box either you always were strong livvy stronger than doug i think he had a hard time accepting that so did i she sighed again and rested against him i wanted too much from him he didnt want enough from me suddenly she clung to him when the one thing that bound us together was gone we fell apart picking up the pieces is hell greg im still missing some and i dont even know where to look for them youll find them livvy she felt him kiss her hair then lifted her face to smile at him im awfully glad i was the female your aunt chose to dangle in front of you this trip ive missed you he would like to have kissed her as a man kisses a woman who has always held a special place in his heart but he knew her too well he touched her lips lightly with his excuse me livs eyes flew to the doorway even in the shadows she could make out thorpes silhouette carefully she drew out of gregs arms angry that thorpe had discovered her in a weak unguarded moment myra needs to fill in a table bridge greg grimaced and took livs arm this is my punishment for not making it down last christmas youll have to tolerate being my partner for old times sake livvy you couldnt do much worse she knew thorpes eyes were fastened on her face and felt absurdly guilty to compensate she smiled at greg if you fix me a drink ill try not to trump your ace thorpe stepped aside as they walked through the doorway he stood in the shadows another moment watching them walk away jealousy was a new emotion he found he didnt care for it olivia carmichael belonged in a mans arms he was going to make damn sure they were his two clubs liv bid on a poor excuse for a hand she and greg had as opponents the head of thoracic surgery at a baltimore hospital and his wife they were being badly beaten neither of them played the game with much skill after a particularly humiliating hand greg jokingly challenged the surgeon and his wife to a tennis match he remembered well livs energy on the court with a grin the surgeon marked down the scoring the three other tables in the room included two senators a fivestar general and the widow of a former secretary of the treasury liv kept her ears tuned to the light political talk and gossip she wouldnt learn any state secrets but she had made contacts a reporter couldnt afford to ignore the smallest scrap of information you could never tell what could lead to bigger things liv found it ironic that a torn dress and scuffed shoes had brought her to the drawing room of a supreme court justice five spades greg took the bid and liv spread her cards on the table and rose sorry she said when he gave a small sigh at what she had to offer him tennis he muttered and played his first ace im going to get some air coward he said and shot her a grin with a laugh liv slipped out to the terrace it was still cool spring was fighting its way into washington like a dark horse candidate after the heat of the drawing room liv found the chill refreshing there was little light as clouds drifted over a halfmoon and it was quiet the rear of the house was shielded from the street sounds and hum of city traffic she heard myras boom of a laugh as she won game point how strange it was liv thought to meet greg again like this to have those bittersweet years of her life brought back extremes she mused i lived on extremes staggeringly happy unbearably sad its better this way without all those peaks and valleys of emotion safer ive had enough of risks and failures smarter wrapping her arms around herself she walked to the edge of the terrace safer and smarter you cant be hurt if you dont take chances no wrap liv she gasped and whirled she hadnt heard the terrace doors open or thorpes steps on the stone what moonlight there was shone directly on her face while his was in shadows she felt at a disadvantage its warm enough her answer was stiff she hadnt forgiven him for embarrassing her in the studio thorpe moved closer and laid his hands on her arms youre chilled nobody wants to listen to a newscaster with the sniffles he stripped off his jacket and slipped it over her shoulders i dont need keeping his hands on the lapels thorpe pulled her against him and silenced her with a bruising kiss her arms were pinned between his body and her own her mouth quickly and expertly conquered livs thoughts seemed to explode then spiral down to a small unintelligible buzz in her head she felt the unwanted pull of desire begin to take over just before his mouth lifted from hers maybe you didnt need that he kept her close still gripping the lapels of his own jacket but i did you must be crazy the words were strong and scathing but husky with awakened passion i must be he agreed easily enough otherwise i wouldnt have walked out of your apartment the other night liv let that pass the memories of her response to him were too uncomfortable you had no right pulling that business in the studio this evening kissing you she watched his grin flash i intend to make a habit of that you have a fantastic mouth listen thorpe i hear you and myras nephew are old friends he interrupted liv let out a frustrated breath i dont see what that has to do with you just weeding out the competition he said smoothly he liked holding her close waiting for the slight resistance of her body to melt competition liv would have drawn away but she was trapped in the jacket what are you talking about ill have to learn about the other men you let hold you so i can dispose of them thorpe pulled her fractionally closer the heat of his body seemed to skim along her skin his eyes were direct on hers im going to marry you livs mouth dropped open she hadnt thought it was possible for thorpe to shock her again he was a man she had learned to expect anything of but not this here was a calm matteroffact statement he might have been saying he was going to be her partner for the next round of bridge after a close thorough study of his face liv could have sworn he was completely serious now i know youre crazy she whispered really really mad his brow lifted in acknowledgment but he continued in a reasonable tone it was the tone more than anything else that left her baffled im willing to give you six months to come around im a patient man i can afford to be i dont lose thorpe youre in serious trouble you should ask for a leave of absence pressure does strange things to the mind i think itll be simpler if im straight with you he was smiling now amused by her reaction her eyes were no longer shocked but wary now youll have time to get used to the idea thorpe she said im not going to marry anyone im certainly not going to marry you now i think you should she found herself cut off again as he took her mouth her small sound of protest was muffled then silenced as his tongue slowly seduced hers she was pressed against him her arms still pinned straight down at her sides but he felt the resistance melt just as he had wanted his own desire pounded her mouth wasnt submissive but active on his she sought more even as he did clouds covered her mind and there was only sensation she could feel the somehow soft and strong texture of his lips the slow sure movement of his tongue if they had been free she would have wrapped her arms around him and clung only her mouth and the pressure of her body told him that she wanted him just as his told her she was suddenly and completely a creature of the flesh she wanted nothing more than to be touched by him her skin burned for it her body ached she murmured something neither of them could understand thorpe could feel her response he wanted her desperately the thought ran through his mind that she had been right to call him mad he wanted her to the point of madness if they had been alone if they had been alone gradually he brought himself back there would be other times other places banking his desire he lifted his mouth from hers what was it you were going to tell me to do he murmured her breathing was unsteady she struggled to remember who she was who it was who held her what he had just said to her as he smiled at her her brain began to clear see a doctor she couldnt manage more than a whisper her body was tingling quickly before you really crack too late thorpe drew her back for a last burning kiss stunned by her completely uninhibited response liv pulled out of his arms she ran a hand through her hair this is crazy she kept the hand aloft gesturing with it as if to make him see reason this is really crazy steadying she took a quick breath now ill admit im attracted to you and thats bad enough but thats the limit im going to forget all of this she slipped his jacket from her shoulders and dropped it into his hand i want you to do the same i dont know how much you had to drink in there but it must have been too much he was still smiling at her a patient smile you wipe that grin off your face thorpe she ordered and and stay away from me she stormed to the terrace doors then turned her head to look at him a last time youre crazy she added for good measure before she yanked the doors open and dashed through them chapter contents prev next there was a white rose on livs desk in the morning it stood in a slender porcelain vase a bud only with petals tightly closed of course she knew who had sent it baffled she dropped into the chair behind her desk and stared at it when she had returned to the card table the evening before she had promised herself she wouldnt think of her conversation with thorpe a sane person didnt dwell on the words of a lunatic yet there had been a long quiet stretch in the night when she had lain awake in bed every syllable of their conversation on the terrace had played back in her head and now he was sending her flowers the smart thing to do would be to dump it vase and all into the trash and forget it liv touched a fingertip to a white petal of the rose she couldnt bring herself to do it its just a flower after all she reminded herself harmless i just wont think about where it came from briskly she pulled a sheet of copy toward her she had a news brief to give in fifteen minutes liv thank god youre here she glanced up as the assignment editor barreled down on her desk chester he was an excitable usually desperate man who lived on antacids and coffee she was accustomed to this sort of greeting from him take crew two and get out to the livingston apartments in southeast a plane just crashed into the sixth floor she was up grabbing her purse and jacket any details you get them were going live as soon as youre set up an engineers going with you everybodys scattered around town or down with the flu his tone hinted that the flu was no excuse for being unavailable for assignment go theyre in the van he popped a small round mint into his mouth im gone liv dashed for the door it was worse much worse than she could ever have imagined the tail section of the plane protruded from the face of the building like the shaft of an arrow it might have been taken from a scene of a movie carefully staged fires started by the impact belched out smoke the air radiated with waves of heat and smelled pungent the building was surrounded by fire engines and police cars and they were still coming fire fighters were geared up going in or coming out of the building or spraying it with the powerful force of their hoses the lower floors were being evacuated she could hear the weeping and the shouts above the wail of sirens and crackle of the fire behind the barricades the press was already at work there were cameras and booms reporters photographers and technicians all were moving in their special organized chaos well stay portable she told bob as he hefted the camera on his shoulder for now get the building on tape a full pan of these trucks and ambulances ive never seen anything like this he muttered already focusing in on the visible section of the plane can you imagine what its like inside there liv shook her head she didnt want to there were people inside there she forced back a swell of nausea she had a story to report theres reeder she glanced in the direction bob indicated assistant fire chief okay lets see what he can tell us liv worked her way through the crowd she was jostled now and again but she was used to that she knew how to snake through masses of people to her objective and she knew the crew would follow behind her coming to the edge of the barricade she secured her position and took the mike from her soundman chief reeder olivia carmichael with wwbw she managed to get the mike out to him by leaning over the barricade and planting her feet can you tell us what happened and the status of the fire he looked impatiently at the mike then at liv charter plane out of national his voice was curt gruff and as impatient as his eyes we dont know the cause of the crash yet four floors of the building are involved of the six floors three have been evacuated can you tell me how many people are on the plane fiftytwo including crew he turned to bark an order into his twoway has there been any contact with them liv persisted reeder gave her a long silent look my men are working down from the roof and up from the lower floors how many people are still in the building talk to the landlord im busy as he walked away liv signaled to bob to stop the taping im going to try to find out how many people are still inside she turned to the sound technician go back to the radio find out if the desk knows the flight number yet the planes destination any clue to the cause of the crash well set up for a live bulletin she checked her watch five minutes right here she turned to push through the crowd again there was a woman sitting alone on the curb she was dressed in a worn robe and clutched a photo album to her breast liv backtracked from her search for the buildings landlord and went to her maam the woman looked up dry eyed pale liv crouched down beside her she recognized the look of shock you shouldnt be sitting out here in the cold liv said gently is there somewhere you can go they wouldnt let me take anything else she told liv pressing the album closer just my pictures did you hear the noise i thought it was the end of the world her voice was reed thin the sound of it pulled at liv i was fixing tea she went on all my chinas broken my mothers china im sorry the words were pitifully inadequate liv touched the womans shoulder why dont you come with me now over there the paramedics will take care of you i have friends up there the womans eyes shifted to the building mrs mcgiver in and the dawsons in they have two children did they get out yet liv heard another window explode from heat i dont know ill try to find out the little boy had the flu and had to stay home from school shock was giving way to grief liv could see the change in the womans eyes hear it in her voice i have a picture of him in here she began to weep deep tearing sobs that pulled at livs heart sitting on the curb beside her liv gathered the woman into her arms she was fragile almost paper thin liv was very much afraid that the picture would be all that was left of the dawson boy holding her close liv wept with her she felt a hand on her shoulder looking up she saw thorpe standing tall beside her thorpe she managed as he stepped in front of them her eyes were eloquent thorpe lifted the old woman from the curb gently she was still clutching the album he slipped an arm around her murmuring in her ear as he led her toward the paramedics liv let her forehead drop to her knees she had to pull herself back together if she was going to do her job a reporter couldnt afford personal involvement she could hear someone coughing violently as smoke clogged her lungs the wind brought it still closer liv thorpe took her arm and drew her to her feet im all right she said immediately she heard another explosion someone screamed oh god her eyes flew back to the building how many people are still trapped in there they havent been able to break through to the sixth floor yet anybody still on it or in that plane is gone she nodded his voice was calm and unemotional exactly what she needed yes i know she took a deep cleansing breath i need something to put on the air i have a standup to do she looked at him again what are you doing here i was on my way in to the station there was a smear on her cheek from the smoke and ash he rubbed it off with his thumb he kept his voice light this isnt my beat liv im not here for a story she looked past him to where paramedics were working frantically on a burn victim i wish to god i werent she murmured from somewhere to the left she heard a child screaming for her mother i hate this part of it poking prying into peoples pain it isnt an easy job liv he didnt touch her he wanted to but knew that wasnt what she needed she looked over as her crew made their way toward her liv took the scribbled note from the sound technician with a nod all right well shoot from here with the building at the back drawing a breath she faced the camera after im into it i want you to pan the building she took the mike again and waited for the cue that would patch her into the station then focus in on the plane before you cut back to me keep in the background noise in her earphone she heard the countdown to cue this is olivia carmichael outside the livingston apartments where at ninethirty this morning charter flight number hit the sixth floor of the building bob panned the building as she continued the cause of the crash has not yet been confirmed fire fighters are evacuating the building and working to gain access to the sixth floor and the plane there were fiftytwo people on board including crew en route to miami the camera came back to her there is no report as yet on the number of casualties burn and smokeinhalation victims are being treated here by paramedics before being transported to the hospital thorpe stood back and watched as liv continued the report her face was composed but for her eyes the horror was there whether she knew it or not it added to the impact of her facts and statistics there were still traces of soot on her cheek and her skin was dead white against it a viewer looking beyond the words would see a woman not just a reporter she was good at her job he reflected perhaps because she constantly struggled to tamp down her emotions the effort showed from time to time and made her more accessible this is olivia carmichael she concluded for wwbw she waited until they were off the air then whipped off the earphone all right get some tape of the paramedics ill find out if theyve gotten through to the sixth floor yet get a courier out here theyll need whatever weve got for the noon news liv felt the control slip back into place she wasnt going to fall apart again very efficient thorpe commented liv looked at him he was all quiet intensity all understated strength it disturbed her that for just a brief moment she had needed him simply needed to know he was there to lean on it was a luxury she couldnt afford to allow herself the trick is being good at it liv repeated lets say we finally have a point of agreement he smiled and brushed a stray lock of hair from her forehead want me to hang around she stared at him struck with conflicting emotions why was he so easily able to move her dont be nice to me thorpe she murmured please dont be nice to me its simpler when youre a louse he bent and touched her lips with his ill call you tonight dont she returned but he was already walking away swearing liv spun around she couldnt worry about thorpe she still had information to gather and a story to finish liv watched the tape on the eleven oclock news it was a different feeling than she had experienced during her own earlier broadcast sitting behind the desk giving her report and watching herself on the monitor she could separate her emotions from her job now alone in her apartment watching the tape as any other viewer the tragedy washed over her again sixtytwo people had died and fifteen more had been hospitalized including four fire fighters the reports werent official yet but it looked as though a pilot error had been responsible liv thought of the woman she had tried to comfort on the curb the precious photo album she had clutched the stunned grief then the mourning there had been no survivors from the sixth floor the time of day had been a blessing liv had said so herself in her report most of the apartments had been vacant children had been in school adults at work but the little dawson boy in had had the flu rising liv snapped off the set she couldnt think about it couldnt dwell on it she pushed at her temples it was time to take a couple of aspirin and go to bed nothing could change what had happened in the morning hours and it was time to find her distance again it occurred to her as she crawled into bed that she had missed dinner hunger might be partially responsible for the severity of her headache but she was too weary to take anything more than the aspirin shutting her eyes she lay in the darkness this is what she had decided she wanted quiet privacy no one to depend on no one to answer to what she had now was hers what mistakes she made were hers that was the best way she opened her eyes to stare at the ceiling wondering just when she had begun to doubt that the phone beside her shrilled and liv sat straight up she fumbled for the bedside lamp then picked up a pencil even as she lifted the receiver who but the desk would call her at midnight yes hello hello liv thorpe liv dropped the pencil and lay back he was incredible did i wake you yes she lied what do you want i wanted to say good night she sighed then was grateful he couldnt see her smile she didnt want to give him any encouragement you woke me up to say good night ive been tied up i just got home thorpe yanked off his tie if there was one thing he hated about the job it was ties want to know where ive been no liv returned dauntingly and heard him chuckle damn it she thought then propped her pillow behind her she did want to know all right where were you at a meeting with levowitz levowitz her attention was caught the bureau chief thats the one thorpe pried off his shoes i didnt know he was in washington the wheels began to turn in her head levowitz wouldnt make a trip from new york to dc without good cause what did he want harris mcdowells going to retire at the end of the year he offered me the spot the news wasnt nearly as surprising as his casualness being offered mcdowells job was nothing to take lightly exposure power money to be considered capable of stepping into mcdowells shoes was no idle compliment it was an accolade liv searched around for something to say and settled on congratulations i didnt take it now she waited a full beat what i didnt take it thorpe pulled off his socks and tossed them in the direction of the hamper youre off this weekend he began wait a minute liv sat up straighten you turned down the most prestigious position in cnc or any other news organization in the country you could put it that way if you want he lit a cigarette from his second pack that day why thorpe blew out a stream of smoke i like working the field i dont want to anchor at least not in new york about this weekend olivia youre a strange man thorpe she settled back against the pillows she couldnt quite figure him out a very strange man most reporters would kill for the job im not most reporters no she said slowly considering no youre not youd make a good anchor well he smiled as he unbuttoned his shirt thats quite a compliment from you want some company thorpe im in bed if thats an invitation i accept unable to do otherwise she laughed no its not i havent had a conversation like this since high school we can go out and neck in the back seat of my car no thanks thorpe relaxed she snuggled down into the pillows when was the last time she wondered that she had had a foolish conversation in the middle of the night if you only called to say good night actually i called about tomorrow afternoon what about it liv yawned and closed her eyes ive got two tickets for opening game he stripped off his shirt and tossed it to follow the socks opening game of what good god liv baseball orioles against the red sox he sounded so sincerely shocked by her ignorance she smiled dick andrews handles sports broaden your outlook he advised ill pick you up at twelvethirty thorpe she began im not going out with you its not a seduction liv that comes later its a ball game hot dogs and beer its an american tradition liv turned off the light and pulled the covers up over her shoulders i dont think im making myself clear she murmured try it again tomorrow palmers pitching thats very exciting im sure but twelvethirty he repeated we want to get there early enough to find a parking place sleepy she yawned again and let herself drift it was probably simpler to agree what harm could it do besides shed never been to a ball game youre not going to wear one of those hats are you he grinned no i leave that to the players twelvethirty good night thorpe good night carmichael she was smiling as she hung up just before she drifted into sleep she realized her headache had disappeared chapter contents prev next memorial stadium was packed when they arrived liv was to learn that baltimore was very enthusiastic about their orioles there were not as she had presupposed only men wearing fielders caps and clutching beers in the stands she saw women children young girls college students whiteand bluecollar workers there must be something to it she concluded to draw out so many people third base dugout thorpe told her gesturing down the concrete steps what thats where were sitting he explained behind the third base dugout come on taking her arm he propelled her down she frowned out at the field trying to put together what she knew of the sport with the white lines brown dirt and grass know anything about baseball thorpe asked her liv thought a moment then smiled at him three strikes and youre out he laughed and took his seat youll get a crash course today want a beer is it unamerican to have a coke instead while he signaled a roving concessionaire liv leaned against the railing in front of her and studied the field it seems simple enough she commented if this is third base here then thats first and second she gestured out they throw the ball the other guy smacks it and then runs around the bases before someone catches it a simplistic analysis of the thinking mans sport thorpe handed her the coke whats there to think about she asked before she sipped strike zones batting averages forceouts double play balls switch hitters wind velocity eras batting lineup bull pen quality all right she stopped him in midstream maybe i do need that crash course have you ever seen a game thorpe leaned back with his beer snatches on the monitor during a sportscast she glanced around the stadium again the sun was bright and warm the air cool she could smell beer and roasted peanuts and hot dogs from somewhere behind them a man and woman were already arguing over the game that was yet to be played there was a feeling of involvement she had completely missed in her occasional glimpses of a ball game on the television screen this is a different perspective she studied the scoreboard its initials and numbers told her little so when does it start liv turned to face thorpe to find him studying her what is it the unblinking stare made her uncomfortable the distance she had planned on hadnt worked now she began to wonder if the casual friendliness she had decided upon would fare any better ive told you you have a fantastic face he returned easily you werent looking at my face liv countered you were looking into my head he smiled and ran a finger down her fringe of bangs a man should understand the woman hes going to marry her brows drew together thorpe her intended lecture was cut off by the blast from the organ and the roar of the crowd opening ceremonies thorpe told her and draped his arm behind her chair liv subsided just humor him she cautioned herself the man is obviously unstable she settled back to watch the hoopla of the seasons start by the end of the first inning liv was lost and completely fascinated no one got any points she complained and crunched a piece of ice between her teeth thorpe lit a cigarette best game ive ever seen was in la dodgers and reds twelve innings one to nothing dodgers one point in twelve innings liv lifted a brow as the next batter stepped into the box they must have been lousy teams thorpe glanced at her a moment saw she was perfectly serious then burst out laughing ill buy you a hot dog carmichael the batter dropped a short single into left field and she grabbed thorpes arm oh look he hit one thats the wrong team liv thorpe pointed out wryly were rooting for the other guys she accepted the hot dog and peeled off a corner on the packet of mustard why why he repeated watching as she squeezed the mustard on generously the orioles are from baltimore the red sox are from boston i like boston liv took a healthy bite of the hot dog as palmer whipped a mean curve by the next batter shouldnt he have swung at that one dont like boston too loudly in this section thorpe advised the crowd roared as the batter grounded into a double play why didnt the man on first just stay where he was she demanded gesturing with her hot dog thorpe kissed her surprising her with a full mouth i think its time for that crash course by the bottom of the fifth liv was catching on to the basics shed taken to leaning over the rail as if to get a closer view the score was tied at three to three and she was too involved to be surprised her adrenaline was pumping in her excitement she had forgotten thorpe was a lunatic her shield was slipping so if they catch the ball in foul territory before it hits the ground its still an out you catch on fast dont be a smart aleck thorpe why are they changing pitchers because hes given up two runs this inning and hes behind on this batter hes lost his stuff she leaned her chin on the rail as the relief pitcher took the mound to warm up what stuff his speed his rhythm he liked the way she was absorbed in what was happening on the field he isnt getting his changeup over and his slider isnt working she gave thorpe a narrow look are you trying to confuse me absolutely not how long have you been coming to games my mother took me to my first when i was five washington had the senators then washington still has plenty of senators they were a ball team liv oh again she rested her chin on the rail he grinned at her profile your mother took you i would have thought baseball a fatherson sort of thing my father wasnt around he wasnt much on kids and responsibilities im sorry she turned her head to look at him i didnt mean to pry its no secret he shrugged i wasnt traumatized my mother was a terrific lady liv looked out to the field again strange she mused she hadnt thought of thorpe as ever being a child with a family growing up she tried to picture it her vision of him had been limited to a tough hardline reporter with a gift for biting exposes thinking of him with a childhood perhaps a difficult one altered the view there were entirely too many facets of him she had to remind herself she didnt want to explore them but what had he been like as a boy how much had the early years influenced the way he was today there was sensitivity in him the rose the damn rose liv thought of it with a sigh it made it difficult to remember that distance was necessary and his sexuality he knew how to arouse a woman even a reluctant one arrogance yes but he was so blatantly at ease with it the trait was somehow admirable and his skill in his profession couldnt be faulted she couldnt term him power or money hungry not when he had casually refused a position most reporters would slit throats for id better be careful she decided im dangerously close to liking him thorpe watched her profile observing the play of emotions over her face when she forgot her guards he reflected she was clear as glass what are you thinking he murmured and cupped the back of her neck with his hand no comment liv returned but couldnt bring herself to discourage the familiarity she couldnt find the will to push it away look theyre ready to start again the counts still three and one thorpe explained the runner on seconds charged to the first pitcher if he scores it goes against him not the relief that seems fair liv commented as the batter knocked a foul tip straight at her in automatic reflex she reached up to protect her face and snagged the ball as she looked down at it stunned the impact stung her palms nice catch thorpe congratulated grinning at her astonished face i caught it she said in sudden realization then gripped the ball tighter do i have to give it back its all yours carmichael she turned it over rather pleased with herself how about that she murmured then suddenly giggled it was the first time he had heard the young carefree sound from her it made her seem seventeen he had to check the urge to pull her against him and just hold her she had never appealed to him more than she did at that moment with the sun full on her face and a baseball clutched in her hands love for her was abruptly and unexpectedly painful he lost track of the game it was liv whose head shot up at the hard crack of ball on bat her eyes grew wide as she jumped from her seat with the rest of the stadium she grabbed thorpes arm dragging him with her oh look its going all the way over the fence thats a home run isnt it a home run thorpe yeah he watched the ball drop over the green barricade home run first one of the year oh it was beautiful she was caught in the loud blast of celebration music the cheers of the crowd liv turned giving thorpe a quick spontaneous kiss it was over before she could be surprised by her own action but he pulled her back for a deeper lingering one the shouts went on around her lost in the fast rocketing beat of her heart she gave him pressure for pressure taste for taste could be thorpe murmured as he drew his lips an inch from hers therell be a whole volley of long balls breathless liv eased out of his arms in them she lost everything but need i think ones enough she managed because her legs werent as steady as they might have been she sat back down she was closer to the edge than she had realized it was time to take a few steps back are you going to buy me another hot dog she demanded and smiled at him she ignored the tingling that still brushed along her skin im starving the rest of the game was a shrewd defensive battle liv had difficulty keeping her attention focused she was too aware of thorpe too aware of the pulsing needs he had aroused could arouse so easily she saw his hands and was reminded of the rough palms she saw his arms and remembered there were muscles that could make her feel soft and safe liv didnt want to be soft it made it too easy to be hurt she didnt want to rely on anyone for safety again it was too easy to be disappointed she saw his mouth and knew how well it seduced she told herself that to be seduced was to be weak and vulnerable his eyes were intelligent shrewd saw too much the more he saw the greater the risk that he could gain an emotional hold on her she had allowed herself to be involved before she still bore the scars for years she had lived on the belief that the only way for her to keep her serenity was by withdrawal she was coming to realize that thorpe could change this for the first time she understood that she was afraid of him of what he could come to mean to her friendship she reminded herself that was all there was going to be just simple friendship she spent the last two innings convincing herself it was possible so we won liv checked out the final score on the board five to three she rubbed the foul ball between both palms its we now huh thorpe grinned and tugged on her hair i thought you liked boston liv leaned back in her seat and propped her feet on the rail as the crowd began to file out of the stands that was before i understood the intricacies of the game you know its amazing how deceptive television can be its faster more intense than i thought do you come often he watched as she passed the ball from hand to hand and studied the field are you fishing just a casual question thorpe she said coolly whenever i can he answered still smiling ill take you to a night game next it has a whole different feel i didnt say tc they both looked up as a man worked his way through the aisles toward them he was short and stocky with stone gray hair and a livedin face it was lined and pitted with a square jaw and crooked nose thorpe rose to accept a bear hug boss how are you cant complain no cant complain he drew back far enough to study thorpes face good god you look good boy with a meaty hand he slapped thorpe on the back still watch you every night on the tv giving those politicians hell you always were a sassy young pup liv remained seated and watched the exchange in silence she was fascinated to hear thorpe referred to as a boy and a young pup thorpe was a good half foot taller than the man who grinned up at him someone has to keep them straight right boss you bet your boss stopped himself and glanced down at liv he cleared his throat gonna introduce me to your lady or are you afraid ill steal her away from you liv this old schemer is boss kawaoski the best catcher ever to harass an umpire boss olivia carmichael why sure livs hand was captured in the gnarled broad one the lady on the news youre even prettier face to face thank you he was beaming at her out of eyes that seemed a trifle myopic careful liv thorpe slipped an arm around her shoulder boss has a reputation as a ladykiller ah sh he cleared his throat quickly again and liv struggled with a grin shoot he modified wouldnt do to have my missus hear you talk that way whatd you think of the game tc palmers still dishing it out he pulled out a cigarette and lit it it looks like the birds have a tight team this year lots of new blood boss added glancing wistfully out at the field the young left fielder has a mean bat so did you boss thorpe looked back at liv boss carried a average the year he retired not completely certain of the meaning liv tried a safer angle did you play for the orioles mr kawaoski just boss miss i played for the senators that was twenty years ago he shook his head at the passage of time this one used to hang around the clubhouse making a nuisance of himself jerking a thumb at thorpe he grinned wanted to be a third baseman in those days did he liv gave thorpe a thoughtful look somehow she had never considered him wanting to be anything but what he was wasnt so good with a bat boss reminisced but he had a great pair of hands i still do thorpe said dryly and gave liv a broad smile which she ignored how are things going at the store boss just fine my wifes running it today she didnt want me to miss opening game he ran a hand along his squared chin cant say i argued with her much shell be sorry she missed you alice still lights a candle for you every sunday give her my best thorpe crushed the cigarette under his heel this is livs first game well no fooling bosss attention was switched as thorpe had intended liv noted the move and filed it boss glanced at the baseball still clutched in her hand caught yourself a foul too first time out beginners luck she admitted and held it out to him would you sign it for me ive never met a real ballplayer before slowly boss turned the ball over in his hand been a long time since i put my name on one of these he took the pen liv offered a long time he repeated softly he signed his name carefully around the curve of the ball thank you boss liv took the ball back from him thank you almost makes me feel like i could still pick a man off of second ill tell alice i saw you he gave thorpe a final thump on the shoulder and the pretty news lady he added come by the store first chance i get boss thorpe watched him move through the thinning crowd and up the steps that was a very nice thing you did he murmured to liv youre a perceptive woman liv glanced down at the signature on the ball it must be hard to give up a career a way of life thirty years before most people have to was he very good better than some thorpe shrugged that hardly matters he loved the game and the playing of it sweepers were already pushing their brooms through the narrow aisles and thorpe took her arm to lead her up the steps all the kids loved him he never minded being hounded or catching a few pitches after a game why does his wife light a candle for you on sundays she had told herself she wouldnt ask that it was none of her business the words were out before she could prevent them shes catholic liv let that pass a moment as they walked toward the parking lot dont you want to tell me she asked at length he jingled the keys impatiently in his pocket then drew them out they run a small independent sporting goods store in northeast a few years ago they were having some trouble inflation taxes the building needed some repairs he unlocked livs side of the door but she didnt get in only stood and watched him and twenty years ago ballplayers average ballplayers like boss didnt make a lot of money he didnt have much saved i see liv slipped into the car as thorpe rounded the hood leaning over she unlocked the handle for him so you lent him money i made an investment thorpe corrected as he shut the door i didnt offer a loan liv watched him as he started the ignition she could see he didnt like her touching on this aspect of his life she persisted it was simply a reporters habit she told herself to press for details because you knew he wouldnt accept a loan or that if he did it would put a dent in his pride thorpe let the car idle and turned to her thats a lot of supposition on a very brief encounter you just told me i was perceptive she pointed out whats the matter thorpe a smile tugged at her mouth dont you like people finding out you can be a nice guy then youre expected to be nice he told her i dont make a habit of it oh yes she was still amused and the smile grew your image tough unsentimental pragmatic he kissed her firmly impatiently her surprise spun into longing she felt his fingers tighten on her skin and she opened for him if it was a mistake she had to make it if it was madness shed find sanity later in that moment she only wanted to renew the pleasure he could give her his mouth was enough enough to satisfy the slowly growing hunger it wasnt the time to question why he was the one the only one who was able to crack the shield she had erected she wanted only to experience again to feel again his heart beat against hers lightly quickly making her understand the hunger was mutual she was wanted desired what would it be like to make love with him what would it be like to feel his skin against hers to have his hands touch her but no she couldnt let herself imagine she couldnt stop herself from imagining he let his lips wander to the crest of her cheekbone then on to her temple id like to continue this someplace more private i want to touch you liv his mouth came back to hers hot possessive all of you i dont want an audience he drew back until his eyes locked on hers he saw desire and his own clawed at him come home with me her heartbeat was echoing in her head fast and furious for the first time in years it would have been so simple to say yes she wanted him shockingly it overwhelmed her how had it happened so quickly if someone had suggested a month before that she would be tempted to make love with thorpe she would have laughed now it didnt seem ludicrous at all it seemed natural it frightened her liv drew out of his arms and ran a hand through her hair she needed some room some time no no im not ready for this she told herself to take a deep breath and did so carefully thorpe you make me nervous good he fought back a powerful surge of need and leaned back i wouldnt want to bore you she managed a husky laugh you dont bore me i dont know exactly what my feelings are toward you im not even sure youre quite stable this this delusion you have about getting married im going to remind you of this conversation on our first anniversary he put the car in first if he was driving he might keep himself from touching her again thorpe was discovering he wasnt as patient as he had thought thorpe thats ridiculous think of what its going to do for the ratings she wondered how he could be likable one minute desirable the next and then infuriating liv was torn between laughing and beating her head against the windshield in frustration okay thorpe she began opting for patience as he joined a stream of traffic im going to make this crystal clear in the simplest terms i can i am not going to marry you ever wanna bet he countered smoothly he shot her a grin ive got fifty says you will do you seriously expect me to bet on something like that no sporting blood he shook his head im disappointed carmichael liv narrowed her eyes make it a hundred thorpe ill give you twotoone odds he grinned again and cruised through a yellow light youre on chapter contents prev next prime minister summerfields death was unexpected the fatal stroke which ended the british officials life left his country saddened it sent the world press into a fever of preparation there were special reports to air recaps of summerfields fortyyear career in british government to assemble reactions to gather from the heads of other countries how would the death of one man affect the balance of power in the world two days after the prime ministers death was announced the president was in air force one crossing the atlantic to attend the funeral thorpe was with him as press reporter it would be his job to stick by the president as close as a reporter was allowed then share his information with the other news people who took the same journey on the press plane he had a crew pooled from the networks ready to film any pertinent business on the flight the cameraman lighting and sound technicians were settled in the rear of the plane with their equipment close at hand their colleagues and backups were following on the press plane in the forward portion of air force one were the president first lady and their entourages secretaries secret service advisors the mood was subdued behind thorpe members of the pool crew played a quiet game of poker even the swearing was low key on most trips he would have joined them whiled away the hours with a few hands a few stories but he had a lot on his mind the job itself would keep him occupied on the plane ride he had research and information to put together and pick apart a loose script to outline for the day of the funeral then in london it would be up to him to keep close to the president watch for reactions wait for a quote the desire to be in the field and report his own stories had been the major element in his refusal of the anchor job in new york thorpe would take what tidbits he could glean from the press secretary and use his own talents for observation and assimilation not only to give his own report but to feed information to his colleagues though the assignment was a plum he almost wished it had been handed to carlyle or dickson correspondents from the competing networks he was on air force one liv was on the press plane she had kept her distance from him during the past few days and thorpe had given her room hed had little choice with the pressures of a top news story taking up his time yet the same story had brought them both with frustrating consistency to the same locations shed been cool he recalled each time they had run into each other at the white house gates at the capitol at the british embassy there had been no hint of the woman he had seen eating hot dogs and cheering over a home run the ease with which she distanced him was more frustrating than he liked to admit even to himself impatience was dangerous he knew but his was growing she wasnt indifferent to him he thought as he scowled out of the window a bit of turbulence made the plane tremble slightly as he pulled out a cigarette no matter what she said or how she acted she couldnt erase the way she responded to him there was hunger and no matter how she struggled against it the hunger won whenever he held her in his arms thorpe was willing to settle for that for now three kings thorpe heard the muttered expletive from the seat behind him hey tc let me deal you in before this guy cleans us all out as he started to agree thorpe saw the president slip inside his office with his secretary and speech writer later he said absently and rose when was the last time i went to england liv wondered as she thought back she remembered the summer she had been sixteen she had traveled with her parents and her sister in first class she had been allowed to nibble caviar and melinda had been given champagne the trip had been melindas eighteenth birthday present liv remembered how her sister had chattered endlessly about the parties she would go to the balls the teas the theaters clothes had been discussed unceasingly until her father had buried himself behind a copy of the wall street journal too young for balls ambivalent about dresses liv had been bored to distraction the caviar an unwise sampling of her sisters champagne and air turbulence had proven an unfortunate combination shed been ill to her sisters disgust her mothers surprise and her fathers impatience for the rest of the journey she had been looked after by a flight attendant twelve years ago liv thought with a sigh things had certainly changed no champagne and caviar on this trip unlike air force one the press plane was both crowded and noisy the card games here were less restrained reporters and crew from washington stations roamed up and down the aisles gambled argued slept finding ways to ease the tedium of a long plane flight still there was an air of anticipation of energy the big story liv busied herself with working on notes while two correspondents across the aisle speculated on the political ramifications of summerfields death hed been a reserved almost bookish member of britains conservative party yet underneath liv mused as she scribbled down her thoughts thered been a fine edge of steel he hadnt been a man to be tampered with or intimidated by tricky diplomatic maneuvers she made notations on three potentially volatile situations he had handled during his term as prime minister and other legislative triumphs small and large during his government career liv had done quite a bit of research during the past two days boning up on parliamentary procedure and summerfield in particular she had needed a firm handle on british politics in order to convince carl to send her on the story his argument that washington politics were her forte had been only the first stumbling block thorpe as usual had been a larger one pressing down hard on her pencil with this thought liv snapped off the point thorpe was going to england thorpe had been assigned as the presidents press reporter thorpe would be traveling on air force one with the presidential entourage and the crew pooled from the various networks wwbw could use thorpes feed without dipping into the budget for the funds to send a reporter and crew of their own it had taken liv an hour of calm lucid reasoning and a further hour of determined arguing to change carls mind afterward she had been torn between cheering or screaming in frustration thorpe whatever she did wherever she went he was always there to make things twice as difficult for her and not just professionally she couldnt stop thinking about him during the day with the countless pressures of the job he would crop up either in person or by name then she would remember the dance at the embassy the embrace on the terrace the laughter at the ball game at night when she was alone he would invade her mind sneak into her thoughts no matter what liv did to prevent it he would just suddenly be there the way he laughed the ironic lift of brow the hard rough hands and worse much worse there were times she was certain she could taste his mouth on hers thats when the needs would grow out of nowhere unexpected vibrant she was never certain whether to be angry or terrified he had no right to bother her this way she thought furiously as she groped in her briefcase for another pencil he had no right to upset the order of her life and that bet liv closed her eyes on a sigh of frustration how had she ever allowed him to annoy her into making that ridiculous bet marriage could he possibly be unbalanced enough to think she would seriously consider marriage with him what sort of man would waltz up to a woman he knows can barely tolerate his presence and announce his intention to marry her a foolish one liv decided with a shrug then caught her bottom lip between her teeth or a very shrewd one uncomfortably liv felt tc thorpe fell into the latter category of course it didnt matter how shrewd he was he couldnt trick her into marriage and she would never be talked into it so she was perfectly safe liv stared down at her notes and wondered why she didnt feel that way mike thorpe slipped into the seat beside press secretary donaldson tc donaldson closed a file folder and gave thorpe a careful smile he was a man who looked like someones kindly uncle a little plump beginning to go bald his mind however was sharp and disciplined what have you got to give me thorpe asked him and settled himself comfortably donaldson raised both brows whats there to give he countered a state funeral condolences support some pomp and ceremony youll have a lot of top officials past and present rubbing elbows royalty too good copy tc he reached in his pocket for his pipe then slowly began to pack it therell be plenty to fill your time for the next couple of days youve got the presidents itinerary thorpe watched donaldson push tobacco into the bowl with his thumb hes going to be busy hes not going to london to sightsee donaldson said dryly none of us are mike thorpe reminded him all of us have our jobs i wouldnt want to think you were making mine tougher by holding back on me holding back tc donaldson gave a quick laugh even if i did you usually manage to ferret out enough to get by i notice theres a couple extra secret service aboard thorpe put in casually donaldson went right on filling his pipe first ladys aboard too i counted her men too thorpe waited a moment before going on the funeral of a man like summerfield brings diplomats from all over the world he paused accepting coffee from the flight attendant while donaldson eyed him over a lighted match representatives from every country in the un and a few more it promises to be quite a turnout depressing business funerals donaldson commented mmm depressing thorpe agreed and dangerous all right tc weve known each other too long what are you fishing for vibrations thorpe told him with a cool smile any vibrations of trouble donaldson any reason the president or any of those other high political officials should be extra careful paying their last respects what makes you think so donaldson countered an itch thorpe said amiably youd better scratch it tc donaldson advised ive got nothing for you as if considering the matter thorpe sipped his coffee summerfield wasnt popular with the ira donaldson gave a dry chuckle or the plo or a dozen other radical organizations is that a news bulletin tc just a comment can i get a statement from the president pertaining to what his views on summerfields policy with the irish republican army and thoughts on the new prime minister the presidents views on the ira are already documented donaldson chewed on the stem of his pipe lets get summerfield buried before we start on the new pm he shot thorpe a straight look it might not be wise to talk about your hunch tc no use giving people ideas is there i only give people the facts thorpe said carefully and rose i want to get some film donaldson pondered a moment ill arrange it but no sound were going to a funeral lets keep this low key my thoughts exactly youll let me know if there are any changes without waiting for an answer thorpe wandered back to the card game i want some film as soon as donaldson clears it he instructed the crew glancing down he noted the cameraman held two pair silent he told the sound technician you can relax get a shot of the first lady working on her needlepoint he grinned as the cameraman raised the bet looking for the homey touch tc thats right leaning closer he lowered his voice and see if you can get in a pan of the secret service the cameraman cocked his head to shoot thorpe a look and met the cool stare okay call the lighting technician tossed in his chips what dya got youre so proud of just a pair of eights the cameraman said with a smirk and a pair of queens full house the lighting technician spread his cards thorpe went back to his seat with mumbled curses following him he had always had an uncanny sense of intuition the few moments with the press secretary had sharpened it there was definitely more security on this trip than usual enough to alert thorpe terrorism was a common word in the world today it didnt take heavy thinking to conclude that when you brought heads of state from all over the globe together political violence was more than a remote possibility a bomb threat an assassination attempt a kidnapping thorpe studied the quiet threepiecesuited secret service agents theyd be on the lookout and so would he it would be a long three days and the nights he wondered after the presidents safely tucked away out of the reach of the press he and liv would stay at the same hotel with luck and a little strategy he added thoughtfully he could arrange to keep her close for most of the trip at the moment thorpe considered proximity his biggest asset proximity he amended and determination restless liv set aside her notes she was unable to concentrate she could not get thorpe off her mind it didnt help to be aware of how often they were going to be thrown together on this assignment at least in washington there were a number of stories to cover in the course of a day this time there would be only one and thorpe had the upper hand if she wanted a concise thorough report she would have to take whatever information he would give her she would have to meet and talk with him on a scheduled basis of course she reminded herself regardless of everything else he was a professional that she couldnt fault him for the information would be clear and incisive if only it didnt have to come from him kicking back her seat liv shut her eyes why was it her luck that thorpe had been chosen as press reporter if circumstances had been different she would soon be three thousand miles away from him though she didnt like admitting it she needed the distance there had to be a way to stay clear of him for the next couple of days she would have to be on her toes just to keep up with the story and all the angles hed be busy too that should solve a great deal of the problem when it came to free time liv decided she would make herself scarce he was too thick skinned to respect her refusals or her coolness if a no or a cold shoulder didnt work unavailability was the next step it was a pity they had to share the same hotel nothing can be done about that she reminded herself but she could see to it that she spent very little time in her room and very little time alone it should be simple enough to lose herself in the crowd of press people that were about to descend on london with a small sound of disgust she shifted in her chair she didnt like playing hideandseek but its not a game she told herself its more like war a war she forgot to fight when he got too close yearnings yes she felt yearnings when he held her when his mouth shaking her head she pushed the seat straight up it wasnt thorpe she insisted silently it was simply time she started feeling again five years was a long time to bury yourself clearly too clearly she saw his face in her minds eye and his smile the charming selfassured smile she was definitely going to keep her distance the landing was smooth thorpe had had to stick to the president for another two hours before he could set off for his hotel he had film plenty of film to feed back to the states along with his commentary as he checked his watch and adjusted for the time difference he noted cnc would have his report for the evening broadcast with a revamp and update at eleven hed done his job for the day he watched london whiz by it had been a good many years since hed been there six he mused no seven but he thought he could still find the pub in soho where he had interviewed a nervous attaché from the american embassy then there had been that little gallery in the west end where he had met a fledgling artist with a rubenesque body and a voice like thick cream fleetingly he recalled the two very exhilarating nights they had spent together seven years ago he thought before he had settled in washington before liv this london assignment was going to be different he wasnt interested in two exhilarating nights with an unknown woman he wanted a lifetime and one woman liv stepping out of the cab thorpe hefted his bag himself hed learned long ago to travel light there was a damp chill in the air the result of a drizzle which had stopped only moments before people on the sidewalk were hunched inside jackets and moving quickly as he stepped inside the hotel lobby thorpe saw the crowd of reporters checking in his hopes to get to his room for a shower before the briefing were immediately aborted thorpe shifting his bag he smiled at liv she nodded politely what have they got set up for us he asked and was told there was a temporary press room on the second floor okay lets head up and ill brief you before liv could lose herself in the crowd he had her arm how was your flight uneventful knowing she could hardly snatch her arm from his without causing comment liv answered casually and yours long he grinned at her as they squeezed into the elevator i missed you stop it thorpe she said crisply stop missing you id be glad to if youd stop avoiding me i havent been avoiding you ive been busy the crush in the elevator had her pressed tight to his side after shifting his bag to his other hand thorpe slid an arm around her shoulders crowded in here he said amiably when she shot him a narrow glance above the smells of tobacco old cologne and light sweat her scent lifted sweet and clean he had to control a desire to bury his face in her hair and lose himself in it youll make a scene wont you she said softly under the hum of conversation if youd like me to he agreed i want to kiss you liv he whispered bending close to her ear right here right now dont there was no room to push away from him she could only look up and glare it was her first mistake his mouth was inches from hers his eyes calmly amused stared back into hers there was a surge of need a devastating sexual pull her mind went blank when the elevator doors opened people began to file out around them liv stood still trapped not by the arm around her shoulders but by the look of quiet patient knowledge in his eyes come on tc lets get this show on the road thorpe didnt answer he smiled at liv and led her into the corridor well have to save it for later he told her freed of the trance liv stepped out of his reach there is no later she snapped then cursed herself as she took a place in the press room it took thorpe less than thirty minutes to brief his colleagues and send them rushing off to complete their own reports when he finally reached his own room he had put in a twentyhour day heading for the shower he stripped on the way liv walked into her room and let the bellboy bring in her bags she waited while he fussed around the room opening drapes checking the towel count what she wanted was a pot of tea from room service and her bed jet lag she thought wearily as she stuffed a pound note into the bellboys hand why was it her sister never suffered from it no matter how many times she zipped here or there country to country party to party if she had been melinda she would never have settled down with a cup of tea and a quiet room she would have changed and rushed out to take in londons night life but she wasnt melinda liv reminded herself as she slipped out of her suit jacket and she had already crammed a day and a half into a scant twentyfour hours tomorrow liv mused stepping out of her shoes there wouldnt be a moments rest glancing in the mirror she spotted the faint shadows of fatigue it wouldnt do to have them show up on camera a cup of tea then a quick glance at her notes before sleep she decided she was heading for the phone to order when she heard the knock on the connecting door she frowned at it then gave a sigh of annoyance if one of the other reporters wanted to party or discuss the angles of the summerfield story she wasnt interested who is it just another member of the working press carmichael thorpe the word came out in a rush of indignation without thinking she flicked the lock and opened the door he was leaning against the jamb smiling dressed only in a worn terry cloth robe his hair was still damp from his shower and the scent of soap and shaving lotion clung to him what are you doing here she demanded reporting the news he said soberly its my job you know very well what i mean she tossed back between her teeth what are you doing in the room next to mine the luck of the draw he ventured how much did you give the desk clerk to arrange it he grinned liv i dont have to respond to a leading question youll have to get that corroborated and ask me again still grinning he let his eyes roam down to her stocking feet going out no i am not liv folded her arms and prepared to deliver a heated setdown good id prefer a cozy evening at home he took a step into her room livs hand shot up to his chest now look thorpe her palm had connected with his naked chest where the robe crossed over and the sudden movement spread the material farther apart little more than dark springy hair covered him to his waist he continued to smile unabashed when she dropped her hand youre insufferable i do my best lifting his hand he twined a lock of her hair around his finger if youd rather go out he began i am not going out she repeated furiously and theres not going to be any cozy evening either i want you to understand havent you ever heard that colleagues on foreign soil have to stick together his grin was suddenly boyish and impossible to resist liv struggled to keep her lips in a straight line im making an exception in your case thorpe she added on a note of exasperation why wont you leave me alone liv it isnt traditional for a man to leave his fiancée alone his tone was so reasonable it took her a full ten seconds to react fiancée i am not your fiancée she shouted at him i am not going to marry you you want to add another hundred to the bet no she poked her finger into his chest now you listen to me thorpe your delusions are your own business leave me out of them im not interested you might be he said pleasantly some of my delusions are really fascinating and im not going to sleep next door to a lunatic im getting another room with that she whirled away afraid he asked following her as she snatched up her bag afraid liv tossed the bag back down and spun back the day im afraid of you i was thinking more of yourself he tilted his head and studied her furious face maybe youre not sure you could resist ah tapping on my door speechless liv stared at him tapping she managed in a sputter you think you think i find you so irresistible so so desirable he suggested helpfully liv clenched her hands into fists i dont have any trouble resisting you thorpe no before she could take a breath she was in his arms before she could think to protest his mouth was on hers pressed close so close her body seemed to mold itself to his without her will his mouth was firm not impatient so much as insistent this time rather than tempting her surrender he demanded it the control though it balanced on a fine edge was his with his fingers in her hair he pulled her head back and plundered deeper and still deeper no trouble liv he murmured lifting his mouth a whisper from hers her breath was trembling she shook her head before she attempted to speak but he gave her no chance again his lips took hers this time with the fire of possession a moan of pleasure escaped her as she instinctively reached for him tangling her fingers in his damp hair to pull him closer sharp small needs began to race along her skin he seemed to know for his hands followed them with uncanny accuracy a fingertip down her spine a thumb at the sweep of her hip his palm at the long length of her thigh liv explored his face with her own hands running her fingers over the angles and planes as if she would sculpt it her touch only heightened his demand so that he crushed her to him bending her back from the waist like putty she moved to his command then he molded her under his hands her breasts rose and fell with her quickened breathing the nipples were taut straining against the material of her blouse while he circled a fingertip over them there was no thought of resistance she wanted the burn of his mouth the scorch of his touch when his lips moved to her throat she tilted her head to give him absolute freedom the moist heat of his tongue on her skin sent ripples of pleasure through her she was lost in the dim shadowed world of desires his naked chest was pressed hard against her breasts caught tight with arms that wrapped possessively around her liv yielded to him to her own desire his mouth lingered at the curve of her neck just above the collar of her blouse then with deliberate leisure he took his lips upward lingering at the pulse in her throat then the line of her jaw when his mouth came back to hers it was as though all the hunger and thirst she had ever known were concentrated in that one touch of lips passion went from dark to bright a harsh blinding light seemed to explode in her brain it left her limp with a muffled cry that was half surrender half terror liv leaned against him unprepared for the sudden weakness thorpe drew her away to study her in her eyes he could see traces of desire hints of fear and confusion the eyes alone were a more impenetrable defense than all her angry words or fierce denials tenderness he couldnt fight his own surge of tenderness taking her now would be simple but having her physically was only part of what he wanted when they finally made love and he had no doubt that they would she would come to him without fear he would wait for it smiling he touched his lips briefly to hers he wanted to see the flash of temper again in case you change your mind about resisting me carmichael ill leave my door unlocked you dont even have to knock he sauntered away shutting his connecting door with a gentle click it took ten seconds before the heavy thud of her thrown shoe sounded against it with a grin thorpe switched on the television to see what the british news had to offer chapter contents prev next with a low monotonous buzz the alarm woke liv at six am she reached for the button automatically then lay staring at the bland impersonal room without the least idea where she was london she remembered and rubbed her fingers over her eyes she hadnt slept well sitting up liv brought her knees to her chest and rested her forehead on them blast thorpe shed spent half the night tossing and turning with doubts and desires that hadnt existed before he had touched her her purpose for being in london was professional even if she had the time she didnt have the inclination for anything else she simply didnt want to be involved with him why couldnt he see that because she thought wearily saying something and acting on it are two different things how could she convince him she didnt want to be involved when she responded totally every time he took her into his arms yes she had wanted him in that flash of a moment when she had been held close mouth on mouth she would have given herself to him her will had bent to his that frightened her the problem as she saw it had to be resolved within herself first the most important thing to do was to change the wording not that she didnt want to be involved but that she refused to be involved rising liv prepared to shower and dress there was too much to do that day to sit and brood about a personal dilemma in any case she thought it gave thorpe too much importance to brood about him at all how he would enjoy knowing she had done just that she had packed a very somber suit charcoal gray and tailored after doing up the final button liv gave herself a quick professional study in the fulllength mirror she would do a dab of extra makeup concealed the faint shadows under her eyes thorpe again she thought resentfully the slim briefcase would carry her notes along with an extra pad and a supply of pencils tossing her coat over her arm she prepared to leave a slip of white on the floor by the connecting door caught her eye liv stared at it for a moment it looked suspiciously like a note the best thing to do she thought would be to ignore it she walked all the way to the front door before she gave up and went back stooping she scooped the paper up good morning that was all it said a laugh escaped her before she could stop it hes mad she decided again absolutely mad on impulse she ripped off a sheet of her own notepaper and scribbled a similar greeting after slipping it under the connecting door she left the room as arranged she found her crew in a corner of the hotels coffee shop hey liv bob sent her a quick smile want some breakfast just coffee she took the communal pot and poured i feel like i need a gallon of it its going to be a long day he reminded her and dug into his eggs starting immediately she agreed absently she shook her head at the waiter i want a standup in front of westminster abbey before the crowds get there and another at downing street with luck we might get some tape of summerfields widow i imagine theyll start lining the streets a good hour before the funeral procession is scheduled one of the crew tempted liv with a piece of toast but she smiled and shook her head well want some pans of the crowd on tape to use with a voiceover later ive got to pick up some souvenirs for my wife and kids bob shot liv a grin as she picked up her coffee look liv i got enough grief because i took off for london without them if i dont bring back a few goodies im going to be sleeping on the sofa you should be able to squeeze out a few minutes for shopping between setups she said as she spoke her eyes roamed the room skimming over the faces of other reporters looking for somebody bob asked and cut into a sausage what distracted she looked back at him youve been scanning the room since you sat down are you meeting someone else no she said annoyed that she had unconsciously been looking for thorpe you all better hurry she told the crew in general the schedules tight for the next ten minutes she drank her coffee with her back to the rest of the room the weak sunlight brought little warmth as liv stood across from westminster abbey she waited going over her notes for the standup one last time as the crew set up their equipment she estimated the spot would take fortyfive seconds behind her the abbeys towers rose into a murky sky london was gray under the clouds the air heavy with threatening rain at the moment she gave no thought to the city around her but was totally focused on the fortyfive seconds of tape that was to come come in on me she instructed the cameraman after the intro im going to turn to the side and gesture back at the abbey i want a slow pan then come back on me at the finish gotcha bob waited until his lighting man had rechecked his meter okay liv took the mike then nodded she ran through it once dissatisfied she ran through it a second time a faint breeze tugged at her hair as she spoke of the ceremony that was to come thoroughly as though she had not worked the timing to the second she talked of the abbeys history when the camera came back to her she looked into the lens with direct serious eyes this is olivia carmichael reporting from westminster abbey london well bob shifted his weight to his hip its a wrap she checked her watch all right we go to downing street therere two hours before the ceremonies start that should give us enough time for a quick standup and a few manonthestreets well want another briefing with thorpe before we feed what we have back to the station thorpe had time for three cups of coffee while he waited for the president his brief meeting with donaldson had disclosed only that the president had spent a comfortable evening and had arisen early but thorpe was not satisfied outside the limo waited with secret service hovering discreetly in the background thorpe drew on a cigarette standing coatless heedless of the chill spring morning his cameraman whistled tunelessly while the rest of the crew held a mumbled conversation thorpe didnt pay attention he was watching the secret service they were quite obviously on the alert the moment the president stepped outside things came to life thorpe heard the whirl of the camera going on he had the mike in his hand almost without thought he filed what the first lady was wearing there would be those who would demand an exact account mr president the president stopped by the door to the limo and turned to thorpe a brief nod kept the guards at arms length tc he said solemnly a sad day for england and for the world yes mr president do you feel prime minister summerfields death will have an effect on your foreign policy eric summerfields death will be felt keenly by all men of peace a roundabout way to say nothing thorpe thought without rancor it was the name of the game he also knew protocol he wouldnt be allowed hardline questions on the morning of the funeral mr president he added changing tactics have you any personal memories of the prime minister if he was surprised by the altered tone he continued smoothly he could walk for miles the president smiled i discovered that at camp david eric summerfield liked to think on his feet with that the president slipped into the limo beside his wife still vaguely dissatisfied thorpe waited for his press car his commentary and the film of the funeral procession would be broadcast via satellite thorpe set up less than a block away from westminster abbey where the service would be conducted his coverage promised to be a long involved dissertation on what dignitaries had come to pay their respects and in what order they arrived thorpe announced the sighting of the royal familys limo then others sprinkling in tidbits of summerfields career and personal life the streets were jammed with people yet the background noise was minimal when they spoke onlookers spoke in hushed tones as if they were inside the abbey he glimpsed liv once but there was no time for a personal encounter as he talked into the mike she was in the corner of his eye the corner of his mind his body tensed a split second before it happened a car broke through the police barricade and headed at high speed for the heart of the funeral procession there was the sudden shocking sound of gunfire people who had lined the streets to watch scattered in a melee of fear and confusion cameramen raced for a better shot at the scene mike in hand liv dashed forward reporting on the run thorpe was there ahead of her the procession was at a standstill bullets ripped holes in the tires of the speeding car sending it skidding careening out of control the windshield cracked in a spider web of lines as the car swerved held on course then swerved again it rammed into the curb and came to an abrupt halt four men leaped out rifles blazing bullets flew indiscriminately toward the cavalcade into the crowd there were screams and a new rush of panic people were knocked underfoot while others scrambled for safety liv pushed her way through dashing after her cameraman she had to shove and duck as she fought against the flow of the crowd which rushed pellmell in the opposite direction shots rang out over the shouts of anger and terror she took a sharp blow on the arm as someone clawed his way past her never faltering she continued forward speaking into her mike thorpe caught livs wrist as she started to brush by him pulling her back he kept his body firmly planted in front of hers hed seen a bullet smash into the pavement no more than three feet from where he stood dont be a damn fool he snapped before he lifted his mike again four men he continued without taking his eyes off the scene masked and armed with highpowered rifles liv jerked her wrist out of his hold because her way was blocked she was forced to give her report from where she stood over thorpes shoulder she could see the wrecked car and the gunmen there was no need to give bob instructions he was down on one knee at the front of the crowd taping the shooting as coolly as he would have taped a garden party from whatever cover they could find members of the world press did their job in a medley of languages the word of the attack went out over the airwaves an explosive blast of gunfire erupted then there was sudden and ominous silence thorpe continued to report after the four men lay sprawled in the street his voice was objective if hurried he had to give the facts as he saw them he had chosen television news for just this purpose the immediacy it would always be the newsmans greatest challenge to report accurately what was happening as it happened without a script without preparation his adrenaline was pumping his instincts had been right on target for the next fifteen minutes he talked nonstop until the crowd was calmed and the procession continued on to the abbey the service would go on inside the london correspondent for cnc would take over it would give thorpe time to dig up information on the attack he signed off and signaled his cameraman you had no right liv began immediately shut up olivia he hadnt realized until that moment just how furious he was as he turned his mike over to the sound technician his hand shook slightly she could have been killed he thought grimly standing right beside him she could have been killed incensed she drew herself up straight who do you think you are the furious question was cut off when he grabbed her arm somebody had to stop you before you ran out into the crossfire you damn idiot he stopped took her shoulders and shook her whod give your precious report if you walked into a bullet liv jerked away from him i had no intention of walking into a bullet i knew exactly what i was doing she said coldly you werent thinking about anything but getting on top of the action he was shouting now drawing the curious attention of a few of their colleagues did you think you could ask politely for them to stop shooting and give you an interview almost as bewildered as she was infuriated liv stared at him i dont know what youre talking about she said i didnt do anything any other reporter wouldnt have done with a quick move of her hand she pushed back her tousled hair it was exactly what you did yourself you had no business interfering with my work interfering with your work he repeated incredulously there were four crazy men with highpowered rifles out there damn it i know that exasperated she gestured with her mike thats the story whats the matter with you thorpe stared back at her he was overreacting and knew it but the fury wouldnt die to keep from shaking her again he jammed his hands into his pockets he wasnt able to deal with knowing she could be in any sort of danger and that he could do nothing about it ive got a story to cover he said tersely and left her there placing her fists on her hips liv glared after him glancing to the side she caught bobs questioning stare after blowing out a frustrated breath she went to him come on get the rest of the crew weve got a story to cover liv interviewed officials bystanders police she spoke to a pale shocked woman who had a flesh wound in her upper arm from a stray bullet liv had to lean heavily on crowd reaction and speculation as the facts were still very thin four unidentified men on what could be considered nothing less than a suicide mission twentyfour people had been injured more from crowd panic than from bullet wounds only six had to be hospitalized and only two of them had serious injuries liv dashed down names and occupations as she worked her way through the remaining crowd if the terrorists had counted on aborting the prime ministers funeral service they hadnt reckoned with british sangfroid the ceremony went on as scheduled inside the centuriesold abbey while the press and police functioned outside ambulances came and went along with official vehicles the wrecked car was towed away long before the service was over there was no sign of any disturbance on the street from her vantage point liv watched the royal family exit the abbey if the security had been tightened it remained discreet she waited until the last limo had driven off rubbing the bruise on her arm she watched camera crews breaking down their equipment shed been standing for hours what now bob asked her as he loaded his camera in its case scotland yard she said wearily and stretched arching her back i have a feeling were going to spend most of the afternoon waiting she couldnt have been more right with a pack of other reporters print and television she waited they were given a bare dribble of information in an official statement and sent on their way by six oclock that evening there was nothing to add to her report but a recap of the mornings events and a statement that the terrorists were as yet unidentified liv shot a final standup in front of scotland yard then headed back to the hotel exhausted she soaked for an hour in the tub and let the fatigue drain still when she had toweled off and slipped into her robe she was restless the room was too quiet too empty and she was still too keyed up from the events of the day she began to regret that she had turned down the crews offer to join them for dinner it was still early she noted too early she didnt want to face another night alone in a hotel room if she chose there were any number of reporters she could seek out for company over a drink or a meal but liv found she didnt want to spend her evening rehashing and speculating over the days events she wanted to see london forgetting her weariness she began to dress it was cool outside with the dampness that had threatened all day still lingering she had a light coat thrown over her slacks and sweater without thinking of direction she began to wander traffic clogged the streets so that the smell of exhaust tickled her nostrils she heard big ben strike eight if she was going to have dinner she should find a restaurant but she kept walking again she was reminded of the trip a dozen years before she had traveled in a rolls then from monument to monument there had been a garden party at buckingham palace in a pale rose organdy dress and picture hat melinda had curtsied to the queen liv remembered how badly she had wanted to visit the tower of london her mother had reminded her the national gallery would be more instructive she had studied the paintings dutifully and thought how badly she would have liked to have seen the inside of a pub once not so many years ago doug had spoken of taking a trip to london that had been in their college days when there had still been dreams they had never had the money to spare for the plane fare then there had been no love left to spare for dreams liv shook herself out of the mood she was here now free to see the tower of london or a pub or to ride the subway but there was no one to share the adventure with no one to liv with a gasp she turned and collided with thorpe he steadied her with a hand on her arm for a moment she stared at him completely disoriented alone he asked but didnt smile yes i she groped around for something to say yes i thought id do some sightseeing you looked a little lost after releasing her arm he stuck his hand in his pocket i was just thinking she began to walk again and he fell into step beside her have you been to london before once a long time ago have you in my salad days they walked for a time in silence the restraint she sensed in him was something new but she said nothing letting him choose his own time theres nothing new on the terrorists he told her after a moment yes i know i spent the afternoon at scotland yard i suppose they could have been independent thorpe shrugged they had very sophisticated very expensive equipment but they didnt seem to know how to use it they were the only fatalities it was stupid liv murmured thinking of the four men who had held the limelight for one brief fleeting moment a senseless thing to die for again they lapsed into silence walking in the chilly evening the streetlamps were lit they passed under the light into the shadows and back into the light abruptly he laid a hand on her shoulder liv there were a lot of bullets flying around out there today yes it was a miracle that none of the press or bystanders were killed yes she wasnt going to make it easy for him thorpe let out an impatient breath if i overreacted this morning it was because i stopped thinking about you as a reporter i only remembered you were a woman and i didnt want you hurt in silence she studied his face is that an apology she asked him no its an explanation liv considered for a moment all right all right what i consider it a reasonable explanation she smiled then but the next time you get in my way on a story youre going to get a very unladylike elbow in the ribs understood he nodded returning the smile understood have you had dinner thorpe she asked as they began to walk again no ive been getting the runaround from donaldson hungry he glanced down at her one brow lifted is that an invitation olivia no its a question answer yes or no yes someone told me that colleagues on foreign soil should stick together she commented what are your views on that i would be inclined to agree liv took his arm come on thorpe ill buy you dinner chapter contents prev next they found a noisy crowded chophouse and squeezed into a corner table thorpe glanced around at the line of customers packed together at the counter in the air was the scent of grilled meat and frying oil overhead were brilliant fluorescent lights very romantic he commented im a sucker for atmosphere on a date this isnt a date liv reminded him as she slipped out of her coat im testing a theory you should be careful not to spoil it spoil it he gave her an innocent stare how her only answer was a narrowed look when they had ordered liv settled back in her chair to soak up the atmosphere at the counter two men argued heatedly over a horse race over the hiss and sizzle of cooking meat was a constant buzz of conversation it was precisely the sort of place she had wanted to experience when she had been a teenager on her first trip to london in silence thorpe watched her noting that her eyes went from person to person with no loss of fascination gone was the faint sadness he had seen on her face when he had first met her on the street what had she been thinking about he wondered or was it whom there was still too much he didnt know and he thought it would still be some time before she told him what do you see he demanded london liv smiled back at him a lot more of london than you can see by looking at monuments and museums apparently you like what you see i only wish we werent due to leave in the morning id like another day what would you do with it liv lifted her shoulders oh see everything everyone ride a doubledecker bus eat fish and chips in a newspaper go to covent garden she shook her head ive been to covent garden id rather go to the docks thorpe laughed lifting his beer have you ever been to the london docks olivia no why i wouldnt advise it at least not alone youre forgetting im a reporter again she reminded him so would the dock workers he said dryly well she shrugged before leaning back in her chair in any case we go back tomorrow what are your plans then after i check in at the station im going to sleep for the rest of the weekend whens the last time you saw washington he asked as grilled pork chops were set in front of them what are you talking about i see washington every day i mean for fun he picked up his fork have you ever played tourist in dc liv frowned as she cut into the meat well i suppose ever been to the zoo of course i did a story on she paused and looked up he was grinning at her all right whats your point that you dont relax enough liv lifted a brow im relaxing now arent i she asked there isnt time for me to show you london properly thorpe put in why dont you let me show you washington warning signals sounded immediately liv toyed with her meal as she formulated a safe answer i dont think so she said carefully thorpe smiled and went on eating why not i dont want you to get the wrong idea thorpe whats the wrong idea his voice was bland and friendly glancing down at her hands he remembered how her fingers had moved over his face when he kissed her look liv paused wanting to choose her words carefully im not totally averse to your company but carmichael you slay me with compliments but she continued shooting him a look im not going to become involved with you and i dont want you to think otherwise because the words made her feel ungracious she unbent a little we can be friends of a kind i suppose of what kind thorpe she said impatiently stop it liv as a reporter i need concise information he gave her an easy smile before he sipped at his beer as a reporter she countered you should be intuitive enough to understand my meaning leaning closer he grinned im crazy about you carmichael youre crazy period she corrected and tried to ignore the sudden increase in her pulse rate but im trying to overlook that so that we can deal together amicably now if youd just agree to keep things on a friendly basis she continued whats your definition of friendly he inquired thorpe youre impossible liv im just trying to understand the issue if i dont have the facts straight how can i reach a viable conclusion now as i see it he took her hand youre willing to admit you can tolerate my company is that right liv drew her hand from his so far she said warily and youre willing to take the second step and be friends casual friends though she knew he was leading her she was as yet unable to see the trick casual friends he agreed lifting his beer he toasted her to the third step what third step liv demanded but he only smiled at her over the rim of his glass thorpe your dinners getting cold he warned then gave her pork chops an interested glance are you going to eat all that distracted from the point she had been going to make liv looked down at her plate why i missed lunch liv laughed and cut another slice so did i she told him she ate every bite when they stepped back outside it was raining lightly liv lifted her face to it she was glad thorpe had found her glad to have had his company over dinner if it didnt make sense it didnt matter if it wasnt safe she didnt care she had needed an evening with someone who could make her laugh make her think make her feel if it was thorpe she wasnt going to question why tonight a few stolen hours was all she wanted a few hours to forget all the promises she had once made herself she didnt need the promises tonight tonight she was free of the past free of the future what are you thinking thorpe turned her into his arms as she laughed that im glad its raining still laughing she shook back her hair then his mouth was on hers liv threw her arms around his neck and gave herself totally to the moment he hadnt meant to kiss her god he hadnt meant to he had only so much control to call upon but at that instant when she laughed and lifted her face to his he couldnt resist there was rain in her hair on her cheeks he could taste it on her lips he had never sensed this sort of abandonment in her before it fanned his desire to a consuming fire couldnt she see how much he loved how much he needed and have pity on him if nothing else dear god he thought as he devoured her willing mouth he was desperate enough to take pity if it was all she could give him crushing her to him thorpe buried his face against her throat liv stepped back drawing out of his arms to lean against a lamppost her heart was racing with a terrifying euphoria the speed and force of her own passion left her shaken and she had sensed something in him a desperation that she didnt dare accept thorpe i swallowing unable to admit what was happening to her she shook her head i didnt mean for that it just happened she finished helplessly still throbbing thorpe went to her liv he began lifting a hand to her cheek no please she closed her eyes there was a tugofwar inside her pulling toward him pulling away perhaps if she could forget everything wipe the slate clean until that moment then but no there was no pushing aside what had been she wasnt yet ready to start again i cant she whispered as she opened her eyes i just cant instead of taking his hand from her cheek he turned it over letting his knuckles brush along her skin it would have been impossible to have wanted her any more than he did at that moment cant he asked or wont i dont know she murmured what do you want liv tonight she lifted her hand to his just be my friend tonight thorpe there was a plea in her eyes that he couldnt ignore tonight liv he took her by the shoulders friends tonight but i wont make any promises about tomorrow fair enough some of the tension seeped out of her after a deep breath she smiled at him buy me a drink ive waited twelve years to see the inside of a london pub his hold slackened slowly she caught a glimmer of the effort it took for him to release her i know a little place in soho if its still there lets go see liv linked her arm through his it was there a bit more dingy than it had been seven years before when he entered thorpe wondered if it were the scent of the same stale beer and tobacco that hung in the air its perfect liv told him as she gazed around through the curtain of smoke lets get a table they found one in a corner liv sat with her back to the wall customers were shoulder to shoulder at the bar from the familiarity she concluded most of them were regulars off to the side someone played a piano with more enthusiasm than skill several voices joined in song there was talk a constant chatter a voice would lift now and then so that she caught snatches of conversation the theme ranged from the attack on the funeral procession to someones unsympathetic boss whatll ya ave the barmaid who sauntered over gave them both a suspicious stare white wine for the lady thorpe told her ill have a beer ooh americans that seemed to please her doing the town thats right thorpe told her with a quick laugh she walked back to the bar got us a couple americans jake she told the bartender lets ave some service liv gave a low laugh how did you know about this place thorpe i was on assignment a few years back he flicked his lighter at the end of a cigarette an american attached to our embassy here had delusions of being a master spy he picked this place for the meet cloak and dagger liv leaned forward resting her elbows on the wooden table and what came of it zilch oh come on thorpe disappointed liv shook her head at least make something up how about i infiltrated an international spy ring singlehandedly and broke the story on the six oclock news much better she approved here you go ducks the barmaid set the drinks in front of them just whistle when you want another round you know liv continued when they were alone again you just about fit the image image the tough unflappable newsman liv sipped at her wine before she grinned at him you know a trench coat with a few wrinkles the worldweary face you stand in front of a government building or a sordid pit and report the news in a drizzle it has to be drizzling i dont have a trench coat he pointed out dont spoil it even for you he said with a smile im not going to start doing standups in a trench coat im crushed im fascinated are you by what by your image of a field reporter it was my image before i got into the game she admitted i saw myself having meets with disreputable figures of the underworld in seamy bars and breaking worldshaking stories before breakfast it was going to be one fastpaced story after another adventure excitement intrigue no paperwork stakeouts or time editors drinking his beer he watched her how could anyone remain so lovely after the day she had put in her laugh was warm and appreciative thats it exactly reality came into focus in college but i think i still had this image of high adventure and glamour it stayed with me until i covered my first homicide she gave herself a quick shake and returned to her wine thats the sort of thing that brings you back to earth quickly do you ever get used to dealing with that thorpe you dont get used to it he countered but you deal with it she nodded then pushed away the mood the piano player had switched to a melancholy ballad are you really writing a novel did i say that over the rim of her glass she smiled you did whats it about political corruption naturally what about yours i dont have one with a spark of mischief in her eyes she looked up at him a dull throbbing ache started in his stomach actually she began in lowered tones then hesitated can you be trusted thorpe no she gave a muffled laugh of course not but ill tell you anyway off the record she added off the record he agreed when i was in college and money was scarce i did some writing on the side oh he wondered how money could have been scarce with her family background but left the question unasked what kind of writing i did a few pieces for my true story after choking on his beer he stared at her youre kidding the confession magazine dont get lofty i needed the money besides she added with a touch of pride they were pretty good little pieces really thorpe gave her a lewd grin fictional she stated id like to read them just for educational purposes not a chance she glanced up as the crowd at the bar grew noisier what did you do in your misspent youth thorpe i had a paper route he cast a casual glance over his shoulder at two men who were arguing over a game of darts ah always the journalist and chased girls that goes without saying liv watched the dart players come nose to nose over their disagreements customers at the bar began cheerfully choosing sides thorpe reached for his wallet were not leaving she asked as he pulled out bills things are going to get rowdy in a minute i know she grinned i want to watch do you want the guy in the hat or the one with the moustache liv he began patiently whens the last time you were in on a barroom brawl dont be stuffy thorpe im betting on the guy in the hat hes smaller but hes wiry even as she spoke the man with the moustache threw the first punch with a sigh of resignation thorpe leaned back shed be safer in the corner at this point those at the bar turned to watch holding their drinks as they shouted encouragement liv winced as her man took a jab in the stomach throughout the pub customers began to pull out bills as they wagered on the outcome the bartender continued to dry glasses the two men came together in a furious hug then toppled to the floor to wrestle thorpe watched them roll around on the floor a chair was knocked over and a man with a glass of ale set it upright sliding it out of range he settled on it to root for the man of his choice there were shouts of encouragement and advice it appeared livs prediction was a sound one thorpe decided the man with the hat was slippery as an eel he had his bigger adversary in a headlock demanding that he give with a face reddened with frustration and lack of air he did want another drink thorpe asked liv as things quieted down again hmm she brought her attention back to him then grinned at his dry expression thorpe dont you think this is the sort of thing that makes good copy if youre going to comment on a prizefight he agreed but smiled you surprise me olivia why because i didnt scream and cover my eyes laughing she signaled the waitress herself thorpe they didnt do any more than give themselves a few bruises and something to talk about the newsrooms more violent every day before deadline youre a tough lady carmichael he said toasting her pleased she touched her glass to his why thank you thorpe it was late when they walked back outside liv heard the hour strike one stubbornly the drizzle continued to fall lights reflected in shallow puddles and glimmered hazily through the misting rain though the air was chilled the wine had warmed liv so that she felt glowing and wide awake do you know she said as they walked slowly through soho the first time i was in london i went to monuments and museums teas and theaters i feel as though ive seen more tonight than i did in that entire week when he took her hand in his she made no objection there was something natural about walking with him in the early hours of the morning in a misting rain when i left the hotel tonight i was tired depressed she moved her shoulders restless im glad you found me i wanted to be with you he said simply cautiously liv skirted around his statement im glad were getting back in the middle of the weekend she continued an assignment like this drains you especially when you get a surprise like we had this morning not much of a surprise really he commented liv looked up sharply do you mean you were expecting something like that to happen lets say i had a hunch well you might have shared it with the rest of us she said with a sound of exasperation after all you were the press reporter and as such im required to share information and facts not hunches he grinned as she frowned up at him you should have been able to put two and two together for yourself carmichael you have raindrops on your lashes dont change the subject and every trace of your makeups been washed away thorpe your hairs wet with a sigh liv gave up tired he asked as they walked into the lobby of the hotel no she laughed lord knows i should be want to go to the lounge for a nightcap not if i want a clear head in the morning she headed for the elevator instead i have to check in with scotland yard before we leave any connections there you want to share thorpe smiling he pushed the button for their floor youll have to dig up your own i thought your turf was washington when im there he agreed and steered her into the corridor you do have a connection she said suspiciously i didnt say that in any case the london correspondent will take the story from here knowing she faced a dead end liv slipped her key into the lock thats unfortunately true i hate not being able to follow up on it she turned to smile at him thanks for the company without speaking he lifted her hand to his lips when the tremor shot down from her fingertips she started to pull away but he kept her hand firmly in his he turned her palm up to plant another lingering kiss thorpe liv backed away but her hand was still held fast in his we agreed to be friends his eyes were fixed on hers the husky quality of her voice stroked along his skin its tomorrow liv he said quietly i didnt make any promises about tomorrow putting his hands on her shoulders he turned her toward the door and pushed her gently in he let go of her only to close the door behind them she was in his arms again slowly he ran his fingertips up the slim column of her neck with his eyes on hers he traced the shape of her ear her cheekbones then her lips they trembled open at his touch as if she would speak but no words came with the same slow care he took his mouth on the journey his fingers had completed light butterfly kisses roamed over her neck and face teased her mouth he used neither pressure nor demand but let her own needs hold her prisoner when he slipped his hands under her sweater she made no attempt to stop him barely touching her he ran the back of his fingers up her sides then down again he felt her quiver still he deepened the kiss only slightly a gentle exploration of the moist recesses of her mouth a tender meeting of tongues liv didnt resist him it was as if she were too steeped in a conflict of her own making to reach for him or to push him away her breasts were firm and taut in his hands the rough scrape of his palm against her sensitive skin brought a moan of pleasure from her somehow instinct warned him she should be treated as an innocent with care with patience yet all the while his desire for her increased her trembling excited him but he needed more he needed her to touch him to ask for him the passion was there he had tasted it before he wanted it now his mouth pressed down on hers drawing it coaxing it she was fighting herself more than him her breathing was ragged her body pliant but there was still a thin wall he had not yet broken through slowly he unhooked her slacks and with a groan let his fingers reach for her soft the incredible softness of her took him to the edge of control for a moment she pressed against him convulsively life seemed to shoot into her entire body under his her mouth was suddenly avid and demanding then she was pulling away backing against the door she shook her head frantically no no dont do this liv pushed to the limit thorpe brought her back into his arms i wont hurt you what are you afraid of it was too close much too close her voice sharpened in defense im not afraid of anything i want you to go i want you to leave me alone with his temper straining his grip on her tightened the hell you do his mouth came down hard on hers as fury and frustration seeped through even as she tried to protest her lips were answering his now look at me he demanded roughly drawing her back by the shoulders look at me and tell me you dont want me she opened her mouth to tell him but the lie wouldnt come she could only stand and stare at him all of her courage deserted her she was totally without defense damn you liv thorpe muttered abruptly pushing her aside he slammed out of the door chapter contents prev next when liv walked into wwbw on monday morning her thoughts were calm she had spent the remainder of her weekend assessing her relationship with thorpe relationship was not quite the word she liked to use it implied something personal situation was a better choice she had firmly decided against complications it was true that she had found him more appealing more enjoyable than she had thought she would more fun she had never considered thorpe in the context of fun he was an entertaining companion and there was a quiet streak of kindness in him which softened her liv was a cautious woman circumstances had made her so but she was honest with herself she knew the cool controlled olivia carmichael who delivered the fivethirty news was only part of the whole woman a great deal of herself had been in storage she had put it there for her own survival it was true that thorpe had begun to pick the lock but the years had given her strength if she wanted to keep herself shut off she would it was that simple or so she had convinced herself involvement didnt always follow a physical attraction she had no intention of becoming involved with thorpe they would still work closely now and again and perhaps she would even consider seeing him socially on occasion perhaps it was time to start picking up the pieces of her personal life she couldnt mourn forever but she would not put herself into a position again where things could get out of hand with thorpe he wasnt a man to underestimate she had made a miscalculation when she had allowed her pride to push her into the ridiculous wager a man like thorpe she mused would only be all the more determined to have his way for the sheer devil of it she should have simply ignored his fanciful statements about marriage the memory of his pleased confident smile when she had accepted the bet still haunted her he had looked too much like a cat who knew how to open the birdcage door but im not a canary she reminded herself as she walked into the newsroom and im not afraid of cats the newsroom was as it usually was noisy phones rang incessantly only the wall of television screens was silent interns bustled everywhere college students learning the trade running errands the assistant director argued with a field reporter over the edited length of a segment a crew headed out of the door with equipment and coffee cups how many kittens she heard a reporter ask into a phone she had them where liv the assignment editor hailed her with an upraised hand the mayors holding a press conference at two he stuck out a piece of paper as he breezed by thanks she wrinkled her nose at it that might give her the time she needed to make the two million phone calls on her list who wants a kitten she heard the plea as she moved through the room my cat just had ten of them in the kitchen sink my wifes going crazy hey liv brian caught her arm as she passed his desk i took two phone calls for you already this morning really she gave his jacket a critical glance new suit yeah he pulled a bit at the pearlgray lapels what do you think devastating she said knowing how brian worried about his ontheair image he could agonize over the shade of his tie about the phone calls i was a little worried about the fit in the shoulders he shifted them experimentally the first one was from mrs ditmyers secretary something about setting up a lunch date the second was from a character named dutch siedel said he had a tip for you really liv frowned thoughtfully dutch was the one dependable source she had on capitol hill he was a page with visions of a hot political career who do you know named dutch liv gave brian a guileless smile hes my bookie she said smoothly and started to walk away full of surprises arent you brian commented whos the dude who keeps sending you flowers that stopped her what brian smiled and examined his nails theres a fresh white rose on your desk just like the one last week the little intern with the frizzy hair said it came from upstairs he shot her a teasing look theres been a lot of buzzing about thorpes visit to the studio last week collaborating on a big story were not collaborating on anything liv spun on her heel and stalked to her desk there it was white and innocent with its petals gently closed she had a mad urge to crush it in her hand nobody ever sends me flowers liv turned and glared at the woman typing at the desk behind her you must have hooked a romantic she sighed lucky you lucky me liv muttered what was the man trying to do to her it occurred to liv that the room had become suspiciously quiet a quick sweep of her eyes caught several speculative glances and too many grins furious she swooped up the rose vase and all and plunked it down on the other reporters desk here she said with a broad gesture you can have it she stormed out of the room it was time she decided as she heard the scattered laughter behind her to lay down the ground rules liv was out of the elevator in a flash when it stopped on thorpes floor still seething she came to a halt at the receptionists desk is he in she demanded who thorpe well yes he is but he has an appointment with the chief of staff in twenty minutes ms carmichael she stared in exasperation at livs retreating back oh well she murmured and went back to her typewriter look liv began before the door had slammed shut behind her this has got to stop thorpe lifted a brow and set down the pen hed been writing with all right her teeth clamped together at his amiable answer you know what i mean no he gestured to a chair but im sure youre going to tell me have a seat this rose business she continued ignoring the chair and advancing to the desk its embarrassing thorpe youre doing it on purpose roses embarrass you he smiled at her infuriatingly what about carnations will you stop she leaned her palms on the desk much as she had done the first time she had stormed his office you might fool the brass with that crooked smile and choirboy look but not me you know just what youre doing its driving me crazy she paused a moment for breath and he leaned back you know what a rumor factory this place is before noon the entire newsroom is going to think im involved with you so im not involved with you i never have been and i never will be involved with you i dont want my associates thinking otherwise thorpe picked up the pen and tapped on the desk top do you think being involved with me damages your credibility that has nothing to do with it she snatched the pen out of his hand and tossed it across the room im not involved with you the hell you arent he countered smoothly wake up liv listen no you listen he rose and came around the desk she straightened to face him you were kissing me two days ago that has nothing shut up he said mildly i know what you felt and youre a fool if you think you can pretend otherwise im not pretending anything no he lifted his shoulder a bit as if he thought little of her statement in any case sending you a rose is hardly comparable to groping in the editing room during a coffee break if you want something tangible to be offended about i can oblige you he pulled her into his arms for the first time liv noticed the glint of anger in his eyes she refused to struggle it would be humiliating because he was stronger she tilted her chin and glared back at him i dont imagine you have to put much effort into being offensive thorpe not a bit he agreed im rather pressed for time right now or id demonstrate we can hash this out over dinner tonight im not having dinner with you tonight ill pick you up at seventhirty he said as he released her and picked up his jacket no i cant make it before sevenfifteen he kissed her quickly if we have things to say to each other they should be said in private dont you think he had a point and her mouth was still warm from his youll listen to what i have to say she asked cautiously of course he smiled and brushed her lips again lightly she stepped back and youll behave reasonably naturally he slipped on his jacket she was wary of his easy agreement but could hardly argue with it ive got to go ill walk you to the elevator all right as she walked with him liv wondered if she had won or lost the argument a draw she decided was the best she could make of it thorpe hesitated outside of livs apartment he wasnt sure why he was doing this he wasnt accustomed to rejection particularly rejection from a woman he had always had success both in his personal and professional life the professional success he had worked for hard success in his private life had always come easily he hadnt had to devote endless hours to research endless miles to legwork to lure a woman into his arms into his bed when he had been in his early twenties pounding washington pavements making contacts reporting on faulty sewage systems he had had his share of desirable women some might have said more than his share later when he had done an eighteenmonth stint abroad covering the delicate and explosive middle east there had still been women and as his name had become more well known his face more widely recognized his choices had become varied he knew he had only to pick up his phone and dial to insure himself an evenings companionship he knew scores of women interesting women beautiful women famous women he had come a long way from the boy who had hung around the old senators clubhouse still two things had remained the same he was determined to be the best in his field and when he wanted something he went after it thorpe thrust his hands in his pockets a moment and frowned at livs door was that why he was here he wondered but it wasnt as simple as that even standing there alone he could conjure up her face her voice her scent there had never been another woman in his life he could see so clearly when he was alone there hadnt been another woman who could make him ache at the thought of waiting she was a challenge yes and thorpe thrived on a challenge but that wasnt why he was there he loved her he wanted her and he was determined he was going to have her he pressed the doorbell and waited liv had her coat over her arm when she opened the door she had no intention of letting him in if she was going to be with him she preferred a restaurant where there would be no danger of making the mistake she had already made too many times im ready she said in her most distant tone so i see he didnt move as she shut the door at her back she was forced to push him out of her way or stand still she stood still he must have come straight from his broadcast though liv had no intention of admitting to him that she had watched it he had removed his tie however and had loosened the first few buttons of his shirt he looked as relaxed as she was tense youre still mad he smiled knowing he was baiting her but unable to resist he wasnt certain which expression he liked better the grave sincerity in her eyes during a broadcast or the controlled annoyance he so often saw when she looked at him liv wasnt angry but nervous and furious with herself for being susceptible to him she could already feel herself unbending to that smile i thought we were going to thrash this out over dinner thorpe not in the hall of my apartment building hungry she didnt want to smile but her lips betrayed her yes like italian food he asked taking her hand as they moved toward the elevator as a matter of fact i do she gave a slight tug to release her hand but he ignored it good i know a little place where the spaghetti is fantastic fine twenty minutes later they pulled up in front of the little place liv frowned at the high white building what are we doing here having dinner thorpe parked the car then leaned over to unlatch her door she slid out and waited for him they dont have an italian restaurant in the watergate no thorpe took her hand again and led her toward the front doors her suspicions began to peak you said we were going to an italian restaurant no i said we were having spaghetti after crossing the lobby thorpe punched an elevator button liv gave him a narrow look where he guided her into the elevator in my apartment oh no she felt panic as the car began its climb i agreed to have dinner with you so we could talk but i its hard to talk seriously in a noisy restaurant dont you think he said easily as the doors opened and i have a feeling you have a lot to say unlocking his door he gestured her inside yes i do but the thick aromatic scent of spiced sauce drifted to her she crossed the threshold who cooked the spaghetti i did thorpe slipped the jacket from her shoulders then shrugged out of his own you did not she looked at him in frank disbelief did a man with rough palms intelligent eyes and casual sophistication cook spaghetti chauvinist he accused and kissed her before she could prevent it thats not what i meant liv was distracted by the kiss and the enticing smell coming from the kitchen i know lots of men who cook but i didnt think i could thorpe finished for her he laughed keeping his hands on her arms her skin was too smooth to resist i like to eat i get tired of restaurants besides i learned when i was a kid my mother worked i fixed the meals his hands were gliding gently up and down her arms until she felt her skin begin to pulse it was an erotic sensation for him as well as for her workroughened palms against satin smoothness dont she whispered afraid she would be unable to prevent herself from taking the small step forward into his arms dont what liv watching the suppressed desire build in her eyes he felt his own growing dont touch me like that for a moment thorpe did nothing then casually he removed his hands are you any good in the kitchen the ground solidified under her feet not really can you toss a salad why was it so easy for him she wondered he could smile so effortlessly while her knees were still trembling probably if i follow directions ill write some down for you he took her arm in a friendly grip that still managed to shoot sparks down her spine come on give me a hand do you usually invite women to dinner then put them to work it was important to match his mood and forget the moment of weakness always the kitchen was a surprise onions garlic and potatoes hung in wire mesh baskets near the window while copperbottom pans dangled from hooks there were utensils she had never seen before all within easy reach of the stove or counter glass canisters stored colorful beans and differentshaped pasta her own kitchen was a barren desert compared to this here was a room of someone who not only knew how to cook but enjoyed it you really do cook liv marveled it relaxes me like rowing both take concentration and effort thorpe uncorked a bottle of burgundy and set it aside to breathe liv was drawn to the simmering crockpot when did you have time to do this he lifted the lid i put it on before i left for work this morning she narrowed her eyes at his easy smile youre terribly sure of yourself it was astonishing how often he had made her angry in such a short period of time here he said soothingly and dipped a wooden spoon into the pot taste pride fell before hunger and she opened her mouth to obey oh liv closed her eyes as the flavor seeped through her its immoral the best things tend to be thorpe dropped the lid on the pot again ill do the bread and pasta you do the salad he was already filling a pan with water liv hesitated a moment the sauce was still tangy on her tongue nothing she decided was going to stand between her and that spaghetti everythings in the fridge he added she located fresh vegetables and after filling her arms with them took them to the sink to wash ill need a salad bowl second cabinet over your head he added a dash of salt to the water after the flame was on under it she rummaged for the bowl as he began to slice bread he watched her as she stood on tiptoe to reach the bowl her dress floating up then down with her movements as she scrubbed a green pepper under a spray of water her fingers gliding over the skin she wore clear polish her nails were well shaped carefully tended but she never used color on them it was something he had noticed her makeup was always subdued understated as were her clothes thorpe wondered if it was a purposeful contrast to her more flamboyant sister or if it was simply a matter of taste liv carried the vegetables to the butcher block she glanced up when thorpe held a glass of wine out to her hard work deserves its rewards before she could empty her hands and take the glass he held it up to her lips his eyes were steady on hers thanks her voice was as cloudy as her mind she turned away quickly like it you usually drink white thorpe lifted the glass and drank himself its good liv gave all her attention to choosing a knife thorpe slipped one out of its slot and handed it to her its sharp he warned be careful im trying to be she murmured and set to work she could hear him moving around behind her pouring pasta into boiling water setting the bread under the broiler his presence was invading her senses by the time the salad was finished her nerves were jangling she took the wine he had left on the block and drank deeply settle down she cautioned herself or youll forget what you came for ready his hands came down on her shoulders and she just prevented herself from jolting yes all done good lets get started a small smokedglass table was set in front of a window it was a cozy intimate area despite the open view of the city raised from the living room by three steps and separated by an iron railing there were candles of varying sizes and shapes burning through the room the light was soft and flickering the english bone china was another surprise liv tried to divorce herself from the atmosphere while thorpe served the salad she had come to talk perhaps it was best to ease into it gently you have a beautiful apartment she began have you lived here long three years did you choose it for its she paused and smiled colorful past thorpe grinned no it suited my needs at the moment i was in israel when that went down ive always regretted not being here to report the story he offered her oil and vinegar i know an assignment editor who tossed the story out when he got the feed no time and he thought no one would care about some minor breakin i think hes selling used cars now in idaho liv laughed how long were you in the mideast too long he caught livs questioning glance hours of tedium and moments of terror not a healthy way to live war opens your eyes maybe too much to what a human beings capable of it must be very difficult she murmured trying to picture it reporting a war that kind of a war in a foreign country it was an experience he said with a move of his shoulders the trouble is when youre reporting you tend to forget youre human too for a while up here he tapped his temple youre indestructible the cameras a force field its a dangerous delusion one that bullets and grenades dont respect she understood what he meant she herself had once walked carelessly into a government building following a bomb detection team her mind had been on the story it hadnt been until later that the full impact of her action had struck her its strange isnt it she mused and its not just reporters cameramen are probably worse why do you suppose that is some like to claim its a mission a sacred duty to let the public know ive always considered it simply a matter of being caught up in the moment you do it because youre focused in on the story and the storys your job tunnel vision she said quietly remembering he had used the phrase before thats not as romantic as a mission he smiled watching the candlelight flicker over her skin do you look for romance in your work liv the question startled her bringing her back no no i dont now was the time she told herself which is exactly why i agreed to have dinner with you tonight to keep your romance separate from your work her brows drew together why did that sound so different when he said it yes no she amended ill get the spaghetti while you make up your mind liv cursed herself and tore a piece of garlic bread in two why was it things never went as she planned when she was around him and why did he always seem so on top of things straightening she reached for her wine she would simply start over here we go thorpe placed a platter of thin pasta topped with the thick sauce on the table thorpe liv began the aroma was irresistible and she filled her plate as she spoke i really thought you understood what i said to you the other day i understood perfectly olivia youre very articulate he helped himself when she had finished then you must see how difficult youre making things by sending you a flower he concluded and offered her grated cheese well yes it sounded so silly when he said it its very sweet but frowning she rolled spaghetti onto her fork i dont want you or anyone else to think that it means anything of course not he watched her sample the first bite how is it fabulous absolutely fabulous liv let the pure sensual pleasure of food spread through her slowly ive never tasted anything better she rolled a second forkful and tried to remember what point she had been trying to make in any case its not the sort of thing associates do you know the second forkful proved as satisfying as the first what isnt it gave him a great deal of satisfaction to watch her preoccupation with his cooking her tongue slid lightly over the fork send flowers she stated to each other especially when theres rivalry as well local and national news are siblings i know a bit about sibling rivalry your sister he commented the candlelight shot little flecks of gold into her eyes he could almost count them mmm with a sister like melinda ive had experience at being the underdog i never minded it makes you more inventive the same goes for doing the local news is that how you look at it he asked curiously he picked up one of her hands to examine the delicately painted nails as being the underdog you have the big budget she pointed out the large exposure publicity but that doesnt mean we cant have the same quality on a smaller scale there was a callus on his thumb she could feel its light scrape across her knuckles an unexpected chill shot straight down her spine carefully liv removed her hand and reached for her wine but thats not the point what is thorpe smiled at her the slow personal smile that scattered her wits liv hastily pulled herself together you know how stories fly around a newsroom internal stories she specified as she returned to her dinner its a difficult place to have any privacy privacys important to me yes it must be there hasnt been any mention of you in the papers or glossies since you were a teenager the carmichaels always make good copy i didnt fit the mold she hadnt meant to say that and was astonished it had slipped out what im trying to say she continued as thorpe kept his silence is that once someone in your newsroom or mine gets hold of an idea the next minute itll be fact then the skys the limit you know how a simple coffee date can become a torrid lunchtime affair after the third telling does it matter so much liv gave a weary sigh probably not from your standpoint but from mine yes i have to deal with being the new kid on the block and a woman its still hard thorpe whatever progress i make is always examined more closely than anyone elses right now is carmichael seeing thorpe because she wants to jump on the national news team he studied her a moment you dont have enough confidence in yourself im a good reporter she countered immediately i was speaking about you as a woman he saw the shield come up and could have sworn in frustration thats none of your concern isnt that what were talking about he countered i sent a woman a rose not a reporter i am a reporter thats your profession not your sex he lifted his wine and forced back annoyance he knew anger was no way to get through to her it doesnt do to have thin skin in this business liv if newsroom gossip bothers you youre going to get a lot of bruises look in the mirror people talk about a woman with a face like yours its human nature it isnt only that liv subsided a bit she had wanted to talk to him it wouldnt help if she became angry i dont want any personal involvement not with you not with anyone thorpe studied her in silence over the rim of his glass were you hurt that badly she hadnt expected the question or the trace of sympathy in it it cost her a great deal to keep her eyes level and composed yes he left it at that that she had made the admission instead of freezing was enough he would wait for the rest why did you come to washington liv looked at him a moment she had been prepared for further interrogation but not for a casual change of subject warily she allowed herself to relax again id always been interested in politics that was my beat in austin though most of the time i did little but read the news on the air when wwbw made the offer i grabbed it she began to give her attention to the meal again its an exciting city especially from a reporters viewpoint i wanted the excitement i suppose i wanted the pressure have you thought of doing national news she made a vague gesture with her shoulders of course but for now im happy where i am carls the best news director ive ever worked with thorpe grinned he does have a tendency to become emotional liv lifted a brow as she toyed with the last of her spaghetti particularly when some hotshot from upstairs steals a story i had to step on the toes of one of your associates after the mayors press conference this afternoon is that so which one thompson the one with the big ears and flashy ties a flattering description accurate liv countered but a smile tugged at her lips in any case id gone to a lot of trouble to set up a quick interview after the conference he tried to cash in on it you set him straight im sure liv let the smile form it rather pleased her to recall how she had dispatched the enterprising thompson as a matter of fact i did i told him to do his own legwork or theyd find him hung by his tie in the basement of the rayburn building she paused consideringly i think he believed me thorpe looked into the cool blue eyes i think i do too why didnt you just sic your cameraman on him liv grinned and scooped up the last of her spaghetti i didnt want a vulgar scene in front of the mayor want some more he gestured toward her empty plate liv sat back with a sigh youve got to be kidding dessert her eyes widened you didnt really make dessert leaning forward thorpe tipped more burgundy into her glass drink your wine he suggested ill be right back he took the plates away with him liv gave a moments thought to giving him a hand then sat back she was too content to move it was foolish to deny she enjoyed his company liked talking to him arguing with him she had nearly forgotten how stimulating an argument could be he made her feel alive vital she didnt quite feel safe with him and even that was exciting liv glanced up as she heard him come back at the sight of the dish of strawberries and cream he carried she gave a low sound of pleasure they look marvelous how did you get your hands on strawberries that size this early in the season a reporter never reveals his sources she sighed as he set the dish on the table they look wonderful thorpe but i dont think i can manage it try one he insisted dipping a berry into the fresh whipped cream just one she agreed and obligingly opened her mouth as he started to feed it to her he smeared the cream along her cheek thorpe liv said on a laugh and reached for her napkin sorry he laid his hand on top of hers preventing her from lifting the napkin ill get it cupping her neck with his other hand he slowly lightly began to nibble the cream from her cheek livs laughter stilled she didnt move couldnt protest her mind and body were locked in the shock of sensation her skin seemed alive only where his tongue glided over it good he murmured passing his lips over hers liv said nothing her eyes were locked on his thorpe watched her steadily as he read the stunned passion in her eyes slowly he dipped a second berry and offered it another liv shook her head swallowing as she watched his teeth slice through the berry rising she stepped down into the living room she had to be on her feet to think she told herself in a moment she would feel perfectly normal again the trembling would stop the heat would cool a startled gasp escaped her when thorpe turned her into his arms i thought youd like to dance he murmured dance she melted into his arms there isnt any music but she was moving with him and her head was already resting on his shoulder cant you hear it her scent was teasing his senses her breasts yielded softly as he drew her closer she sighed and closed her eyes the candlelight flickered against her lids her limbs felt heavy much too comfortably so she leaned on thorpe she tried to tell herself she had had too much to drink that was what she was feeling but she knew it was a lie when his lips passed over her ear she sighed again and shuddered i should go she told herself i should leave now right now her fingers wandered into his hair its madness to stay a slow kindling longing was building as his body moved against hers his hand slid up her spine and down again to settle at her waist when she felt his lips on her neck she gave a low sound drugged in pleasure i cant stay she murmured but made no effort to move from his arms no he agreed as his mouth made a leisurely journey to hers i should go her lips sought his yes he slipped his tongue between her parted lips to touch hers liv felt her bones dissolve and her head spin i have to leave mmmhmm gently he lowered the zipper at the back of her dress she made a muffled sound as his hands ran over the thin chemise im not going to get involved with you thorpe her mouth was moist and heated as he explored it i know youve told me her dress slid to the floor she pressed closer and let his mouth find hers again she was drowning but the water was so warm so soft the need for him was sleepy growing as he moved his hands over her she was a prisoner of his touch a touch that was gentle she made no protest when he lifted her into his arms moonlight filtered into the bedroom shadowed light softly white liv nearly broke through the surface thorpe then he kissed her again lost longing she clung to him as he lowered her to the bed he undressed her slowly with soft kisses and caresses the words he murmured were quiet stroking her nerves arousing her body when his back was bare liv ran her hand over it there was hard strength she wanted him to be strong needed for him to be he lowered the chemise to her waist following the trail of his hands with his mouth desire changed from dreamy to desperate in a flash liv moaned and pressed him closer until his mouth was hungry at her breast her movements under him were no longer languid her hands no longer timid she arched to help him strip the thin garment from her he ran his hands up the inside of her thighs and she felt a rush of heat engulf her she crested on a moan but he slid his fingers over and inside her driving her up again she dug her nails into his shoulders nothing no one had ever made her feel like this mindless aching glowing liv wanted him to take her but he had other pleasures to give his tongue glided down her torso flicking over the curve of her waist until she knew she would go mad wandering he moved lower still until on a strangled gasp she peaked again her responsiveness overwhelmed him taking him beyond his own desire he wanted her to experience every drop of pleasure he could give she was sensitive to every touch every thought though the moonlight gave her skin a marble hue it felt like liquid fire under his hands need for her vibrated through him each time she moaned his name or reached for him the shock of it rocketed straight through him desire pulsated from her for him that alone took him to the edge of reason his mouth crushed down on hers and liv answered the demand ravenously all restraint had fled all barriers were broken she knew only a desperate need for fulfillment and the one man who could give it to her she opened for him then guided him inside of her her gasp was muffled against his shoulder she felt the muscles tense and ripple against her mouth as he took her beyond what she remembered past what she had dreamed of she gave herself up completely and went with him thorpe lay wrapped round her holding on to the warmth for him the world had whittled down to the bed to the woman even in the dark he could see her each curve of her body each plane of her face in all of his memory he had never felt so involved so totally united her skin was smooth against his her nipples still taut as her breasts pressed against his chest her breathing was leveling slowly he had known there was passion under her strict control but he hadnt guessed the depth of it or what its effect on him would be he was vulnerable almost defenseless for the first time in his life liv felt the intensity of passion drain into contentment she had never experienced that sort of abandonment had that been missing all of her life she was almost afraid to find the answer and what it would mean one basic truth was that he had made her feel like a woman again complete the taste of him still lingered on her lips and tongue she didnt want to lose it or the warm security she now held nestled in her arms but who was thorpe she wondered who was he who had drawn from her what she had been unable or unwilling to give any man for more than five years i promised myself this wouldnt happen she murmured and buried her face against his neck her words forced thorpe out of his dreamy state regrets he asked carefully and waited what seemed a lifetime for the answer no liv gave a long sigh no regrets she tilted her face back i never expected to be here with you like this but i dont regret it he relaxed again and held her closer the soft serious words stirred him olivia youre such a complicated woman am i she smiled a little and closed her eyes ive never thought so too simple perhaps and singleminded but not complicated ive been working on sorting you out for a year and a half he returned it isnt an easy job dont try she let her hand roam over his shoulder again she liked the feel of muscle knowing he could control it into gentleness thorpe have you had many lovers he gave a muffled laugh thats a delicate question to ask at the moment carmichael i wasnt going to ask for names and numbers she countered sighing as his hand moved down her back its just that i havent really im not very good at it good at what he asked absently his casual explorations were teasing his own need for her she felt awkward suddenly and searched for a phrase at ah pleasing a partner the movement of his hand stopped and he drew back to study her face in the darkness are you joking well no she was embarrassed now if she hadnt been so relaxed she would never have put herself into such a position she fumbled on i know im not very exciting in bed but who the hell put that into your head the sharp annoyance surprised her my husband trembled on the edge of her mind its just something ive known he swore ripely and stopped her do you think i was pretending just now no she was confused suddenly and unsure of herself were you he was angry almost unreasonably so rolling he pinned her beneath him i wanted you from the first moment i saw your face did you know that she shook her head unable to speak a fresh surge of passion raced through her at the press of his body the grip of his hands youre so cool so aloof and i could see all those whispers of heat i wanted you like this naked in my bed his mouth crushed down on hers bruisingly furiously her lips were eager for his accepting the anger the demand matching the hunger i wanted to strip away the layers he muttered he moved his hands over her until she was writhing mindlessly i was going to have you melt all that ice his hand slipped between her thighs and she arched yearning for him but there wasnt any ice any need for games when i held you if you didnt please another man it was his fault his loss remember it she was on fire her hands touched searched stroked on their own power while her mouth roamed his neck she could feel his pulse go wild under her tongue she pulled at him dragging his mouth back to hers the taste his taste she was desperate for it he trembled with her then the kiss was savage staggering her with the knowledge that she had taken him beyond the civilized this was no pretense he was totally lost in her in what they made together she felt it marveled at it then swirled into a mist where no thoughts could penetrate she was limp utterly spent her breath and body shuddering his weight was on her fully and his back was damp under her hands there was no measuring the time they lay there replete in each other i suppose youre right his voice was dark and husky that wasnt very exciting liv didnt think she had the energy to laugh but it bubbled inside her warm and comfortable she didnt know how he knew exactly the right thing to say but she accepted it it was a novel and wonderful sensation to laugh in bed he lifted his head and grinned at her idiot he said softly and kissed her shifting he gathered her to his side she was asleep in moments and lay still he held her chapter contents prev next the alarm clock went off with a shrill automatically liv reached over to shut off the blast and rolled into thorpe her eyes shot open disoriented groggy she stared into his eyes while the bell continued to peal part of her mind registered the shadow of beard on his chin the sleepy heaviness of his eyes as they looked into hers i slept with him she remembered made love with him and slept the night in his bed the knowledge registered slowly she could feel a trace of astonishment in the full light of day but though she searched and wondered there were still no regrets she had been given passion gentleness caring how could there be regrets thorpe reached behind him and snapped off the alarm silence was abrupt and complete saying nothing he gathered liv against him he had seen the dazed surprise in her face then the gradual understanding and acceptance he found it amusing and strangely endearing this wasnt a woman who made it a habit of waking up in a mans bed the quiet morning cuddle was a new sensation and liv drifted with it undemanding intimacy tangled with him she explored it sleepily she wasnt certain what she was feeling what emotion was this contentment happiness simple pleasure at being close enough to touch and be touched something had changed doors had opened she wasnt sure whether she or thorpe had turned the lock but it had been done his breath was warm on her cheek his arms lightly possessive around her she was no longer alone did she want to be she felt the pressure of his body against her yesterday she had been certain that solitude was the answer for her but now she had made love with him shared herself taken from him liv wasnt a casual person intimacy was no small gesture for her intimacy meant commitment to her the two had always would always walk hand in hand and yet she had promised herself there would be no more commitments in her life no more onetoone relationships there was too much in her past to remind her of the risks he was becoming too important she was becoming too vulnerable it was much too easy to stay where she was wrapped tight held close if she stayed too long she might forget how quickly disillusionment came she shifted wanting to break the bond before it became too strong i have to get up i have to be in by ninethirty still silent thorpe brought her back to him his mouth closed gently over hers she was so soft so warm and her scent still lingered hed waited long too long to wake beside her now he wanted to enjoy the moment he wanted to see how she looked in the morning fresh from sleep her eyes still heavy he had slept beside her awakened beside her he didnt intend to be without her again liv responded to the gentleness and the lazy arousal for a moment she could pretend there was no outside world that demanded their involvement and no past to inhibit her there was only the two of them if she closed her eyes she could imagine it was still night and they had hours left to hold each other but time was passing the sun was a pale yellow light through the windows we have to get up she murmured almost wishing he would contradict her mmm he shifted his head slightly to see the clock apparently he agreed and settled for a last nuzzle of her throat i dont suppose your conscience would allow you to come down with a sudden case of laryngitis or a convenient fever would yours she countered he laughed and kissed her at the moment i have no conscience i wish i could say the same easing away from him she sat up automatically pressing the sheet to her breast im going to need a robe pity with a groan he rolled away from her and rose ill supply you with a robe and breakfast he added as he padded to the closet if you handle the coffee she was a little stunned to see him stand naked in front of the closet straightening her shoulders she told herself not to be a fool she had just spent the night with him his body was no secret to her now but to see him liv thought as he pulled out the first robe for himself he was magnificently built hard lean with broad sinewy shoulders and a long torso she had indeed often thought he seemed streamlined in his clothes without them he appeared more the athlete okay he pulled out a short kimonostyle robe in blue terry and turned to her she had lost what he had been saying her eyes lifted to the amusement in his what im sorry can you make coffee liv he grinned as he held out the robe have you got a jar and a spoon he looked pained are you joking i was afraid you wouldnt ill manage i suppose she told him doubtfully and slipped her arms into the robe the percolators on the counter coffees on the second shelf over the stove he instructed as he swung into the bath see what you can do she wrinkled her nose as he shut the door then rose from the bed in the kitchen she found things precisely where he had told her she ran water and measured coffee just barely she could hear the sound of the shower running she found it an odd sensation to be poking around in his kitchen naked under his robe im having an affair she thought she held the top of the percolator aloft a moment staring into space she had made love with thorpe had spent the night in his bed and was now preparing coffee in his kitchen in his robe she reminded herself running a hand down the lapel with a quick shake of her head she fit the lid on top of the pot for goodness sake im twentyeight years old ive been married and divorced im a professional woman whos been on her own for years why shouldnt i have an affair people do every day its a part of life its very simple even casual to make anything else out of it is foolish were two adults who just spent the night together thats all there is to it even as she ran the last of these cool sensible words in her head thorpe came into the room liv turned to say something mildly sarcastic about the coffee and found herself folded into his arms his mouth touched hers softly at first twice the third time they lingered and grew hungry she lifted her arms to bring him closer everything she had just told herself was forgotten his hair was still damp as her fingers combed through it the scent of soap and shaving lotion brushed at her senses everything seemed new and fresh like a first romance his hands rested at the sides of her breasts then lowered to her hips it wasnt a desperate kiss but a strong one it brought echoes of the night back to her thorpe drew back a little to look at her i like you this way he murmured barefoot in a robe several sizes too big for you with your hair a little mussed he lifted a hand to it and disordered it further ill be able to picture you this way when i watch the cool ms carmichael deliver the news fortunately for the ratings the viewers wont their loss not everyone appreciates the rumpled justoutofbed look thorpe the coffee was perking frantically and she drew out of his arms there were mugs suspended from hooks under the cabinets liv slipped two off and poured but then i appreciate the calm sleekly groomed look too he pointed out offering her a small carton of cream for her coffee actually i havent found anything about you that doesnt appeal to me liv laughed and glanced up at him are you always so agreeable before your coffee thorpe she handed him a mug id better shower while you drink this it might sour your mood he started to lift it to his lips and she placed a hand on his arm to stop him remember before you drink it you did promise to fix me breakfast she left him taking her own mug with her thorpe glanced back down at his coffee then sipped doubtfully it wasnt quite as bad as she had prophesied obviously he thought as he drank again the kitchen wasnt her area it was his he concluded philosophically and went to the refrigerator he could hear the shower running he liked knowing she was close only a few rooms away he took out a slab of bacon and heated a pan thorpe wasnt a man to delude himself they had made love they would make love again but livs feelings were not as defined as his it was uncomfortable to find himself in the position of caring deeply for someone who didnt return the same depth of emotion she could he told himself as the bacon sizzled she was fighting it he was too confident a man to consider he might lose in the end even in the bright sunlight of the kitchen he could remember her open giving of the night before her initial hesitation the gradual change to aggression and passion whatever she said she was a complex woman full of hidden corners and contradictions he wouldnt have it any other way since he had fallen in love he preferred it to be with a woman who had a few eddies and currents fate might have bound him to a tamer type olivia carmichael was the woman for him and he was the man for her he might have to be patient until he convinced her but convince her he would thorpe smiled as he cracked an egg into a bowl as it had the night before the scent coming from the kitchen drew liv irresistibly standing in the doorway she stared at the platter thorpe was piling with bacon golden eggs and lightly browned toast thorpe she said inhaling deeply youre amazing you just noticed he countered grab a couple plates he ordered jerking his head toward the proper cabinet lets eat before it gets cold liv did as he bade plucking up the flatware as well before she followed i have to admit she said as she took her chair at the table that im in deep awe of anyone who can fix a meal and consistently have everything ready at the same time what do you eat at home as little as possible she began to help herself from the platter mostly i use all those little boxes that say complete meal inside sometimes there really is liv do you have any idea what sort of things they put inside those little boxes please thorpe she shoveled a forkful of eggs into her mouth not while im eating he laughed and shook his head didnt you ever learn to cook liv lifted a shoulder she remembered the meals she had fixed during her marriage they had usually been hurried dinners put together before she had dashed on to the evening shift at the station a quick something after classes she had cooked adequately even well on sporadic occasions but there had been so little time and so many obligations she skipped back over that to give him the answer when i was growing up my mother didnt consider it important in fact she added after finishing off a slice of bacon she didnt care to hear about the few times i poked into the kitchen to see what was going on that wasnt our territory thorpe buttered a slice of toast and considered how remarkably diverse their backgrounds had been he and his mother had been close both from necessity and out of love liv and hers had been distant perhaps from a simple lack of understanding do you go back to connecticut often no there was a signal in the one word dont press too close thorpe recognized it and detoured hows your schedule today packed the first ladys dedicating that childrens center at eleven dells due into national at one though i doubt well be able to get near him and i have another stakeout at the school board this afternoon she finished off the rest of her eggs im scheduled to tape another promo the general managers nervous about the ratings arent they all he glanced at her empty plate well at least youre fortified if thats your subtle way of saying i stuffed myself ill overlook it rising liv began to gather the plates since you cooked it ill wash up while you dress very democratic she kept her eyes on the plates and platters ill need to go back to my apartment to change before i go in ill take a cab dont be ridiculous unsure of her moves liv lifted the stack of plates its silly for you to drive halfway across town out of your way it would be simpler he stopped her by taking the stack of plates out of her hands and setting them back on the table placing his hands on her shoulders he studied her face it was in his eyes again the searching the depth of intensity that was inescapable liv last night meant something to me being with you means something to me he could see the quick flicker of emotions as she digested his words no cabs no cabs she agreed then slipped her arms around him to hold him tightly the gesture surprised him moved him liv closed her eyes and held on she had been afraid he would agree without a second thought the sensible part of herself had told her it would be best keep it light keep it sophisticated take a cab and see you later but her heart wanted more and her heart was beginning to outweigh everything else will you wait for me tonight he murmured into her hair until after my broadcast she tilted her face to his yes as his mouth touched hers she thought fleetingly that the ground she was treading on might be dangerous but she hadnt felt so alive in years it was five thirtytwo when thorpe stood in the control room and watched liv through the window he paid scant attention to her report on a robbery at a local chain store or to the technical aspects of television that went on around him she had quite simply been on his mind all day hed wanted to see her again before it was his turn in front of the camera punch up camera one carl ordered from his seat in front of the wall of monitors she was there too reproduced eight times in the blackandwhite preview monitors and the live color ones her voice came through in stereo from the speakers at his left an engineer worked at the sound board camera two brians image replaced livs on the live monitor at carls next order the graphics were punched up to flash behind him thirty seconds to commercial brian continued smoothly to the cut carl drew hard on a cigarette and shot a glance over his shoulder at thorpe see you around here more now than when you worked here he commented ive more incentive he answered easily carl studied livs image in the monitor and gave a grunt of agreement hed always liked thorpe as a man respected him as a reporter he wished that he had been able to keep him on staff carl gave a sigh and crushed out the cigarette he doubted hed keep carmichael more than a couple of years hed been around too long to expect anything different thirty seconds thorpe looked back through the window liv was talking to brian she laughed at something and shook her head was it his imagination or did she seem more relaxed more free it would be well over an hour before he could touch her again camera one was focused on her and on cue she began the next segment of the broadcast thorpe left the control room with her voice still echoing in his mind with the show over liv went back to the newsroom she had weighed the pros and cons of going upstairs to meet thorpe and had decided that to wait for him in her own territory would generate less speculation and less gossip she was not ready to put her personal life on display she missed him the fact had surprised her but there was no denying it her day had been hectic at moments frantic but somehow he had hovered on the edges of her thoughts throughout it keeping to her desk she began to go over her next days schedule her eyes drifted again and again to the clock why when the day had flown by did one hour seem to be an eternity this lady looks like she wants a cup of coffee glancing up liv smiled at bob and held out a hand i always knew you had great perception id rather be irresistibly sexy he commented and sat on the corner of her desk of course you are her eyes laughed at him over the rim of the plastic cup i constantly have to restrain myself yeah he grinned at her can i tell my wife ill leave that up to your own discretion i worked with prye today bob sighed into his coffee cup you know the little thirtysecond standup he did in front of the kennedy center mmmhmm liv knew what was coming and settled back in her chair fourteen takes you wouldnt believe how many times that guy can blow a line he got irked when i asked him if he wanted us to make up some idiot cards for him we should have more respect for the talent he snorted and gulped down more coffee he wouldnt know talent if it walked up and chewed on his ankle liv opted to play the diplomat she was well aware that prye had a running battle with the crews the standup came across very well lucky for him he doesnt have to go live if i had my choice he said and winked at her i wouldnt work with anyone who didnt have great legs you know he cocked his head to study her you look different she lifted a brow could it be that a night of love and freedom had left some noticeable change if youre trying to save yourself from prye tomorrow she said lightly ive already talked to the desk about having you work with me he grinned again thanks but id rather have a wild weekend in acapulco acapulco she repeated pretending to consider it we could use your expense account livs already occupied this weekend thorpe said mildly both bob and liv turned to look at him he glanced down at her then back at the cameraman shes going to be rowing no kidding the information seemed to give bob more reason to grin i guess ill have to settle for sunday dinner at my inlaws he rose and giving liv a brief salute left them thorpe he had her arm and was already propelling her through the room i havent made any plans for the weekend i have he returned amiably and youre included i have this small idiosyncrasy she told him when they stepped outside about having a voice in my own plans im flexible he opened the car door for her leaned on it and smiled if youd rather go to acapulco i can arrange it it was difficult to feel annoyed when he was smiling at her she let out a small huff of a sigh i might consider rowing she said and gave in to the urge to touch his mouth with hers if you man the oars chapter contents prev next so much could change in a week liv could almost forget what it was like to be alone truly alone the nights no longer held absolute silence she could almost forget what it was like to have no one but herself to depend upon there was someone in her life again she no longer attempted to reason out how he had gotten there she was growing to rely on thorpes companionship she was growing to enjoy the pleasures of intimacy simply she was growing to need thorpe as the days passed she found she looked forward not only to their conversations but even to their arguments he stimulated her forced her to think fast if she wanted to hold her own intellectually they complemented each other there were times she knew he sharpened his wit on her just as she did on him his strength was important to her there was something rock solid about him she had once looked for the solidity in someone else and had been disappointed she wasnt looking for protection she had been through too much to doubt her own ability to deal with whatever life tossed at her when you had gone through the worst and survived nothing could ever hurt you in quite the same way again but if she chose a partner a companion a lover he had to have strength she was still cautious there were still guards over her emotions but they were growing weaker as he had promised thorpe took her to a night ball game im telling you he should look for another profession she stated as she stuck the key in the lock of her door she brooded over the faults of the plate umpire as she shrugged out of her jacket dont they have to go to school or something before they become umpires or something thorpe agreed not even trying to hide a grin liv had been indignant over the umpires calls during the entire drive home well she concluded he must have gotten dreadful marks i wouldnt be surprised if hes a nasty person who kicks his dog a sentiment probably shared by a number of ballplayers thorpe slipped out of his jacket and tossed it to join hers maybe its time you took over the sportscast liv she gave him an arch look i might do very well she returned after a few more games i could probably report a play by play as well as i do a filibuster would you like a brandy fine he smiled at her back as she fixed the drinks leaving the play by play aside for the moment and concentrating on filibusters what do you think of donahues chances slim liv responded and turned back with two snifters i talked to him today taking the brandy from her thorpe drew liv down on the couch beside him right before he went onto the floor hes brownbagging it he must have had five ham sandwiches and a half a dozen doughnuts liv laughed well at least he wont go hungry that should give him the stamina to keep his filibuster going if his voice holds out hes determined thorpe commented he told me hes going to outlast and outtalk every one of his opponents if force of will and ham on rye can do it donahues got it made liv settled back against his shoulder and his arm automatically encircled her the gallery was packed for most of the day we did some manonthestreets liv murmured sleepy now with contentment most people were there from pure curiosity rather than any interest in the issue but a full gallery and a filibuster make good press that might keep donahue going a few days longer he made it through day five id like to see him win she sighed how had she ever been comfortable without his arm around her i know its unrealistic and the bill will pass eventually but still he listened to her slow quiet voice there was a parallel between donahue and himself he thought thorpe had launched his own filibuster with liv he was just as determined as the senator to win a full victory it wasnt enough just to be able to hold her he wanted needed a lifetime how much longer was it going to take there were times when the need for caution frustrated him to the point of anger he set down his drink and then hers liv lifted her face for the kiss but it was not as she had expected his mouth was fierce she was pressed back against the cushions of the sofa with his body fitted to hers he tugged at her clothes impatiently this was something new always there had been a thread of control in his lovemaking as if he compensated for the difference in their physical strengths with gentleness now she felt the urgency as he pushed open her blouse to find her his mouth was locked on hers so that she couldnt speak or even moan as he stripped off her jeans she fumbled with his sweater wanting to be flesh to flesh but the press of their bodies together hampered her with a low savage oath thorpe stripped it off himself pulling it over his head then letting it fall to the floor his mouth was suddenly everywhere tasting ravishing she was pliant fluid under his touch she flowed wherever he took her rising and falling to his whim there was a wildness in him she had only glimpsed before he took her on the couch as if it had been years since their last joining the desperation went on and on until she knew there could be no more either of them could want or give then he was pulling her to the floor with him heating her again while her body was still humming she moaned his name once half in protest half in disbelief as her passion mounted again more was all he said before his mouth took hers his hands were as avid as they had been at the first touch and her body as receptive there was in her now an overwhelming need to possess to be possessed no longer was she only guided her hands sought him found him while her mouth clung hot and fast to his she was shuddering without being aware of it she heard only his labored breath in her ear when she wrapped around him need and fulfillment seemed to burst within her at once then she was once more pliant once more limp this time thorpe lay beside her and let his body rest yet he couldnt prevent himself from touching her still her skin drew him and the curve where waist flared to hip his hands were gentle now he kissed the slope of her shoulder the delicate line of her jaw he heard her sigh as she moved closer to him as fiercely as passion had whipped through him before now love ached inside him i love you he felt her immediate stillness and realized he had spoken aloud cupping her chin in his hand he lifted her face to his i love you he said again he hadnt meant to tell her in exactly this way but now that it had been done he kept his eyes on hers he wanted her to understand he meant what he said she heard the words saw them repeated in his eyes something moved inside of her like a tugofwar toward him and away no she shook her head and the word was weak no dont i dont want you to you dont have any choice the statement was calmer than his mood her answer and the anxiety in her eyes cut at him and it seems neither do i no pushing away she sat up to cradle her head in her hands old doubts old fears old resolutions crowded at her pressure was squeezing her in a tight fist i cant you cant love that dangerous dangerous word that left you naked and senseless accepting it was a risk giving it a disaster how could she let herself be caught in the web again thorpe took her shoulders and turned her to face him her response left him hurt and angry the pale miserable look on her face only added to it but i do love you he said curtly not wanting me to doesnt change it i love you have loved you for quite some time if youd bothered to look youd have seen that thorpe please she could only shake her head how could she explain to him what did she want to explain she wanted him to hold her until she could think clearly again love how did it feel to know she was loved if she could have a few moments if her heart would stop pounding im not interested in only having your body olivia she could hear the temper and frustration in his voice she stiffened against it no she would not be pressured she would not be maneuvered she was still in charge of her own life he could feel the change his fingers tightened on her skin in impotent fury what do you want a great deal more he said deliberately than youre willing to give me trust i suppose would be a good start i cant give you any more than i have she wanted to tremble to weep to cling to him she kept her eyes level i dont love you i dont want you to love me neither knew the extent of pain their words caused the other she saw only a flare in his eyes that made her realize how strictly he controlled his own violence if he had had less of a grip on himself she felt certain he would have struck her for the cold dispassion of her words she almost wished he would at the moment she would have gladly exchanged physical pain for the emotional one slowly he released her he hadnt known he could be hurt like this in silence he dressed he knew he had to leave quickly before he did something he would detest himself for she wouldnt drive him to that not by rejection or her damn coolness or anything else hed leave her to herself since thats what she wanted the sooner she was out of his sight the sooner he could work on forgetting her he cursed himself for being a fool even as he shut the door behind him the sound of it closing brought livs head around for a full minute she stared at the panel the silence welled up around her curling into a ball she lay on the rug and wept for both of them the normal routine of a day was like an obstacle course getting up dressing driving through rush hour traffic to liv it all seemed larger more complicated than it ever had before in a morning crammed with appointments she went through the hours with a combination of nervous energy and dull fatigue her thoughts could never be completely centered on her objective when thorpe was always just around the edges she had begun to taste happiness again and now everything had happened so fast liv hadnt expected him to love her she knew enough of him understood enough of him to be certain he wasnt a man to love lightly his energy and power would be bound up in it when a man like thorpe loved a woman she was loved completely perhaps that was what frightened her most yet what she felt now as she finished up an interview wasnt fear it was emptiness before thorpe had become a part of her life she had accepted the emptiness the void had been filled as nearly as possible with her work and her ambition it was no longer enough during the morning a dozen things happened that she found herself wanting to share with him years had passed without her feeling the need to share with anyone and now it was inescapable but she had pushed him away what should she do now how could she make him understand that while part of her wanted to love him to be loved by him another part was like a rabbit under a gun frozen terrified how could she expect him to understand she asked herself as she mechanically negotiated through afternoon traffic she was no longer sure she understood herself put it on hold for a while she advised herself have lunch with mrs ditmyer relax and then try to think fresh again hoping she could take her own advice liv pulled into the parking lot beside the restaurant it was the perfect way to take her mind off things she decided part business part social a glimpse at her watch told her she was barely five minutes late nothing major it wouldnt do to keep myra ditmyer waiting long i like her liv thought as she entered the restaurant shes so alive greg was lucky to have her for an aunt for all her matchmaking tendencies liv could only wish the cards had dealt her a similar relative a woman like that would be sturdy as a boulder when the world crumbled under your feet liv shook away the thought there was also the matter of her position in washington political and social circles since myra had taken it into her head to notice her liv might as well take advantage of the side benefits mrs ditmyers table she told the maitre d ms carmichael he smiled when she inclined her head this way please liv followed him amused as a carmichael she recognized deferential treatment as a presswoman she had learned not to expect it olivia myra greeted her as though they were the fastest of friends how charming you look and how lovely it is to have men staring again even if theyre only speculating whether im your mother or your maiden aunt from albuquerque liv was laughing even as the maitre d assisted her into her chair mrs ditmyer i knew having lunch with you would be the high point of my day what a sweet thing to say she beamed pleased with herself paul do see about some sherry for ms carmichael of course mrs ditmyer the maitre d bowed away from the table now then myra folded her hands on the table expectantly you must tell what wonderfully exciting things youve been doing im sure running around reporting on political corruption and worldshaking events must keep you forever in a spin liv laughed it was impossible not to be relaxed and exhilarated simultaneously in the womans company it seems a crime to disappoint you mrs ditmyer but most of the time i spend waiting at airports or outside the gate at the white house or she added with an apologetic grin on the telephone finding out where im going to wait next oh my dear you mustnt burst my bubble myra sipped her own glass of sherry im perfectly content if you make something up just so its exciting and call me myra ive decided were going to get along famously do you know i believe we will liv shook her head im sorry to say we cant all be woodwards and bernsteins but i suppose all reporters run into a fat story now and again right now the heat is on senator donahues filibuster ah michael myra smiled then nodded with approval as livs sherry was set in front of her feisty old devil ive always been fond of him nobody rhumbas like michael donahue liv nearly choked on her sherry is that so i shall have to introduce you next month when i give my spring ball you do rhumba dont you dear ill learn myra smiled in her dazzling way then crocked a finger at the waiter i unfortunately will have to make do with the fruit salad my dressmakers sighing horribly these days she gave liv a wistful glance that wasnt envious so much as reminiscent the scampis exquisite here fruit salad will do nicely liv returned being able to sit down for lunch is treat enough i still have to thank you for asking me liv went on as the waiter moved away it really isnt often i have the opportunity to have an hour like this in the middle of the day but of course you can justify the luxury by terming it as partly business myra laughed at livs expression oh no my dear you mustnt think it offends me why not in the least its actually part of my intention now she leaned forward a bit like a general preparing to outline a plan of attack you must tell me what special project you have in mind i know you must have one its simply in your character liv sat back though she held the glass of sherry she didnt drink she was too enthralled with the woman across from her myra i believe you would have made a fabulous reporter a pleased pink flush spread on her cheeks do you really how marvelous i do so love to nose around you know yes liv answered faintly so myra spread her hands palms up tell me what you have in mind liv shook her head and smiled all right ive been toying with trying a news special probably slotted for late night a personal view of women in politics not only women politicians but women married to politicians how they deal with the stress business family public exposure traveling id like to think i could deal with both sides of the coin that way women who are immersed in government for varying reasons yes myra pouted in thought that might prove quite interesting it can be the very devil on a marriage you know the campaigning the staff dinners the state dinners the protocol lengthy separations high pressure its a horse race my dear one long never ending horse race and the women she smiled again and swirled her sherry yes indeed it might be interesting ive been knocking it around with carl for a couple of months hes the news director liv explained i think hed go for it if and when i can give him an outline and some firm names i suppose seeing amelia thaxter at the embassy started the wheels turning again a remarkable woman myra commented she smiled somewhat dismally as the fruit salad was placed in front of her she wasnt the sort of woman who liked moderation even gastronomically as dedicated as they come and quite devoted to her constituents quite sincerely devoted she made a choice between marriage and a career long ago some women cant mix the two she smiled at liv then and plunged her fork into a chunk of pineapple oh im not talking out of school shed tell you herself if asked i believe shell be quite interested in your project yes and margerite lewellyn nothing she likes better than to talk about herself then theres barbara carp liv listened not touching her own lunch as myra rattled off names of women political figures and the wives of some of washingtons top brass this was a great deal more than she had expected and as she spoke myra became more animated with the idea what fun she concluded i believe youll do a marvelous job of it i think ill make a few phone calls when i get back i appreciate it liv began hardly knowing what to say really i oh fiddle myra waved away the thanks with her fork it sounds a great deal more fun than planning another dinner party besides she gave liv another of those blinding smiles i fully expect to be interviewed myself that is an opportunity i wouldnt miss for the world liv said sincerely myra liv said and applied herself to her own salad you are amazing i do try to be now thats all the business nicely settled she gave a selfsatisfied sigh she liked this girl oh yes she liked this girl very much and when myra ditmyer made up her mind about someone it was as firm as one of her husbands court decisions i must tell you i had no idea when i made that little arrangement about the bridge party that you and greg knew each other i love being surprised he was a very good friend liv poked at her salad seeing him again was good for me myra watched her carefully i said i was surprised but then she saw livs eyes rise to hers it didnt take me long to put the pieces together when he was in college greg had written me often about livvy i remember hoping he was enjoying a nice sweet romance he was certainly captivated by her myra i no no now let me finish greg was always a faithful correspondent so refreshing in a young man he wrote me that his livvy was involved with his roommate it was all so long ago my dear myra placed a hand on hers i apologize but greg was very intimate in his letters i suppose he needed a sounding board for his feelings they were quite real to him at the time he was desperately in love with you and as close to doug as a man can be to another being in the middle was difficult for him and perhaps because i was removed he talked to me through his letters he told me everything the look the press of the hand told liv that myra was being literal there must be nothing about those years that she didnt know liv stared at her helplessly now dear have some more wine i dont mean to upset you we all learn to cope dont we she went on in an easy voice as liv obeyed her to live with loss and pain and disappointment one cant have lived to my age and not have run the gamut it must have been dreadful for you you probably thought youd never live through it no liv murmured no i was sure i wouldnt but you have myra patted her hand again leaned back and waited perhaps it was myras skill in dealing with people perhaps her genuine interest in them that caused liv to respond to myras silence more than she would have to a dozen wellmeaning questions i thought for a while it would be better to die than to have to live with the pain there didnt seem to be anybody my family she said on a long breath i suppose they tried in their way they were sympathetic but she stopped and let out a quiet sigh that tugged at myras heart i wanted to scream i wanted to tear something apart anything they simply never understood that kind of need a persons grief a persons private torment should be just that private it should be handled with dignity poppycock myra said rudely when youre hurt you cry and the hell with anyone who doesnt like to see tears liv laughed i believe i could have used you then i might not have made such a botch of things its entirely your own opinion that you did myra said sternly it might be time for you to give yourself a bit more credit but as ive said youve lived through it and this is today tell me about you and tc oh liv looked down at her salad again in fresh bewilderment what was there to say shed botched things again i can hardly hold any hope that you and greg will make a match of it she saw liv smile at that and continued but as tcs one of my favorite people ive decided to be content with that im not ever going to marry again oh what boring nonsense myra said goodnaturedly tc and you have been seeing each other fairly regularly now havent you yes but liv frowned a bit myra really had missed her calling hes entirely too intelligent a man to let you slip through his fingers id bet herberts prize golf clubs that hes already asked you to marry him well no that is he told me i was going to but much more in character myra said pleased oh yes thats just like him and of course that got your back up he was so unbearably arrogant liv stated remembering and he loves you so dreadfully that stopped her she could only stare olivia a blind man could have seen it that night at my little bridge game and my eyesights very keen what are you doing about it ive liv felt herself deflate like a pricked balloon ive ruined it last night myra studied her in silence a moment really she thought the child was so confused again she reached out to pat her hand it was such a shame to see people waste time because they thought too much and acted too little you know unlike the maxim life isnt short olivia its really terribly long she smiled at the serious eyes on her face but not nearly long enough ive been married to herbert for thirtyfive years if i had listened to my parents bless them and my own better sense i would never have married a man who seemed too stuffy who was too old for me and entirely too work oriented think of all i would have missed life she said positively is worth a few risks to prove it she added and sat back im going to have some of that lemon mousse even hours later preparing for broadcast liv couldnt get myras words out of her mind it was time to do something she decided in the middle of the sportscasters report time to stop mulling things over point by point if she wanted to be with thorpe she was going to have to tell him so the moment her broadcast was over liv went upstairs seeing her approach the receptionist gave a fatalistic sigh hes not here she said as she prepared to pack up her work for the day hes doing his report on location ill wait in his office liv breezed by before the other woman could comment what am i going to say to him liv asked herself the moment she shut the door behind her what can i say pacing the room she tried to find words it seemed odd to be there without him the room was so much his scattered on one wall were pictures of him with various world leaders and government officials he looked invariably relaxed never stiff never overawed he was simply thorpe liv mused and that was enough there were scrawled notes littering his desk and a hefty pile of papers held down by a paperweight she went to look out at his view of the city she could see the dome of the capitol with the sun beginning to set it had a rosy hue almost fairylike traffic was thick but the heavy glass insulated her from the sound of it she gazed out at the lines and circles of the streets the old stately buildings the cherry blossoms just coming to bloom it didnt have the movement or urgency of new york she decided but was beautiful in its way engrossed in her study she never heard thorpe come in seeing her surprised him he was uncustomarily thrown offbalance he hesitated for a moment with his hand still on the knob very carefully he shut the door at his back liv she whirled and he saw her expression range from surprise to pleasure to controlled anxiety more than he had ever wanted anything thorpe wanted to take her into his arms and pretend the night had never happened thorpe at the sight of him all her planned speeches flew out of her head she stood rooted to the spot i hope you dont mind that i just came in he lifted a brow and she saw it the light mockery the easy amusement of course not want some coffee he was so casual as he strolled over to the pot she began to wonder if she had imagined that less than twentyfour hours before he had told her he loved her no i i came by to see if youd come to dinner she said impulsively she could sense refusal and hurried on while his back was still to her of course i cant promise a meal like you could fix but i wont poison you thorpe abandoned the making of coffee and turned to face her liv i dont think its a good idea he said quietly thorpe she turned away for a moment to gather strength what she wanted to do was weep and to use his shoulder to weep on that wouldnt help either of them she turned to face him again there are so many things you dont know dont understand but i want you to know and to understand that i care i care very much maybe more than im able to deal with he could hear the nerves rushing through her voice as she took a step toward him i know its a tremendous thing to ask but if you could just give me some time it was costing her he noted to ask knowing her he understood it had cost her to come to him this way hadnt he told himself to be patient i have some things to clear up here first he said would it be all right if i came by in an hour or so he heard her small expulsion of breath good an hour later liv was wound up tight she tried to bank her nerves and concentrate on getting together a meal but her eyes were forever fixing themselves on the clock maybe i should change she thought and glanced down at her nononsense suit of charcoal gray even as she headed from the kitchen the doorbell rang liv jolted oh stop being ridiculous she chided herself but when she answered the door her heart was thumping hi she gave him a bright smile that was a little strained around the edges your timings good ill put the steaks on in a minute she shut the door behind her and was already wondering what to do with her hands steaks about the safest i cant do too much to ruin it would you like a drink im rambling she thought good god and he was looking at her again in that calm steady way she went to the bar without waiting for his answer she could use one even if he couldnt do you want scotch she asked pouring first from the vermouth decanter for herself she felt his hands on her shoulders she didnt resist when he turned her didnt lower her eyes when his looked into hers without speaking he simply gathered her close and held her with a shuddering sigh she clung to him and felt the tension flow from her oh thorpe i nearly went crazy without you i need you that in itself was an awesome admission they both held on to it liv lifted her face to his dont go she murmured dont go tonight she pressed her mouth to his the world focused for her again make love to me she whispered now thorpe right now his mouth still on hers he lowered her to the couch he touched her gently feeling the shape of her through her clothes her body was pliant willing to be explored her breath trembled on his tongue with unbearable softness he kissed her again and again until liv felt the total capitulation of mind body spirit she felt no aching drive no desperation only a warm liquifying surrender he undressed her slowly layer by layer piece by piece letting his fingertips linger on the point of her breast on the curve of her hip liv sighed and relinquished everything he was in command to take her wherever he wished his touch was light almost reverent as he stroked her even when he wandered to the heated skin of her inner thighs he moved without hurry she began to shudder to arch under him but he lingered only briefly at her moist center before roaming on he teased the tip of her breast with his tongue then stopped to savor liv felt the passion shoot from the sensitive skin he tasted to the pit of her stomach it pulled at her until her movements were less languid but he wouldnt be rushed his mouth took the same slow aching journey his fingertips had over and over her while her skin hummed then quivered then flashed with heat she heard herself calling him in a voice that was rough with needs her body was no longer passive but crying out for him only him he took her but slowly while she clung to him mindlessly a breath away from heaven then his mouth was on hers and they rocketed through space together chapter contents prev next hey thorpe nuzzled livs neck to wake her going to sleep all day she snuggled closer umhum she kept her eyes shut the feel of his body against her was all that she wanted at the moment it could be night or morning or afternoon she didnt care its after nine he ran his hand down her back and heard her quiet sigh of pleasure were going to spend the day in a boat remember liv let her eyes open to slits it was morning she discovered saturday morning and he was with her with a sleepy smile she tilted her face back to his lets spend it in bed instead the womans lazy he decided and beautiful he thought as he brushed the hair from her cheek so achingly beautiful lazy livs left brow arched ive masses of untapped energy her voice was slow and heavy as she shut her eyes again masses she repeated and yawned oh yes i can see that should we go to the mall and jog first she opened her eyes again oh ive a much better idea he hadnt expected the kiss to be so ardent or her move to be so quick she was suddenly lying across his chest with her mouth on his his sound of pleasure was muffled then she touched him his pulse jumped from an easy rhythm to a racing pace in the space of seconds his blood cool from the nights rest flamed headily her hands were urgent unexpectedly aggressive her mouth hungry on his skin he was caught up in her quickly before he could fully register that she was leading him his instant response seemed to fill her with power her mouth was greedy on his demanding and drawing then roaming on to his neck his throat his shoulders her tongue darted out tracing over his chest lingering over his nipples and then on when did she become so strong he wondered dazed or was he suddenly weak he needed to have her now now he could feel the blood pounding in his head in his loins in his fingertips pleasure was a pain clawing at his stomach but when he tried to roll her over she shifted straddling him and crushing his mouth with her own he was suffocating but he pulled her closer she was in his lungs in his pores her movements on top of him were driving him mad then he was inside her sanity shattered the world exploded he could hear the thunder of it roaring inside his head until he thought he would never hear anything else then it was livs breathing short shallow she seemed to melt onto him as the strength seeped from her he shuddered once then cradled the back of her head in his hand my woman he thought almost fiercely as she rested against him still trembling he let himself lie still until the intensity passed there was still a need to be cautious i suppose you want an apology hmm he could hear the bafflement in the sigh for calling you lazy liv laughed and clung to him then shifted to his side it does seem to be in order she agreed and prepared to snuggle again you can give it to me when i wake up oh no rising thorpe grabbed her and hauled her unceremoniously unsympathetically from the bed rowing he said as she tried to scowl at him youre an obsessed man absolutely he smiled before he kissed her nose ill let you have the shower first thanks her gratitude seemed a trifle mordant but he grinned at her as she shut the bathroom door behind her thorpe slipped on his slacks and gave an idle thought to fixing coffee instead he reached for the pack of cigarettes that lay on the table beside the bed from there he could hear liv humming as she started up the water for her shower picking up his lighter thorpe flicked it and got spark but no flame mildly annoyed he glanced around for matches then opened the narrow drawer in the table thinking he might find some there the photograph caught his eye immediately it drew his attention first because livs apartment was so conspicuously bare of photos or personal mementos and second because the child smiling back at him was strikingly beautiful lifting it out he studied it it was a small snapshot framed in silver the boy was hardly more than a year old full in the cheeks and grinning broadly his thatch of black hair was thick and left to fall around his face in a style that suited the freewheeling smile the eyes were dark dark blue nearly cobalt and filled with a mixture of mischief and delight here was a child a stranger on the street would stop to smile at a child aunts and uncles would have to spoil you could almost hear the laughter that was ready to burst through the grin with the photo still in his hand thorpe sat on the bed i hope i used all the hot water liv said from behind the door it would serve you right for dragging me out of bed at the crack of dawn on a saturday she opened the door and stood for a minute looking down as she belted her robe i dont smell any coffee the least you can do when her voice trailed off as she looked up and saw what thorpe held in his hand he watched the laughter and color flow from her face liv he started to explain the hunt for the matches then stopped the words would hardly matter even if they penetrated who is he thorpe could count a full ten seconds before her eyes lifted to his he watched her swallow saw her bottom lip tremble but when she spoke her voice was clear and strong my son he had known it the moment he had seen the photo the resemblance was unmistakable yet he felt a thud of shock at her answer keeping his eyes level he too spoke calmly where is he her face was dead white now he had never seen eyes so dark so full of thoughts and secrets and pain a ripple of emotion shook her hes dead quickly liv turned to the closet and began pulling out clothes she saw nothing more than a blur of colors she chose at random with hands that were too numb to shake even when she felt him take her shoulders she continued pushing at hangers and pulling out a blouse liv it took a firm hand to turn her i have to get dressed if were going she shook her head already warding off questions as she tried to break his grip stop it the command was curt and the shake he gave her was strong enough to draw a quick breath from her no dont do that not now not ever again not with me then before she could speak he pulled her against him and held her she might have withstood the command but he was offering comfort strength she leaned into him and her defenses crumbled come sit down he said and tell me about it with his arm still around her liv sat on the bed the snapshot lay beside her she picked it up and set it in her lap he didnt press her further sensing she needed a moment before she could begin i was nineteen when i met doug her viewers wouldnt have recognized her voice now it was small and hesitant and threaded with emotion he was studying law he had a scholarship he was a brilliant man very free spirited yet intense about what he was going to do he was going to be the best defense attorney in the country change the system from within the system challenge windmills fight dragons that was doug when he said nothing liv drew a deep breath and continued her voice grew stronger we were attracted to each other right away maybe partly because our backgrounds were so totally different and our ideals were so shiny we sparked something in each other and we were so young she sighed gathered strength and went on we married quickly less than three months after wed met my family with a little laugh she shook her head well leave it that they were surprised sometimes im afraid that might have been one of the reasons i married him i dont like to think it was she stared off into middle distance into her own memories for a moment thorpe felt cut off from her he shook the feeling off and continued to listen it wasnt the sturdiest marriage we were young and there were a lot of pressures college doug was cramming for exams i was interning at a local station and studying every spare minute money didnt matter much to either of us luckily because there wasnt a great deal of it we had some good times but doug was she let out a long breath as if searching for the proper words he had a weakness for women he loved me i really believe he did in his own way but he had a difficult time with fidelity none of his slips ever meant anything to him and i wasnt very sexually experienced thorpe found himself forced to choke words back he didnt want to interrupt her now that she was talking really talking but the urge to curse the man she had married was almost too powerful to resist he could remember very clearly her telling him the first time they had made love that she wasnt very good at pleasing a partner now at least he understood how the notion had been planted he kept quiet and listened we had joshua within the year hardly a year after we had first met my family thought we were mad starting a family so quickly and with an income far below what any of them could conceive trying to live on but we both wanted a baby we both wanted josh it seemed for a time hed center our lives he was so special her eyes fell to the photo in her lap i know all mothers think that about their babies but he was so beautiful so goodnatured he hardly ever cried she saw the tear fall onto the glass of the frame and squeezed her eyes shut we both adored him it was impossible not to for almost a year we were happy really really happy doug was a tremendous father no job was too small or too demeaning i remember once he woke me up absolutely beside himself with pride when he had discovered josh had cut a tooth liv said nothing for nearly a full minute thorpe didnt want to prompt her he understood her need to continue at her own pace keeping his arm around her he waited after i had graduated we moved to new jersey doug had a position with a small law firm and i had landed a job with wtrl i had the night desk at first it wasnt easy on either of us we were both just starting out taking career crumbs working obscene hours raising the baby between us i dont think josh suffered it certainly didnt seem so he was such a happy baby i was with him all day doug took over in the evening and put him to bed then there was an incident with a law clerk doug was attracted to a small slip he hadnt had one in a year i overlooked it she shrugged tried to overlook it she corrected herself he blamed himself enough for it in any case we tried to put things back together we had the baby to think of nothing was more important to either one of us than josh finally i got off the night shift and onto days i started reading the weather and doing a few minor reports we spent a lot of time finding a sitter who satisfied both of us even then we disagreed doug wanted me to stop working and stay home with josh i wouldnt do it she pressed her fingers to her eyes a moment then laid them back in her lap he was so well adjusted so content i loved him more than anything else in the world but it didnt seem necessary or even wise for me to stop work give up my career to be with him every minute there were financial considerations and my own needs and i didnt want to smother him her voice lost its strength and started to waver it was so tempting to just stay with him spoil him doug used to say if i had my way i would have kept him a baby forever i always thought he was trying to make josh grow up too quickly it was really sweet the way hed buy him a football and talk about twowheelers when josh was only eighteen months old but then he bought this huge swing set on joshs second birthday it terrified me all those high bars we argued about it a bit not seriously he laughed and called my overprotective then i laughed because doug had been the one to research car seats for three weeks before hed bought one if id if id stuck to my instincts everything might have been different liv stared down at the picture a moment then she pressed it to her breast the sitter called me at work to tell me josh had taken a tumble from the swing just a bump on the head she said but i dropped everything called doug and rushed home hed gotten there even before i had josh seemed fine but both of us were panicked we took him straight to the emergency room at the hospital i remember sitting there while he was being xrayed this big room with all these black plastic chairs metal ashtrays and overhead lights the floor tile was black with white speckles in it i counted them and doug paced when the doctor came out he took us both into this little room he had a gentle voice it terrified me i could see it in his eyes before he said anything but i wouldnt believe it it wasnt possible she pressed her hand to her mouth to try to keep the sobs from breaking through every detail was flooding back over her and with them all the pain i didnt believe it when he told us josh had thrown an embolism he was gone just like that liv rocked back and forth the photo pressed close as the sobs began to tear at her throat i dont even know what happened then i got hysterical they sedated me the next thing i remember clearly was being at home doug was devastated we couldnt seem to do each other any good instead we lashed out we said terrible things he blamed me for not staying home watching our child caring for him if i had been there then maybe and i clawed back hed bought the swing set the damned swing set that had killed my baby liv he wanted to wipe it all out the pain the grief even the memories she had the photo pressed against her breast as if she would try to bring it to life with her own heartbeat what comfort could he offer not words there werent any he could only hold her she dashed at the tears in her eyes as thorpe drew her closer now that it was coming out it was far from finished she was functioning only on emotion now and it had to run its course greg came he was joshs godfather our closest friend god knows we needed somebody our world had just fallen apart he kept us from hurting each other more but the damage was done josh was dead she gave a long sigh that rippled through her and had her shoulders trembling under his arm he was dead and nothing could change it there wasnt any blame an accident just an accident she was silent for a long time he could sense she was gathering her strength to continue he wanted the pain to stop wanted to help her close it off in the past where it had to stay but even before he could speak she continued greg took care of the arrangements the funeral i wasnt coping with it well they were giving me something i dont even know what it was that first week doug and i were like zombies my family came but they didnt know me they hadnt known josh as i had every day i expected to walk by his room and hear him playing i went back to work because i couldnt bear staying in the house waiting for him to wake up the tears were flowing as she spoke her voice was raw with grief whatever thorpe had expected to find beneath the guards it hadnt been this she was blind with it now he didnt think she was aware of him any longer or the arm that kept her close the marriage was over we both knew it but we couldnt seem to bring ourselves to say the words it was as if we were both thinking that if we hung on hed come back we were polite to each other tiptoeing around i wanted someone to hold on to someone to tell me i dont know what words i needed to hear but he didnt have them i dont suppose i had them for him we shared the same bed and never touched each other we lived like that for over a month once i once i asked him to come into joshs room with me to help me help me sort through his things i knew i couldnt do it alone and that it had to be done he left the house and didnt come back all night he couldnt face it and i couldnt face it alone i had to call greg and we she pressed the heel of her hand to her forehead and tried not to choke over the words doug and i never spoke of it again then melinda came my sister shed been fond of josh she used to send him useless expensive little toys her being there seemed to help for a while she was a distraction she made us get out of the house forced us to entertain her and keep our minds off everything i think it helped me because i began to realize that doug and i were only hurting each other by keeping up the pretense of being married we had to stop i decided to ask for a divorce before one of us did something unforgivable it wasnt easy i thought about it for days i came home early one afternoon because i wanted to have a little time to sort out what i would say id made up my mind to talk to doug that night when i got there dougs car was in the drive i thought he might have been ill and come home when i went upstairs i found him in bed with my sister very gently she laid the photo back in her lap it was the final blow my sister my home my bed i left before either of them could say anything i didnt want to hear i didnt want to say the horrible things that i knew id say if i waited i went to a motel thats when i made up my mind that my parents had been right all along if you live calmly without disturbing your life with emotional attachments you cant be hurt thats how i was going to live from that moment no one nothing was ever going to take me to that point again id had enough pain i filed for divorce right away doug asked greg to handle it for me i never even spoke to him again except through greg after a while i began to realize that doug had just taken the step before i had hed used melinda to end something that was killing both of us that made it easier to forgive him and because wed had and lost something extraordinary together on the last word she began to weep passionately uncontrollably as she turned into thorpe his arms cradled her to hold her until the grief passed chapter contents prev next there was the faintest of breezes over the water it rippled over the reflections in the potomac and just stirred livs hair now that they were there stretched out under the sky thorpe was glad he had persuaded liv to come the sun and the activity would be good for her another woman he thought would have wanted to sleep off the strain of that much weeping not liv she was still pale her eyes showed traces of the tears they had spent but there was an unmistakable aura of strength about her thorpe admired her for it even as he loved her for it now he felt he could understand why she had iced herself over he had seen the face of the boy in the photograph a face full of life and undiluted joy he ached for her for her loss it was difficult for him to imagine liv married having a son building a life with another man a small house in the suburbs a fenced yard toys under the sofa all of that seemed a world apart from the woman who sat across from him now and yet that had been her life not so many years before it could be her life again this time with him thorpe wanted it for her and for himself more than ever he knew there would be a need to move slowly with her she was strong yes but she had been terribly hurt doug he thought and experienced one moment of blazing anger he didnt forgive as easily as liv the man as he saw it had done more than lose liv through his own weaknesses he had scarred her now it was up to thorpe to show her convince her that he meant to stand beside her always from where liv sat she could watch thorpe row his muscles rippled there seemed to be no effort in the skill and strength he used to guide the boat over the river he wasnt a man who had to flex his biceps to prove he was strong or masculine he knew himself and his confidence came from that knowledge so she had told him years had gone by since she had opened herself like that to anyone there was nothing he didnt know about her now why had she told him perhaps she mused because she had known or hoped he would still be there when she had finished and he had been no questions no advice only support he had known what she needed when had she discovered what an unusual man he was and why had it taken her so long she felt relaxed and safe and more at ease with herself than she could remember the tears and the telling had purged the pain for a moment she closed her eyes and let her body enjoy the cleansing of her mind i havent thanked you she said into the quiet for what he brought the oars up and back in a long steady stroke for being there and for not saying all those tidy little words people say when someone falls apart you were hurting his eyes were on hers again looking deep nothing i could say can erase what happened or make it easier but im here now i know liv sighed and leaned back i know they rowed for a time in silence there were other boats here and there dotting the river but they didnt come close enough to exchange waves or greetings it might have been their own private stream in their own private world its still early enough in the spring thorpe said that the river isnt crowded i like to come at dawn in the summer when the lights just breaking its amazing how quiet all those buildings look at sunrise you can forget therell be throngs of tourists tramping up the monument or packing into the smithsonian at dawn its hard to think about whats going on in the pentagon or the capitol theyre just buildings rather unique sometimes beautiful on a saturday or sunday when i havent got a story weighing me down i can just row and forget all the times ive climbed the stairs ridden the elevators and opened the doors in all those buildings funny liv mused a month or two ago i would have been surprised to hear you say that i pictured you as a man with one driving ambition totally focused on his job and his job alone i never would have imagined you needing to get away from it to separate yourself from the pace he smiled and continued to stroke steadily through the water and now and now i know you she sat up and let the wind catch her hair when did you discover that rowing was your alternative to ulcer pills he laughed both amused and pleased you do know me when i got back from the middle east it was hard over there it was hard coming back i imagine most soldiers feel the same way adjusting to normality isnt always easy i started working out my frustrations this way and found it became a habit it suits you liv decided the understated physicality she grinned as he arched a brow i dont imagine its as simple as you make it look want to give it a try she smiled and settled back oh thats all right im better at spectator sports it doesnt take much coordination he added her eyes which had begun to close opened again any kid with a week at summer camp can manage it he was baiting her purposefully he wanted to see that gleam of competition back in her eyes im sure i could manage it just fine come on then he invited and locked the oars give it a try she wasnt at all certain she wanted to but the challenge was difficult to avoid do you really think we should switch around i wouldnt like to capsize in the middle of the potomac the boats well balanced he said easily if you are she stood up at that though warily all right thorpe move aside they changed positions with a minimum of fuss thorpe settled down on the small cushioned seat and watched liv grip the oars dont put a lot of power into it he advised as she struggled for a moment to unlock them just keep it as smooth as you can i went to summer camp she said sweetly then scowled as her arms refused to coordinate with each other but then usually we used canoes im great with a paddle there she managed one shaky but reasonable stroke now ill get my rhythm take that smirk off your face thorpe she added and put all her concentration into her task liv could feel twinges from muscles she hadnt put to use in years it was a good cleansing feeling she could count to eight with each stroke and feel her shoulders strain then give with the movement the oars scraped against her palms oh yes she thought i can see why he does it they were moving not as cleanly as before but moving nonetheless through the water under her power there was no engine no sail no dependence on anything but her own effort her body her will and the oars yes she understood exactly what he meant she believed she could have rowed for miles okay carmichael times up are you kidding i just got started she sent him a grim look and kept rowing ten minutes is enough the first time out besides he scooted across to her when she paused i dont want you to ruin your hands i like them the way they are i like yours taking his palm she pressed it to her cheek liv it was impossible to believe he could love her more at that moment than he had the moment before yet he did locking the oars he drew her close to his side it was late afternoon before they walked back into livs apartment building each carried a paper sack filled with groceries i know how to roast a chicken liv insisted pushing the button for her floor you put it in the oven and turn it on for a couple of hours nothing to it please he gave her a pained look it might hear you he cradled the sack that held the chicken more protectively theres an art to these things liv seasoning timing preparation if a chickens going to give up its life for your consumption the least you can do is have a little respect i dont think i like the tone of this conversation she glanced dubiously at his grocery bag why dont we just send out for pizza im going to show you what a master can do with a twopound roaster thorpe waited until they had stepped out of the elevator and then im going to make love to you until sunday morning oh liv gave this a moments thought and struggled with a pleased smile only till then until very late sunday morning he added stopping to kiss her before she could locate her keys maybe he murmured against her mouth until very early sunday afternoon im beginning to appreciate the idea of this cooking lesson a bit more he let his lips wander to her ear im beginning to appreciate the idea of sending out for pizza later his mouth came back to hers much much later lets go inside and take a vote mmm i like your thinking its the washington influence she told him as she slipped her key into the lock theres no issue that cant be resolved with a vote tell that to the senators who are waiting for donahue and his filibuster to run out of steam she laughed and turned the knob ill tell you something thorpe she said as she closed the door behind them i dont want to think about senators or filibusters she shifted the bag in her arm so that she could bring her body close to his i dont even want to think about that twopound roaster youre so crazy about no his free arm came around her why dont you tell me what you do want to think about with a smile she began to undo the buttons of his shirt why dont i show you instead a good video reporter knows that actions worth a thousand words he felt her cool long fingers roam down his chest he set down his bag then took hers and let it lean against the closed door ive always said carmichael youre a hell of a reporter her laugh was smothered against his mouth it was late sunday evening liv sat close to thorpe on the sofa the entire weekend she thought had been like a dream she had shared with him more than she had ever intended to share with anyone but then he had come to mean more to her than she had intended to allow anyone to mean to her again last night theyd laughed through the cooking and eating of dinner it was so easy to laugh with him so easy when she was with him to forget all the vows she had once made he loved her the knowledge still staggered her this tough relentless man loved her hed shown her gentleness and understanding traits she had needed but had never thought to find in him how different her life would have been if she had found him all those years ago but no liv closed her eyes that would be like wishing joshua out of existence she wouldnt give up the memory of those brief years for anything hed been the focus of her world her child perhaps because her time with him had been concentrated into two short years she could remember almost every detail of it loving like that was the greatest wonder a woman could know and the greatest danger shed promised herself never to experience it again now there was thorpe what sort of life would she have with him what sort would she have without him both of the questions and their answers frightened her already she thought as her head stayed nestled on his shoulder hes gotten close enough to frighten me im not certain i can turn back now im not certain i can go ahead if things could go on just as they are but the time was fast approaching when she would have to make a move one way or the other he knows what he wants she mused there isnt a doubt in his mind i wish i could see things as clearly youre quiet he murmured i know yesterday mornings catching up with you he wanted to draw her closer to make her forget but forgetting wasnt the answer for either of them it couldnt have been easy for you talking it all through feeling it all again no it wasnt easy she tilted her head to look up at him her face was in shadows but her eyes were clear on his but im glad it happened im glad you know thorpe she let out a little breath it was becoming more and more important that he know everything there was a time right after josh died that i wanted to die too i didnt want to live without him i couldnt conceive of living without him there wasnt enough strength in me to do anything solid about it but if i could have died just closed my eyes and died i would have liv he lifted a hand to her cheek i cant pretend to know what its like to lose a child that kind of grief cant be understood by anyone who hasnt experienced it i didnt die she continued swallowing i ate i slept i functioned but i buried part of myself with josh what was left i smothered when i divorced doug it seemed the only way to survive ive lived this way a long time without considering any changes but you didnt die liv his hand slipped down to cup her chin his eyes were direct on hers and changes are a part of living have you ever loved someone completely just you he said simply oh thorpe liv pressed her face against his shoulder emotion squeezed her heart the words came so easily to him and the feelings she wasnt certain she was strong enough yet to accept them i need you it scares me to death she lifted her face again and her eyes were eloquent i know what it is to lose im not sure i can survive a second time he was so close so close to having her he could feel it if he took her in his arms if he kissed her now he might urge the words he needed from her lips they were in her eyes it took every ounce of his control not to push not today he told himself shes given you enough this weekend needing someone he said carefully doesnt mean you have to lose them im trying to believe that she took a deep breath for the first time in five years i want to believe that it matters when i thought it never would again after a moment he lifted her hand and pressed the palm to his lips how much time do you want the tears came instantly silently she hadnt had to ask he had known he was giving her what she needed with no questions no demands i dont deserve you she shook her head i really dont thats my risk isnt it he smiled in my opinion i deserve you completely so that balances things i need to do some thinking she kissed him then held on i have to be alone because you make it hard for me to think do i he kissed her again all right he agreed pulling her with him as he rose but think fast tomorrow she held him close for another moment just until tomorrow the arms around her had such strength the man had so much to give oh god am i a fool thorpe yeah he drew her back to frame her face in his hands im a hell of a catch carmichael just remember that i will she murmured as he walked to the door he paused and turned back with his hand on the knob tomorrow tomorrow she repeated when she was alone chapter contents prev things were not as clear as liv would have liked them to be once before she had thought herself in love and she had been wrong what she had felt for doug had been the impulses and dreams of youth she was older now and more cautious perhaps too cautious she mused as she settled behind her desk yet when she told thorpe she loved him she wanted to say the words without any cloud of doubt he deserved that from her she didnt want to lose him that above all was crystal clear he had become the focal point of her life in a very short time dependence no she couldnt deny that she was dependent on him but was that love was it love when a man kept drifting into your mind when you began to associate the tiny details of your day with thoughts of him when you stored up the little pieces to share with him liv could remember what it was like to lie beside him in the morning the quiet the warmth the easy unity she could remember how a look in his eyes could make her tremble with need even in a crowded room was she in love with him why was she searching for another name for what she felt the truth had been locked inside her for days now it was time to accept it if she was going to ask thorpe to take a risk she had to be willing to take one herself love equaled vulnerability he could hurt her undoubtedly would from time to time the shield was gone now she would never be able to hide behind it again abruptly she realized she didnt want to what she wanted could be said in one word thorpe liv she turned to the frantic assignment editor with a brilliant smile yes chester it was going to be a beautiful day take a crew on the double new senate office building some guy unidentified is holding three hostages including senator wyatt in the senators office good god she was up grabbing a pad and her purse anybody hurt not yet as far as we know he added streaking toward carls office theres been some gunfire be careful we want a bulletin fast twenty minutes she was already out the door the capitol police had the building surrounded when liv arrived she glanced around for telltale signs of secret service men and fbi when you knew what to look for they stood out clearly on the rooftops of neighboring buildings she caught glimpses of sharpshooters taking position men armed with uglylooking guns were going over strategy and positions on twoways the press area was already partitioned off and jammed with reporters and technicians everyone was talking at once demanding answers trying to sneak their way through the barricade to secure a closer position liv pushed her way through and managed to get a mike out to a nearby uniformed officer olivia carmichael wwbw can you give us a rundown on whats happened do you have an identification on the man whos holding senator wyatt what are his demands hes a former aide thats all i can tell you thats all you will tell me liv corrected noting the flicker in his eye he hasnt made any demands yet how many weapons does he have how did he get inside the building we dont know were only sure about the handgun he isnt even answering the phone yet liv was left with little more than nothing in the midst of a pack of hungry reporters she had to find someone else with a looser tongue she could manage a quick bulletin but she was going to have to do a lot of digging to put anything solid on the air senator wyatt liv remembered him very well from the embassy party jovial pinkcheeked senator wyatt who had joked with her and told her to dance with thorpe she glanced across the street and studied the dozens of windows it didnt seem possible he was in one of those rooms with a gun held to his head on the edge of the crowd liv spotted a familiar face it was the receptionist who had kept her cooling her heels for two hours in an office two floors below senator wyatts only a few days before ms bingham liv blessed the two hours and the innumerable cups of coffee she had consumed in the womans office olivia carmichael wwbw oh ms carmichael isnt it dreadful she stared up at the windows with her eyes wide and stunned theyve cleared the whole building i just cant believe it poor senator wyatt do you know whos holding him its ed ed morrow who would have thought it why ive ridden in the elevator with him just dozens of times she lifted her hand to her throat at the memory i heard the senator had to let him go last week but why liv had the mike under her arm and was scribbling quickly on her pad the woman never seemed to notice im not sure rumor is ed got himself tangled up in gambling something illegal hes always so polite who would have thought it the senator fired him just last week she nodded quickly three times and her eyes were still wide he was supposed to clear out his desk today he must have gone crazy sally said he shot twice in the hallway sally the senators secretary she was just down the hall when it happened if she had been in the office she swallowed and fixed her eyes back on the building hes fired twice through the window since ive been out here do you think the senators going to be all right im sure hes going to be fine even as liv said the words the sharp report of gunfire split the air oh god the receptionist gripped livs arm is he killing them he must be killing them no no liv felt the cool lick of fear hes just shooting out of the window its going to be all right she had to corroborate the womans identifications of the gunman before she put it on the air that was the job one step at a time she couldnt think about what was happening to the people inside not yet is the senators secretary still here she had to go with the police shes back there somewhere all right thank you quickly liv began to work her way through the crowd again spying dutch she headed straight for him if anyone could give her the details he could it was closer to half an hour than the twenty minutes she had promised but liv delivered a straightforward detailed standup with pans of the police and the crowd the building across the street was quiet too quiet for her liking she would almost have preferred another volley of gunfire to the silence terror she realized abruptly was always silent when the hell is he going to do something bob muttered beside her the tension was seeping into them all police bystanders press everyone was waiting for the next move major league coming up he added theres tc ill be right back liv told him make sure the engineers ready to patch us into the station if anything goes down she made for thorpe like a homing pigeon heading for roost thorpe liv he touched her cheek briefly i figured youd be here is there anything new she asked knowing there was more than a story involved this time they both knew the man inside theyve established communications with morrow wyatts not hurt neither are the aides yet he doesnt seem to be quite rational one minute he wants a half million in cash and a plane the next gold and an armored car he changes his mind every time they talk to him how the hell did he get in there with a gun she demanded thorpe gave a quick mirthless laugh his eyes never left the building across the street it isnt difficult for someone securitys used to seeing to pass through he had it in his jacket i imagine or it was already in his desk he shifted impatiently liv could tell he wanted to move wanted to do something id feel better if he were a professional in the state hes in its too easy for him to make a mistake and take the hostages down with him he swore with a quiet urgency she rarely heard from him he wanted to make certain he was getting full media coverage you dont really think hes doing it for the publicity do you the thought appalled her thorpe shook his head ive dealt with him several times when ive set up meetings he took out a cigarette hes a taut hungry little man a good mind but the nerves show gambling im told so the stories go thorpe drew on the cigarette and let out a quick stream of smoke too quiet he muttered too damn quiet tension was palpable it increased almost visibly as the minutes dragged by how long she wondered could the taut hungry little man thorpe had described stand up under the strain hed taken an irrevocable step how much further would he go she waited like the others to find out thorpe liv recognized the man from the secret service and frowned when he singled thorpe out chief daniels wants you sure thorpe crushed another cigarette under his heel her too he added with a jerked thumb at liv were a team liv bit back a smile that was quite a change without a word she followed behind them the communications van was set up well away from the press area she glanced briefly at the equipment the tape recorders twoways phones the men working in shirt sleeves what could they want with thorpe she wondered this had nothing to do with the press chief daniels pushed his glasses back onto his weary face tc morrows demanding to speak to you directly you game sure the tapell be running be careful what you say if he makes any demands dont promise dont negotiate leave that to us he spoke quickly and without inflection but liv caught the undercurrents he didnt like this new twist youre not in a position to give him anything he wants hes smart enough to know that whatever he asks for you just tell him that youll check and get back to him understood understood he glanced at liv and focused in on her press badge shes with me thorpe told him easily none of this goes on the air until i give the word his eyes were hard and close to hostile were not going to give him a media freeforall understood liv said calmly then watched as thorpe was handed a receiver well ring daniels signaled one of his men keep him talking as long as you can if things start to get out of hand well take over thorpe nodded and heard morrow pick up the phone on the first ring tc yeah how you doing ed morrow laughed shakily terrific you going to do a report on me thats right you want to tell me why youre up there and what itll take to get you down you remember that day we sat in my office and talked about the birds when wyatt was held up in a meeting sure thorpe caught a glimpse of danielss grim face as he held a headset to his ear end of last summer the orioles were fighting for first place he drew out another cigarette and flicked on his lighter seen any games this year liv could hear the echo of the frantic laugh come through the receiver ive already dropped twentyfive big ones on games this year thats rough you need money thorpes eyes were locked on danielss now is that what you want for wyatts release ill tell you all about it tc but just you you come in and do one of your interviews right here ive got an exclusive for you liv could hear snatches and what she heard was enough to have her grabbing thorpes arm in panic ignoring her thorpe kept his eye on daniels too many hostages daniels said in an undertone thatll give you one more hostage ed thorpe replied easily doesnt seem like a very good deal no no i see your point morrows voice shook with nerves maybe ill send out the two aides for you if you tell me youre coming up youre as good as your word arent you tc two for one thorpe mused watching daniels steadily while liv gripped his arm tighter and shook her head but then the aides dont mean much do they there was a long pause liv could feel the sweat beginning to trickle down her back you come up alone no backup and ill send out wyatt hows that for a deal a onetime offer tc youre not going to turn down a scoop like this are you ill have to check back with the big shots at cnc ed give me ten minutes ill get back to you ten minutes morrow agreed and cut the connection liv grabbed thorpes jacket and turned him to face her no she shook her head frantically while her eyes mirrored her fear you cant you cant think of doing such a thing thorpe you cant hold on a minute his voice was calm and practical as he set her aside well he said simply to daniels number one we cant ask you to cooperate so youre not asking thorpe countered what then people i have to talk to before we consider making an exchange like his daniels rubbed a hand over his mouth he didnt like the taste of it but there was a senator involved touchy he thought very touchy then start talking to them thorpe suggested daniels sent him a long look youd better do some thinking while i do its not going to be a cozy interview thorpe livs voice quavered with panic she knew that look in his eyes no thorpe took her gently by the shoulders liv he began no no listen to me she gripped the front of his jacket its insane you cant just walk in there youre not trained for this sort of thing and whos to say hell let wyatt go when you do hell hell have more bargaining power then you must see that he wants to talk thorpe pointed out and started to lead her away wyatt cant get him national coverage i can oh god thorpe hes not stable she was weeping now and unaware of it hell kill you and the senator too you dont have to go they cant make you no ones making me he signaled a member of his crew and spoke in undertones call the desk tell them im going to do an interview with morrow in exchange for the hostages get a camera on the building in about ten minutes some of them should be coming out ill need a tape recorder no livs voice rose now in direct contrast to his she clutched at him as if she could hold him from what he intended to do you cant please listen to me liv he brushed the hair back from her face youd do the same thing its part of the job your life isnt worth a pulitzer he lifted a brow some might disagree with that damn it thorpe she had to think fast she had to be rational or hed never listen its probably just a trick he can let the two aides go and with you and wyatt hell have two important people he must realize that the network would negotiate for your release its just the sort of thing hes looking for maybe maybe not he kissed her then to quiet her and then because he needed to oh please dont go she clung to him knowing she had already lost and unable to accept it i love you slowly he reached up to take her shoulders and draw her back far enough to see her face it was tearstreaked and desperate i love you she repeated its tomorrow thorpe stay with me god he rested his forehead on hers and let the feeling seep through him he pulled her close again bruisingly close your timing carmichael is incredible when he kissed her again he felt her lips tremble under his were going to talk about this later were going to talk about it for a long time he drew her away and smiled at her youd better give your station the latest developments or youre going to find yourself scooped why wont you listen to me she was angry now as well as desperate even her love hadnt swayed him you cant go in there i need you she didnt care if the words were unfair as long as they prevented him from crossing the street i need you too liv that doesnt have anything to do with me doing my job or with you doing yours she didnt want logic she only wanted him she clutched at him fiercely im going to marry you he smiled again and kissed her nose ive known that for months youre just a bit slow glancing up he noted the camera pointing in their direction and now several hundred thousand people know it too i dont care her penchant for privacy seemed suddenly absurd thorpe you cant ask me to face losing you she grabbed the lapels of his jacket in hands that were damp with fear damn you i cant face it i cant face it all again i wont his grip was firmer now and his eyes intense you listen to me i love you more than anything dont you forget it we live with risk every day if we dont were already dead it hurts to be alive liv pale and calm she faced him ill never forgive you if you do this i never wanted to love you now that i do youre asking me to stand by and wait to lose you i wont forgive you for that he watched her steadily he saw the pain and the panic he didnt want to hurt her he would have done anything in this power to keep that look from her eyes but he couldnt alter who he was or what he was maybe you should think about who you fell in love with olivia i havent changed im exactly as i was and exactly as ill be tomorrow now ive got a job to do so do you thorpe come on he cut her off and began to lead her back daniels should have finished talking to his people by now liv stood back and watched helpless as thorpe daniels and morrow made the final negotiations for the exchange there was nothing she could say nothing she could do to stop him he had told her she would do the same thing she understood it but it didnt matter he was her love her life everything that was important to her was bound up in him its not fair she thought on a fresh surge of desperation shed been given her second chance now she had to stand back and watch while it was put on the line myras words played back in her head lifes not short but its never long enough thorpe her whole being cried out to him while she dug her teeth into her lip to keep silent dont go i have so much to say to you so much time to make up for she wanted to tell him what he meant to her how he had opened up everything she had closed thorpe was checking the tape recorder as he listened to danielss instructions liv watched them her eyes blinded by tears oh thorpe she thought i cant face the emptiness again not now that i know what it is to have you i need to know youre there when i reach out i want to love again to hold your child in my arms oh please dont shut me off when ive just started to feel with a deep shuddering breath she pressed her fingers to her eyes she watched him again the sharp athletic profile the deep intense eyes is he frightened whats going on in his mind is he remembering that none of us is indestructible but you have to be thorpe for me for us what does he need from me not this she realized abruptly he needs support not a hysterical woman pulling at him begging him to think of her he needs his wits about him now if only i could go with him but i cant i cant go with him but i can send something with him as she watched the two aides were hustled out of the building and out of range so morrow had kept the first part of the bargain there was only wyatt now thorpe for wyatt drawing on all her strength liv stepped up to him thorpe he turned to her there were still tears on her cheeks but he recognized the control you always did go out of your way to scoop me on a story she managed in a reasonably steady voice i hope this ones worth it you better do a hell of a job in there i need the copy for my broadcast he grinned as he kissed her just dont step too close to my turf carmichael liv clung for one last moment catch my report at fivethirty ive always been fond of you tc daniels commented and it seems this lady is too he gave thorpe a long look youve still got time to back out thorpe walk away from an exclusive liv pulled back and ordered herself not to shake you dont know him very well you he pulled liv back a last time think about where you want to spend your honeymoon i lean toward paris you warned me you were a romantic then he was turning preparing to cross the street thorpe liv couldnt prevent herself from calling out when he turned she held back the plea and smiled at him if you get yourself killed the deals off he grinned tonight we send out for pizza ill be back he was gone quickly swallowed up by the building the waiting began thorpe had a pretty good idea of what he should do the questions were already forming in his head as he rode the elevator with an armed guard the trick would be to keep morrow pacified at ease talking keep him talking he fully intended to come out in one piece lebanon had taught him a few things hed ridden this elevator before countless times it was part of the routine hadnt alex haley interviewed rockwell while the american nazi leader had played with a gun and that had been a hell of an interview reporters couldnt always choose the sane and the reasonable the elevator opened and he started down the hall the tickle at the back of his neck told him there were more guns he ignored them and knocked on wyatts outer office tc he heard morrows voice strung out with nerves yeah im alone come in slow ive got a good view of the door thorpe did as he was instructed morrow stood in the archway to wyatts inner office with his gun held to the senators head tc wyatts normally florid face was gray youve got to be crazy how are you senator hes fine morrow snapped his eyes darting behind thorpe shut the door and step away from it when thorpe obeyed he signaled him with a jerk of his head to come forward he eyed the tape recorder set it down and take off your jacket no weapons ed thorpe said easily as he carefully stripped off his jacket just the tape recorder we made a deal he gave wyatt an apologetic smile youll have to excuse us senator ed and i have a private interview yeah morrow stared at thorpe a moment then loosened his hold on wyatt yeah you can go tc i said you can go morrows voice lifted so did the gun hes here for me this time sorry senator thorpes voice was calm and unruffled his fingertips were prickling as he watched the gun hand tremble ed and i have a lot to discuss well set something up later with a nod wyatt started to turn no morrow stopped him with the word he licked his lips then ran the back of his hand over them you back up all the way out thorpe waited as wyatt followed morrows instructions there was fear in the room he could all but taste it it didnt lessen even after the door closed behind wyatt morrow stood a moment staring at the door thorpe didnt want him to start thinking too carefully all right he said and took a seat lets get started he turned on the tape recorder outside liv watched the building steadily everything but her mind was numb she couldnt feel her hands her feet she knew there was activity all around her in the communications van in the press area things were starting to hum her mind was focused on one thing thorpe thorpe kept his questions brief he wanted as little emotion as possible ed it might be more comfortable for both of us if you he made a gesture with his hand palm lowered to indicate the gun morrow glanced at it then shifted the revolver until it was no longer aimed at thorpes chest thanks obviously you chose wyatts office because you worked here he went on did you feel the senator was unjust in letting you go hes clean as a whistle you know morrow answered couldnt blackmail him god i needed the money in deep tc too damn deep i thought about juggling some funds but i didnt have enough time he found out about the gambling about the people ive been dealing with not the senators kind of people he laughed in a quick nervous giggle and shifted the gun again it was pointed back at thorpe but morrow didnt notice i thought id get something for taking him hostage but theyd never let me get away with it would they the look he gave thorpe was lost and fatalistic id be a dead man before i got my hands on the money thorpe changed the line of questioning a man with nothing to lose was the most dangerous how much are you in for seventyfive thousand the phone rang and morrow jerked up the gun was pointed at thorpes head fifteen minutes ed thorpe reminded him calmly we arranged for me to check in every fifteen minutes right someone pushed a cup of coffee into livs hand she never tasted it thorpes voice came suddenly low and calm from behind her through the machines in the van jolting she dropped the cup coffee splashed warm around her ankles you cant stand here and do nothing she told herself steadying do your job turning she went back to her crew to send out the next live bulletin thirty minutes crawled into sixty the office was stuffy thorpe knew he was dragging out the interview all had been said but his instincts told him morrow wasnt ready yet the man was slouched in his chair his eyes filmy there was a thin bead of sweat over his top lip and a muscle twitched in his left cheek sporadically but the gun was still in his hand youre not married are you tc no carefully thorpe drew out a cigarette offering one to morrow morrow shook his head got a woman yeah thorpe lit the cigarette and thought of liv cool hands cool voice yeah ive got a woman i had a wife kids too the film in the eyes became tears she packed up and left last week ten years she said ten years was long enough to wait for me to keep my promises i swore to her i wouldnt gamble anymore tears rolled down to mix with the sweat he wiped neither away i always swore i wouldnt gamble anymore but i needed to get even you know what they do to you when you cant get even he shuddered there are people who can help you ed why dont we go outside i know some people help morrow sighed on the word thorpe didnt like the sound of it no help now tc i crossed the line he looked up and stared into thorpes eyes a man should know whats going to happen when he crosses the line he raised the gun again and thorpe felt his heart stop you make sure morrow sobbed i get my airtime before thorpe could move morrow had turned the gun on himself one shot just one liv felt her legs buckle saw the granitefaced building fade someone gripped her arm as she swayed liv come on youd better sit down it was bobs voice in her ear his hand on her arm no she shook him off she wasnt going to faint she wasnt going to give in fiercely she began to push her way through the crowd again she was going to be standing up when he came through the doors when he came through them she would be there for him dont let him be hurt oh god dont let him be the fear was rising in her throat no hysterics she warned herself as she pushed a print reporter and two cameramen out of her way soon hell be striding across the street weve got a whole lifetime to start together today risks well take hundreds of risks together damn you thorpe together she shoved her way clear then she saw him alive whole walking toward her she was running past the barricades away from the crowd oh damn you thorpe damn you weeping she clung to him the more she shuddered the more she cursed him the tighter he held her suddenly she was laughing it was after all a beautiful day taking his hair in her hands liv pulled his head back to see his face you bastard youre going to beat me on the air with this arent you oh thorpe she pressed her mouth to his and tightened her hold neither of them took any note of the cameras whirling and clicking around them he drew her away and the grin was back though she could see traces of horror in his eyes from whatever had happened inside do you love me he demanded yes damn you yes when she tried to pull him back to her he held her off lifting a brow going to marry me the minute we get a license were not going to waste any time briefly his mouth touched hers they linked arms by the way carmichael he said as they strolled away from the building you owe me two hundred dollars
