the day the icicle works closed i the wind was cold pink snow was falling and milo pulcher had holes in his shoes he trudged through the pinkgray slush across the square from the courthouse to the jail the turnkey was drinking coffee out of a vinyl container expecting you he grunted which one you want to see first pulcher sat down grateful for the warmth it doesnt matter say what kind of kids are they the turnkey shrugged i mean do they give you any trouble how could they give me trouble if they dont clean their cells they dont eat what else they do makes no difference to me pulcher took the letter from judge pegrim out of his pocket and examined the list of his new clients avery foltis walter hopgood jimmy lasser sam schiesterman bourke smith madeleine gaultry none of the names meant anything to him ill take foltis he guessed and followed the turnkey to a cell the foltis boy was homely pimply and belligerent cripes he growled shrilly are you the best they can do for me pulcher took his time answering the boy was not very lovable but he reminded himself there was a fiftydollar retainer from the county for each one of these defendants and conditions being what they were pulcher could easily grow to love three hundred dollars dont give me a hard time he said amiably i may not be the best lawyer in the galaxy but im the one youve got cripes all right all right tell me what happened will you all i know is that youre accused of conspiracy to commit a felony specifically an act of kidnapping a minor child yeah thats it the boy agreed you want to know what happened he bounced to his feet then began acting out his story we were starving to death see arms clutched pathetically around his belly the icicle works closed down cripes i walked the streets nearly a year looking for something to do anything marching in place i even rented out for a while butthat didnt work out he scowled and fingered his pimply face pulcher nodded even a bodyrenter had to have some qualifications the most important one was a goodlooking diseasefree strong and agile physique so we got together and decided the hell there was money to be made hooking old swinburnes son soi guess we talked too much they caught us he gripped his wrists like manacles pulcher asked a few more questions and then interviewed two of the other boys he learned nothing he hadnt already known the six youngsters had planned a reasonably competent kidnapping and talked about it where they could be heard and if there was any hope of getting them off it did not make itself visible to their courtappointed attorney pulcher left the jail abruptly and went up the street to see charley dickon the committeeman was watching a threeway wrestling match on a flickery old tv set howd it go milo he greeted the lawyer keeping his eyes on the wrestling pulcher said im not going to get them off charley oh too bad dickon looked away from the set for the first time why not they admitted the whole thing handwriting made the hopgood boy on the ransom note they all had fingerprints and celltypes all over the place and besides they talked too much dickon said with a spark of interest what about tim lassers son sorry the committeeman looked thoughtful i cant help it charley the lawyer protested the kids hadnt been even routinely careful when they planned to kidnap the son of the mayor they had talked it over quite loudly in a juke joint the waitress habitually taped everything that went on in her booths pulcher suspected a thriving blackmail business but that didnt change the fact that there was enough on tape to show premeditation they had picked the mayors son up at school he had come with them perfectly willinglythe girl madeleine gaultry had been a babysitter for him the boy was only three years old but he couldnt miss an easy identification like that and there was more the ransom note had been sent special delivery and young foltis had asked the postoffice clerk to put the postage on instead of using the automatic meter the clerk remembered the pimply face very well indeed the committeeman sat politely while pulcher explained though it was obvious that most of his attention was on the snowy tv screen well milo thats the way it goes anyway you got a fast three hundred hey and that reminds me pulchers guard went up here said the committeeman rummaging through his desk he brought out a couple of pale green tickets you ought to get out and meet some more people the partys having its annual chester a arthur day dinner next week bring your girl i dont have a girl oh youll find one fifteen dollars per explained the committeeman handing over the tickets pulcher sighed and paid well that was what kept the wheels oiled and dickon had suggested his name to judge pegrim thirty dollars out of three hundred still left him a better weeks pay than he had had since the icicle works folded the committeeman carefully folded the bills into his pocket pulcher watching gloomily dickon was looking prosperous all right there was easily a couple of thousand in that wad pulcher supposed that dickon had been caught along with everybody else on the planet when the icicle works folded nearly everybody owned stock in it and certainly charley dickon whose politician brain got him a piece of nearly every major enterprise on altair ninea big clump of stock in the tourist agency a sizable share of the mining syndicate certainly he would have had at least a few thousand in the icicle works but it hadnt hurt him much he said none of my business but why dont you take that girl madeleine gaultry shes in jail get her out here he tossed over a bondsmans card pulcher pocketed it with a scowl that would cost another forty bucks anyway he estimated the bondsman would naturally be one of dickons club members pulcher noticed that dickon was looking strangely puzzled whats the matter like i say its none of my business but i dont get it you and the girl have a fight fight i dont even know her she said you did me no i dont know any madeleine gaultry wait a minute is that her married name did she used to be at the icicle works dickon nodded didnt you see her i didnt get to the womens wing i pulcher stood up oddly flustered say id better run along chancy this bondsman hes open now well he stopped babbling and left madeleine gaultry only her name had been madeleine cossett it was funny that she should turn up nowin jail and pulcher abruptly realized likely to stay there indefinitely but he put that thought out of his mind first he wanted to see her the snow was turning lavender now pink snow green snow lavender snowany color of the pastel rainbow it was nothing unusual that was what had made altair nine worth colonizing in the first place now of course it was only a way of getting your feet wet pulcher waited impatiently at the turnkeys office while he shambled over to the womens wing and slowly returned with the girl they looked at each other she didnt speak pulcher opened his mouth closed it and silently took her by the elbow he steered her out of the jail and hailed a cab that was an extravagance but he didnt care madeleine shrank into a corner of the cab looking at him out of blue eyes that were large and shadowed she wasnt hostile she wasnt afraid she was only remote hungry she nodded pulcher gave the cab driver the name of a restaurant another extravagance but he didnt mind the prospect of cutting down on lunches for a few weeks he had had enough practice at it a year before this girl had been the prettiest secretary in the pool at the icicle works he dated her half a dozen times there was a company rule against it but the first time it was a kind of schoolboys prank breaking the headmasters regulations and the other times it was a driving need then then came the gumpert process that was the killer the gumpert process whoever gumpert was all anybody at the icicle works knew was that someone named gumpert had come up with a cheap practical method of synthesizing the rainbow antibiotic molds that floated free in altair nines air coloring its precipitation and more important providing a priceless export commodity a whole galaxy had depended on those rainbow molds shipped in frozen suspensions to every inhabited planet by altamycin incthe proper name for what everyone on altair nine called the icicle works when the gumpert process came along suddenly the demand vanished worse the jobs vanished pulcher had been on the corporations legal staff with an office of his own and a faint hint of a vicepresidency some day he was out the stenos in the pool all but two or three of the five hundred who once had got out the correspondence and the bills they were out the shipping clerks in the warehouse were out the pumphands at the settling tanks were out the freezer attendants were out everyone was out the plant closed down there were more than fifty tons of frozen antibiotics in storage and though there might still be a faint trickle of orders from oldfashioned diehards around the galaxy the shipments already en route would much more than satisfy them fifty tons once the icicle works had shipped three hundred tons a dayphysical transport electronic rockets that took years to cover the distance between stars the boom was over and of course on a oneindustry planet everything else was over too pulcher took the girl by the arm and swept her into the restaurant eat he ordered i know what jail food is like he sat down firmly determined to say nothing until she had finished but he couldnt long before she was ready for coffee he burst out why madeleine why would you get into something like this she looked at him but did not answer what about your husband he didnt want to ask it but he had to that had been the biggest blow of all the unpleasant blows that had struck him after the icicle works closed just as he was getting a law practice goingnot on any big scale but through charley dickon and the party a small steady handout of political favors that would make it possible for him to pretend he was still an attorneythe gossip reached him that madeleine cossett had married the girl pushed her plate away he emigrated pulcher digested that slowly emigrated that was the dream of every niner since the works closed down of course but it was only a dream physical transport between the stars was ungodly expensive more it was ungodly slow ten years would get you to dell the thinaired planet of a chilly little red dwarf the nearest good planet was thirty years away what it all added up to was that emigrating was almost like dying if one member of a married couple emigrated it meant the end of the marriage we got a divorce said madeleine nodding there wasnt enough money for both of us to go and jon was unhappier here than i was she took out a cigarette and let him light it you dont want to ask me about jon do you but you want to know all right jon was an artist he was in the advertising department at the works but that was just temporary he was going to do something big then the bottom dropped out for him just as it did for all of us well milo i didnt hear from you pulcher protested it wouldnt have been fair for me to see you when i didnt have a job or anything of course youd think that its wrong but i couldnt find you to tell you it was wrong and then jon was very persistent he was tall curlyhaired he has a babys facedo you know he only shaved twice a week well i married him it lasted three months then he just had to get away she leaned forward earnestly dont think he was just a bum milo he really was quite a good artist but we didnt have enough money for paints even and then it seems that the colors are all wrong here jon explained it in order to paint landscapes that sell you have to be on a planet with earthtype colors theyre all the vogue and theres too much altamycin in the clouds here pulcher said stiffly i see but he didnt really there was at least one unexplained part if there hadnt been enough money for paint then where had the money come from for a starship ticket physical transport it meant at least ten thousand dollars there just was no way to raise ten thousand dollars on altair nine not without taking a rather extreme step the girl wasnt looking at him her eyes were fixed on a table across the restaurant a table with a loud drunken party it was only lunch time but they had a three oclockinthemorning air about them they were stinking there were four of them two men and two women and their physical bodies were those of young healthy quite goodlooking perfectly normal niners the appearance of the physical bodies was entirely irrelevant though because they were tourists around the neck of each of them was a bright golden choker with a glowing red signal jewel in the middle it was the mark of the tourist agency the sign that the bodies were rented milo pulcher looked away quickly his eyes stopped on the white face of the girl and abruptly he knew how she had raised the money to send jon to another star ii pulcher found the girl a room and left her there it was not what he wanted what he wanted was to spend the evening with her and to go on spending time with her until time came to an end but there was the matter of her trial twentyfour hours ago he had got the letter notifying him that the court had appointed him attorney for six suspected kidnapers and looked on it as a fast fee no work to speak of no hope for success he would lose the case certainly well what of it but now he wanted to win it meant some fast hard work if he was to have even a chance and at best he admitted to himself the chance would not be good still he wasnt going to give up without a try the snow stopped as he located the home of jimmy lassers parents it was a sportinggoods shop not far from the main tourist agency it had a window full of guns and boots and scuba gear he walked in tinkling a bell as he opened the door mr lasser a plump little man leaning back in a chair by the door got slowly up looking him over in back he said shortly he led pulcher behind the store to a threeroom apartment the living room was comfortable enough but for some reason it seemed unbalanced one side was somehow heavier than the other he noticed the nap of the rug still flattened out where something heavy had been something rectangular and large about the size of a tv electronic entertainment unit repossessed said lasser shortly sit down dickon called you a minute ago oh it had to be something important dickon wouldnt have tracked him down for any trivial matter dont know what he wanted but he said you werent to leave till he called back sit down mayll bring you a cup of tea pulcher chatted with them for a minute while the woman fussed over a teapot and a plate of soft cookies he was trying to get the feel of the home he could understand madeleine gaultrys desperation he could understand the foltis boy a misfit in society anywhere what about jimmy lasser the elder lassers were both pushing sixty they were first generation niners off an earth colonizing ship they hadnt been born on earth of coursethe trip took nearly a hundred years physical transport they had been born in transit had married on the ship as the ship had reached maximum population level shortly after they were born they were allowed to have no children until they landed at that time they were all of forty may lasser said suddenly please help our boy mr pulcher it isnt jimmys fault he got in with a bad crowd you know how it is no work nothing for a boy to do ill do my best but it was funny pulcher thought how it was always the crowd that was bad it was never jimmyand never avery never sam never walter pulcher sorted out the five boys and remembered jimmy nineteen years old quite colorless polite not very interested what had struck the lawyer about him was only surprise that this rabbity boy should have had the enterprise to get into a criminal conspiracy in the first place hes a good boy said may lasser pathetically that trouble with the parked cars two years ago wasnt his fault he got a fine job right after that you know ask his probation officer then the icicle works closed she poured more tea slopping it over the side of the cup oh sorry but but when he went to the unemployment office mr pulcher do you know what they said to him i know they asked him would he take a job if offered she hurried on unheeding a job as if i didnt know what they meant by a job they meant renting she plumped the teapot down on the table and began to weep mr pulcher i wouldnt let him rent if i died for it there isnt anything in the bible that says you can let someone else use your body and not be responsible for what it does you know what tourists do if thy right hand offend thee cut it off it doesnt say unless somebody else is using it mr pulcher renting is a sin may mr lasser put his teacup down and looked directly at pulcher what about it pulcher can you get jimmy off the attorney reflected he hadnt known about jimmy lassers probation before and that was a bad sign if the county prosecutor was holding out on information of that sort it meant he wasnt willing to cooperate probably he would be trying for a conviction with maximum sentence of course he didnt have to tell a defense attorney anything about the previous criminal records of his clients but in a juvenile case where all parties were usually willing to go easy on the defendants it was customary i dont know mr lasser ill do the best i can damn right you will barked lasser dickon tell you who i am i was committeeman here before him you know so get busy pull strings dickon will back you or ill know why pulcher managed to control himself ill do the best i can i already told you that if you want strings pulled youd better talk to dickon yourself i only know law i dont know anything about politics the atmosphere was becoming unpleasant pulcher was glad to hear the ringing of the phone in the store outside may lasser answered it and said for you mr pulcher charley dickon pulcher gratefully picked up the phone dickons rich political voice said sorrowfully milo listen i been talking to judge pegrims secretary he isnt gonna let the kids off with a slap on the wrist theres a lot of heat from the mayors office pulcher protested desperately but the swinbume kid wasnt hurt he got better care with madeleine than he was getting at home i know milo the committeeman agreed but thats the way she lies so what i wanted to say to you milo is dont knock yourself out on this one because you arent going to win it but pulcher suddenly became aware of the lassers just behind him but i think i can get an acquittal he said entirely out of hope knowing that it wasnt true dickon chuckled you got lasser breathing down your neck sure milo but you want my advice youll take a quick hearing let them get sentenced and then try for executive clemency in a couple months ill help you get it and thats another five hundred or so for you see the committeeman was being persuasive it was a habit of his dont worry about lasser i guess hes been telling you what a power he is in politics here forget it and say tell him i notice he hasnt got his tickets for the chester a arthur day dinner yet you pick up the dough from him will you ill mail him the tickets nohold on dont ask him just tell him what i said the connection went dead pulcher stood holding a dead phone conscious of lasser standing right behind him so long charley he said paused nodded into space and said so long again then the attorney turned about to deliver the committeemans message about that most important subject the tickets to the chester a arthur day dinner lasser grumbled damn dickon hes into you for one thing after another wheres he think im going to get thirty bucks tim please his wife touched his arm lasser hesitated oh all right but you better get jimmy off hear pulcher got away at last and hurried out into the cold slushy street at the corner he caught a glimpse of something palely glowing overhead and stopped transfixed a huge skytrout was swimming purposefully down the avenue it was a monster twelve feet long at least and more than two feet thick at the middle it would easily go eighteen nineteen ounces the sort of lunker that sportsmen hiked clear across the dismal hills to bag pulcher had never in his life seen one that size in fact he could only remember seeing one or two fingerlings swim over inhabited areas it gave him a cold worried feeling the skyfish were about the only tourist attraction altair nine had left to offer from all over the galaxy sportsmen came to shoot them with their great porous flesh filled with bubbles of hydrogen real biological zeppelins that did not fly in the air but swam it before human colonists arrived they had been altair nines highest form of life they were so easy to destroy with gunfire that they had almost been exterminated in the inhabited sections only in the high cold hills had a few survived and now were even the fish aware that altair nine was becoming a ghost planet the next morning pulcher phoned madeleine but didnt have breakfast with her though he wanted to very much he put in the whole day working on the case in the morning he visited the families and friends of the accused boys in the afternoon he followed a few hunches from the families he learned nothing the stories were all about the same the youngest boy was foltis only seventeen the oldest was hopgood at twentysix they all had lost their jobs most of them at the icicle works saw no future and wanted offplanet well physical transport meant a minimum of ten thousand dollars and not one of them had a chance in the worlds of getting that much money in any legitimate way mayor swinburne was a rich man and his threeyearold son was the apple of his eye it must have been an irresistible temptation to try to collect ransom money pulcher realized the mayor could certainly afford it and once the money was collected and they were aboard a starship it would be almost impossible for the law to pursue them pulcher managed to piece together the way the thing had started the boys all lived in the same neighborhood the neighborhood where madeleine and jon gaultry had had a little apartment they had seen madeleine walking with the mayors sonshe had had a parttime job now and then taking care of him the only part of the thing that was hard to believe was that madeleine had been willing to take part in the scheme once the boys approached her but milo remembering the expression on the girls face as she looked at the tourists decided that wasnt so strange after all for madeleine had rented physical transport was expensive and eternally slow but there was a faster way for a man to travel from planet to planetpractically instantaneous from one end of the galaxy to the other the pattern of the mind is electronic in nature it can be taped and it can be broadcast on an electromagnetic frequency what was more like any electromagnetic signal it could be used to modulate an ultrawave carrier the result instantaneous transmission of personality anywhere in the civilized galaxy the only problem was that there had to be a receiver the naked ghost of a man stripped of flesh and juices was no more than the countless radio and tv waves that passed through everyone all the time the transmitted personality had to be given form there were mechanical receivers of coursecomputer like affairs with mercury memory cells where a mans intelligence could be received and could be made to activate robot bodies but that wasnt fun the tourist trade was built on fun live bodies were needed to satisfy the customers no one wanted to spend the price of a fishing broadcast to altair nine in order to find himself pursuing the quarry in some clanking tractor with photocell eyes and solenoid muscles a body was wanted even a rather attractive body a body which would be firm where the tourists own perhaps was flabby healthy where the tourists own had wheezed having such a body there were other sports to enjoy than fishing oh the laws were strict about misuse of rented bodies but the tourist trade was the only flourishing industry left on altair nine the laws remained strict but they remained unenforced pulcher checked in with charley dickon i found out why madeleine got into this thing she rented signed a longterm lease with the tourist agency and got a big advance on her earnings dickon shook his head sadly what people will do for money he commented it wasnt for her she gave it to her husband so he could get a ticket to someplace offworld pulcher got up turned around and kicked his chair as hard as he could renting was bad enough for a man for a woman it was take it easy dickon suggested grinning so she figured she could buy her way out of the contract with the money from swinburne wouldnt you do the same oh i dont know milo rentings not so bad the hell it isnt all right the hell it isnt but you ought to realize milo the committeeman said stiffly that if it wasnt for the tourist trade wed all be in trouble dont knock the tourist agency theyre doing a perfectly decent job then why wont they let me see the records the committeemans eyes narrowed and he sat up straighter i tried said pulcher i got them to show me madeleines lease agreement but i had to threaten them with a court order why then i tried to find out a little more about the agency itselfincorporation papers names of shareholders and so on they wouldnt give me a thing why dickon said after a second i could ask you that too milo why did you want to know pulcher said seriously i have to make a case any way i can charley theyre all dead on the evidence theyre guilty but every one of them went into this kidnapping stunt in order to stay away from renting maybe i cant get judge pegrim to listen to that kind of evidence but maybe i can its my only chance if i can show that renting is a form of cruel and unusual punishmentif i can find something wrong in it something that isnt allowed in its charter then i have a chance not a good chance but a chance and theres got to be something wrong charley because otherwise why would they be so secretive dickon said heavily youre getting in pretty deep milo ever occur to you youre going about this the wrong way wrong how what can the incorporation papers show you you want to find out what rentings like it seems to me the only way that makes sense is to try it yourself rent me pulcher was shocked the committeeman shrugged well i got a lot to do he said and escorted pulcher to the door the lawyer walked sullenly away rent him but he had to admit that it made a certain amount of sense he made a private decision he would do what he could to get madeleine and the others out of trouble completely out of trouble but if in the course of trying the case he couldnt magic up some way of getting her out of the lease agreement as well as getting an acquittal he would make damn sure that he didnt get the acquittal jail wasnt so bad renting for madeleine gaultry was considerably worse iii pulcher marched into the unemployment office the next morning with an air of determination far exceeding what he really felt talk about loyalty to a client but he had spent the whole night brooding about it and dickon had been right the clerk blinked at him and wheezed gee youre mr pulcher arent you i never thought id see you here things pretty slow pulchers uncertainty made him belligerent i want to rent my body he barked am i in the right place or not well sure mr pulcher i mean youre not if its voluntary but its been so long since they had a voluntary that it dont make much difference you know i mean i can handle it for you wait a minute he turned away hesitated glanced at pulcher and said i better use the other phone he was gone only a minute he came back with a look of determined embarrassment mr pulcher look i thought i better call charley dickon he isnt in his office why dont you wait until i can clear it with him pulcher said grimly its already cleared with him the clerk hesitated but oh all right he said miserably scribbling on a pad right across the street oh and tell them youre a volunteer i dont know if that will make them leave the cuffs off you but at least itll give them a laugh he chuckled pulcher took the slip of paper and walked sternly across the street to the tourist rental agency procurement office observing without pleasure that there were bars on the windows a husky guard at the door straightened up as he approached and said genially all right sonny it isnt going to be as bad as you think just gimme your wrists a minute wait said puleher quickly putting his hands behind him you wont need the handcuffs for me im a volunteer the guard said dangerously dont kid with me sonny then he took a closer look hey i know you youre the lawyer i saw you at the primary dance he scratched his ear he said doubtfully well maybe you are a volunteer go on in but as pulcher strutted past he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder and click click his wrists were circled with steel he whirled furiously no hard feelings boomed the guard cheerfully it costs a lot of dough to get you ready thats all they dont want you changing your mind when they give you the squeeze see the squeeze all right said pulcher and turned away again the squeeze it didnt sound so good at that but he had a little too much pride left to ask the guard for details anyway it couldnt be too bad he was sure wasnt he after all it wasnt the same as being executed an hour and a half later he wasnt so sure they had stripped him weighed him fluorographed him taken samples of his blood saliva urine and spinal fluid they had thumped his chest and listened to the strangled pounding of the arteries in his arm all right you pass said a fortyish blonde in a stained nurses uniform youre lucky today openings all over you can take your pickmining sailing anything you like whatll it be what while youre renting whats the matter with you you got to be doing something while your bodys rented you know of course you can have the tank if you want to but they mostly dont like that youre conscious the whole time you know pulcher said honestly i dont know what youre talking about but then he remembered while a persons body was rented out there was the problem of what to do with his own mind and personality it couldnt stay in the body it had to go somewhere else the tank was a storage device only that and nothing more the displaced mind was held in a sort of pickling vat of transistors and cells until its own body could be returned to it he remembered a client of his bosss while he was still clerking who had spent eight weeks in the tank and had then come out to commit a murder no not the tank he said coughing what else is there the nurse said impatiently golly whatever you want i guess theyve got a big call for miners operating the deep gas generators right now if you want that its pretty hot is all they burn the coal into gas and of course youre right in the middle of it but i dont think you feel much not too much i dont know about sailing or rocketing because you have to have some experience for that there might be something with the taxi company but i ought to tell you usually the renters dont want that because the live drivers dont like seeing the machines running cabs sometimes if they see a machinecab they tip it over naturally if theres any damage to the host machine its risky for you pulcher said faintly ill try mining he went out of the room in a daze a small bleached towel around his middle his only garment and hardly aware of that his own clothes had been whisked away and checked long ago the tourist who would shortly wear his body would pick his own clothes the haberdashery was one of the more profitable subsidiaries of the tourist agency then he snapped out of his daze as he discovered what was meant by the squeeze a pair of husky experts lifted him onto a slab whisked away the towel unlocked and tossed away the handcuffs while one pinned him down firmly at the shoulders the other began to turn viselike wheels that moved molded forms down upon him it was like a sectional sarcophagus closing in on him pulcher had an instant childhood recollection of some story or otherthe walls closing in the victim inexorably squeezed to death he yelled hey hold it what are you doing the man at his head bored said oh dont worry this your first time we got to keep you still you know scannings close work but now shut up and relax the man said reasonably if you wiggle when the tracers scanning you you could get your whole personality messed up not only that we might damage the body an then the agencyd have a suit on its hands see tourists dont like damaged bodies come on vince get the legs lined up so i can do the head but said pulcher again and then with effort relaxed it was only for twentyfour hours after all he could stand anything for twentyfour hours and he had been careful to sign up for only that long go ahead he said its only for twentyfour hours what oh sure friend lights out now have a pleasant dream and something soft but quite firm came down over his face he heard a muffled sound of voices then there was a quick ripping feeling as though he had been plucked out of some sticky surrounding medium then it hurt pulcher screamed it didnt accomplish anything he no longer had a voice to scream with funny he had always thought of mining as something that was carried on underground he was under water there wasnt any doubt of it he could see vagrant eddies of sand moving in a current he could see real fish not the hydrogen zeppelins of the air he could see bubbles arising from some source of the sand at his feet no not at his feet he didnt have feet he had tracks a great steel bug swam up in front of him and said raspingly all right you there lets go funny again he didnt hear the voice with earshe didnt have ears and there was no stereophonic sensebut he did somehow hear it seemed to be speaking inside his brain radio sonar come on growled the bug experimentally pulcher tried to talk watch it squeaked a thin little voice and a tiny manytreaded steel beetle squirmed out from under his tracks it paused to rear back and look at him dope it chattered scathingly a bright flame erupted from its snout as it squirmed away the big bug rasped go on follow the burner mac pulcher thought of walking rather desperately yes something was happening he lurched and moved oh god sighed the steel bug hanging beside him watching with critical attention this your first time i figured they always give me the new ones to break in look that burnerthe little thing that just went down the mine mac thats a burner its going to burn the hard rock out of a new shaft you follow it and pull the sludge out with your buckets mac pulcher gamely started his treads and lurchingly followed the little burner all around him visible through the churned silty water he caught glimpses of other machines working there were big ones and little ones some with great elephantine flexible steel trunks that sucked silt and mud away some with wasps stingers that planted charges of explosive some like himself with buckets for hauling and scooping out pits the mine whatever sort of mine it was to be was only a bare scratchedout beginning on the sea floor as yet it took himan hour a minute he had no means of telling timeto learn the rudiments of operating his new steel body then it became boring also it became painful the first few scoops of sandy grime he carried out of the new pit made his buckets tingle the tingle became a pain the pain an ache the ache a blazing agony he stopped something was wrong they couldnt expect him to go on like this hey mac get busy will you but it hurts goddamighty mac its supposed to hurt how else would you be able to feel when you hit something hard you want to break your buckets on me mac pulcher gritted hisnotteeth squared his notshoulders and went back to digging ultimately the pain became through habit bearable it didnt become less it just became bearable it was boring except when once he did strike a harder rock than his phospherbronze buckets could handle and had to slither back out of the way while the burner chopped it up for him but that was the only break in the monotony otherwise the work was strictly routine it gave him plenty of time to think this was not altogether a boon i wonder he thought with a drowned clash of buckets i wonder what my body is doing now perhaps the tenant who now occupied his body was a businessman pulcher thought prayerfully a man who had had to come to altair nine quickly on urgent businessget a contract signed make a trading deal arrange an interstellar loan that wouldnt be so bad a businessman would not damage a rented property no at the worst a businessman might drink one or two cocktails too many perhaps eat an indigestible lunch all right so whenin surely only a few hours nowpulcher resumed his body the worst he could expect would be a hangover or dyspepsia well what of that an aspirin a dash of bicarb but maybe the tourist would not be a businessman pulcher flailed the coarse sand with his buckets and thought apprehensively he might be a sportsman still even that wouldnt be so bad the tourist might walk his body up and down a few dozen mountains perhaps even sleep it out in the open overnight there might be a cold possibly even pneumonia of course there might also be an accidenttourists did fall off the dismal hills there could be a broken leg but that was not too bad it was only a matter of a few days rest a little medical attention but maybe pulcher thought grayly ignoring the teeming agony of his buckets maybe the tenant will be something worse he had heard queer smutty stories about female tenants who rented male bodies it was against the law but you kept hearing the stories he had heard of men who wanted to experiment with drugs with drink withwith a thousand secret sordid lusts of the flesh all of them were unpleasant and yet in a rented body where the ultimate price of dissipation would be borne by someone else who might not try one of them for there was no physical consequence to the practitioner if mrs lasser was right perhaps there was not even a consequence in the hereafter twentyfour hours had never passed so slowly the suction hoses squabbled with the burners the scoops quarreled with the dynamiters all the animate submarine mining machines constantly irritably snapped at each other but the work was getting done it seemed to be a lot of work to accomplish in one twentyfour hour day pulcher thought seriously the pit was down two hundred yards now and braced new wetsetting concrete pourers were already laying a floor shimmery little spiderlike machines whose limbs held chemical testing equipment were sniffing every load of sludge that came out now for richness of ore the mine was nearly ready to start producing after a time pulcher began to understand the short tempers of the machines none of the minds in these machines were able to forget that up topside their bodies were going about unknown errands risking unguessed dangers at any given moment that concrete pourers body for instance might be dying might be acquiring a disease might be stretched out in narcotic stupor or might gayly be risking dismemberment in a violent sport naturally tempers were touchy there was no such thing as rest as coffeebreaks or sleep for the machines they kept going pulcher when finally he remembered that he had had a purpose in coming here it was not merely some punishment that had come blindly to him for a forgotten sin began to try to analyse his own feelings and to guess at the feelings of the others the whole thing seemed unnecessarily mean pulcher understood quite clearly why anyone who had had the experience of renting would never want to do it again but why did it have to be so unpleasant surely at least conditions for the rentermind in a machinebody could be made more bearable the tactile sensations could be reduced from pain to some more supportable feeling without enough loss of sensation to jeopardize the desired ends he wondered wistfully if madeleine had once occupied this particular machine then he wondered how many of the dynamiters and diggers were female how many male it seemed somehow wrong that their gleaming stainlesssteel or phosphorbronze exteriors should give no hint of age or sex there ought to be some lighter work for women he thought idly and then realized that the thought was nonsense what difference did it make you could work your buckets off and when you got back topside youd be healthy and rested and then he had a quick dizzying qualm as he realized that that thought would be the thought in the mind of the tourist now occupying his own body pulcher licked hisnotlips and attacked the sand with his buckets more viciously than before all right mac the familiar steel bug was back beside him come on back to the barn it scolded you think i want to have to haul you back times up get the tracks back in the parking lot never was an order so gladly obeyed but the overseer had cut it rather fine pulcher had just reached the parking space had not quite turned his clanking steel frame around when rip the tearing and the pain hit him and he found himself struggling against the enfolded soft shroud that they called the squeeze relax friend soothed a distant voice abruptly the pressure was removed from his face and the voice came nearer there you are have a nice dream pulcher kicked the rubbery material off his legs he sat up ouch he said suddenly and rubbed his eye the man by his head looked down at him and grinned some shiner mustve been a good party he was stripping the sections of rubbery gripping material off him as he talked youre lucky ive seen them come back in here with legs broken teeth out even bullet holes friend you wouldnt believe me if i told you specially the girls he handed pulcher another bleached towel all right youre through here dont worry about the eye friend thats easy two three days old already another day or two and you wont even notice it hey pulcher cried suddenly what do you mean two or three days how long was i down there the man glanced boredly at the greentabbed card on pulchers wrist lets see this is thursday six days but i only signed up for twentyfour hours sure you did plus emergency overcalls naturally what do you think friend the agencys going to evict some bigspending tourist just because you want your body back in twentyfour hours cant do it you can see that the agencyd lose a fortune that way unceremoniously pulcher was hoisted to his feet and escorted to the door if only these jokers would read the fine print the first man was saying mournfully to his helper as pulcher left oh well if they had any brains they wouldnt rent in the first placethen what would me and you do for jobs the closing door swallowed their laughter six days pulcher raced through medical checkout clothes redemption payoff at the cashiers window hurry please he kept saying cant you please hurry he couldnt wait to get to a phone but he had a pretty good idea already what the phone call would tell him five extra days no wonder it had seemed so long down there while up in the city time had passed along he found a phone at last and quickly dialed the private number of judge pegrims office the judge wouldnt be there but that was the way pulcher wanted it he got pegrims secretary miss kish this is milo pulcher her voice was cold so there you are where have you been the judge was furious i he despaired of explaining it to her he could hardly explain it to himself ill tell you later miss kish please where does the kidnap case stand now why the hearing was yesterday since we couldnt locate you the judge had to appoint another attorney naturally after all mr pulcher an attorney is supposed to be in count when his clients are i know that miss kish what happened it was open and shut they all pleaded no contestit was over in twenty minutes it was the only thing to do on the evidence you see theyll be sentenced this afternoonaround three oclock id say if youre interested iv it was snowing again blue this time pulcher paid the cab driver and ran up the steps of the courthouse as he reached for the door he caught sight of three airfish solemnly swimming around the corner of the building toward him even in his hurry he paused to glance at them it was past three but the judge had not yet entered the courtroom there were no spectators but the six defendants were already in their seats a bailiff lounging next to them counsels table was occupied bypulcher squintedoh by donley pulcher knew the other lawyer slightly he was a youngster with good political connectionsthat explained the courts appointing him for the fee when pulcher didnt show upbut without much to recommend him otherwise madeleine gaultry looked up as pulcher approached then looked away one of the boys caught sight of him scowled whispered to the others their collective expressions were enough to sear his spirit pulcher sat at the table beside donley hello mind if i join you donley twisted his head oh hello charley sure i didnt expect to see you here he laughed say that eyes pretty bad i guess he stopped something happened in donleys face the young babyfat cheeks became harder older more worriedlooking donley clamped his lips shut pulcher was puzzled whats the matter are you wondering where i was donley said stiffly well you cant blame me for that i couldnt help it donley i was renting i was trying to gather evidencenot that that helps much now i found one thing out though even a lawyer can goof in reading a contract did you know the tourist agency has the right to retain a body for up to fortyfive days regardless of the original agreement its in their contract i was lucky i guess they only kept me five donleys face did not relax thats interesting he said noncommittally the mans attitude was most peculiar pulcher could understand being needled by donleycould even understand this coldness if it had been from someone elsebut it wasnt like donley to take mere negligence so seriously but before he could try to pin down exactly what was wrong the other lawyer stood up on your feet pulcher he said in a stage whisper here comes the judge pulcher jumped up he could feel judge pegrims eyes rake over him they scratched like diamondtipped drills in an ordinarily political reasonably corrupt community judge pegrim was one man who took his job seriously and expected the same from those around him mr pulcher he purred were honored to have you with us pulcher began an explanation but the judge waved it away mr pulcher you know that an attorney is an officer of the court and as such is expected to know his dutiesand to fulfill them well your honor i thought i was fulfilling them i ill discuss it with you at another time mr pulcher the judge said right now we have a rather disagreeable task to get through bailiff lets get started it was all over in ten minutes donley made a couple of routine motions but there was no question about what would happen it happened each of the defendants drew a tenyear sentence the judge pronounced it distastefully adjourned the count and left he did not look at milo pulcher pulcher tried for a moment to catch madeleines eye then he succeeded shaken he turned away bumping into donley i dont understand it he mumbled what dont you understand well dont you think thats a pretty stiff sentence donley shrugged he wasnt very interested pulcher scanned the masklike young face there was no sympathy there it was funny in a way this was a face of flint the plight of six young people doomed to spend a decade each of their lives in prison did not move him at all pulcher said dispiritedly i think ill go see charley dickon do that said donley curtly and turned away but pulcher couldnt find charley dickon he wasnt at his office wasnt at the club nope said the garrulous retired police lieutenant who was the club presidentand who used the club headquarters as a checker salon i havent seen charley in a couple of days be at the dinner tonight though youll see him there it wasnt a question whether pulcher would be at the dinner or not pop craig knew he would after all charley had passed the word out everybody would be there pulcher went back to his apartment it was the first time he had surveyed his body since reclaiming it the bathroom mirror told him that he had a gorgeous shiner indeed also certain twinges made him strip and examine his back it looked he thought gloomily staring over his shoulder into the mirror as though whoever had rented his body had had a perfectly marvelous time he made a mental note to get a complete checkup some day soon just in case then he showered shaved talcumed around the black eye without much success and dressed he sat down poured himself a drink and promptly forgot it was there he was thinking something was trying to reach the surface of his mind something perfectly obvious which he all the same couldnt quite put his finger on it was rather annoying he found himself drowsily thinking of airfish damn he thought grouchily his bodys late tenant hadnt even troubled to give it a decent nights sleep but he didnt want to sleep not now it was still only early evening he supposed the chester a arthur day dinner was still a must but there were hours yet before that he got up poured the untasted drink into the sink and set out there was one thing he could try to help madeleine it probably wouldnt work but nothing else would either so that was no reason for not trying it the mayors mansion was ablaze with light something was going on pulcher trudged up the long circling driveway in slush that kept splattering his ankles he tapped gingerly on the door the butler took his name doubtfully and isolated pulcher in a contagionfree sitting room while he went off to see if the mayor would care to admit such a person he came back looking incredulous the mayor would mayor swinburne was a healthy lean man of medium height showing only by his thinning hair that he was in his middle forties pulcher said mr mayor i guess you know who i am i represent the six kids who were accused of kidnapping your son not accused mr pulcher convicted and i didnt know you still represented them i see you know the score all right maybe in a legal sense i dont represent them any more but id like to make some representations on their behalf to you tonightentirely unofficially he gave the mayor a crisply worded brief outline of what had happened in the case how he had rented what he had found as a renter why he had missed the hearing you see sir the tourist agency doesnt give its renters even ordinary courtesy theyre just bodies nothing else i cant blame those kids now that ive rented myself ill have to say that i wouldnt blame anybody who did anything to avoid it the mayor said dangerously mr pulcher i dont have to remind you that whats left of our economy depends heavily on the tourist agency for income also that some of our finest citizens are among its shareholders including yourself mr mayor right pulcher nodded but the management may not be reflecting your wishes ill go farther i think sir that every contract the tourist agency holds with a renter ought to be voided as against public policy renting out your body for a purpose which well may be in violation of lawwhich going by experience nine times out of ten does involved a violation of lawis the same thing as contracting to perform any other illegal act the contract simply cannot be enforced the common law gives us a great many precedents on this point and please mr pulcher im not a judge if you feel so strongly why not take it to court pulcher sank back into his chair deflated there isnt time he admitted and besides its too late for that to help the six persons im interested in theyve already been driven into an even more illegal act in order to escape renting im only trying to explain it to you sir because you are their only hope you can pardon them the mayors face turned beet red executive clemency from me for them they didnt hurt your boy no they did not the mayor agreed and im sure that mrs gaultry at least would not willingly have done so but can you say the same of the others could she have prevented it he stood up im sorry mr pulcher the answer is no now you must excuse me pulcher hesitated then accepted the dismissal there wasnt anything else to do he walked somberly down the hail toward the entrance hardly noticing that guests were beginning to arrive apparently the mayor was offering cocktails to a select few he recognized some of the faceslew yoder the county tax assessor for one probably the mayor was having some of the whitercollared politicians in for drinks before making the obligatory appearance at dickons fundraising dinner pulcher looked up long enough to nod grayly at yoder and walked on charley dickon what the devil are you doing here like that pulcher jerked upright dickon here he looked around but dickon was not in sight only yoder was coming down the corridor toward him oddly yoder was looking straight at him and it had been yoders voice yoders face froze the expression on yoders face was an odd one but not unfamiliar to milo pulcher he had seen it once before that day it was the identical expression he had seen on the face of that young punk who had replaced him in court donley yoder said awkwardly oh milo its you hello i uh thought you were charley dickon pulcher felt the hairs at the back of his neck tingle something was odd here very odd its a perfectly natural mistake he said im six feet tall and charleys five feet three im thirtyone years old hes fifty im dark and hes almost bald i dont know how anybody ever tells us apart anyway what the devil are you talking about yoder blustered pulcher looked at him thoughtfully for a second youre lucky he admitted im not sure i know but i hope to find out v some things never change across the entrance to the new metropolitan cafe mens grille a long scarlet banner carried the words vote the straight ticket big poster portraits of the mayor and committeeman dickon flanked the door itself a squat little soundtruck parked outside the door blared ancient marches of the sort that political conventions had suffered through for more than two centuries back on earth it was an absolutely conventional political fundraising dinner it would have the absolutely conventional embalmed roast beef the one conventionally free watery manhattan at each place and the conventionally boring afterdinner speeches milo pulcher stamping about in the slush outside the entrance looked up at the constellations visible from altair nine and wondered if those same stars were looking down on just such another thousand dinners all over the galaxy politics went on wherever you were the constellations would be different of course the squirrel and the nut were all local stars and would have no shape at all from any other system but he caught sight of the tall thin figure he was waiting for and stepped out into the stream of smalltime political workers ignoring their greetings judge im glad you came judge pegrim said frostily i gave you my word milo but youve got a lot to answer to me for if this is a false alarm i dont ordinarily attend partisan political affairs it isnt an ordinary affair judge pulcher conducted him into the room and sat him at the table he had prepared once it had held place cards for four electionboard workers from the warehouse district who now buzzed from table to table angrily pulcher had filched their cards the judge was grumbling it doesnt comport well with the bench to attend this sort of thing milo i dont like it i know judge youre an honest man thats why i wanted you here mmm pulcher left him before the mmm could develop into a question he had fended off enough questions since the thoughtful half hour he had spent pacing back and forth in front of the mayors mansion he didnt want to fend off any more as he skirted the tables heading for the private room where he had left his special guests charley dickon caught his arm hey milo i see you got the judge out good boy hes just what we needed to make this dinner complete you have no idea how complete said pulcher pleasantly and walked away he didnt look back there was another fine potential questionsource and the committeemans would be even more difficult to answer than the judges besides he wanted to see madeleine the girl and her five accomplices were where he had left them the private bar where they were sitting was never used for affairs like this you couldnt see the floor from it still you could hear well enough and that was more important the boys were showing nervousness in their separate ways although they had been convicted hardly more than a day had been sentenced only a few hours they had fallen quickly into the convict habit being out on bail so abruptly was a surprise they hadnt expected it it made them nervous young foltis was jittering about muttering to himself the hopgood boy was slumped despondently in a corner blowing smoke rings jimmy lasser was making a castle out of sugar cubes only madeleine was relaxed as pulcher came in she looked up calmly is everything all right he crossed his fingers and nodded dont worry she said pulcher blinked dont worry it should have been he who was saying that to her not the other way around it came to him that there was only one possible reason for her calm confidence she trusted him but he couldnt stay the ballroom was full now and irritable banquet waiters were crashing plates down in front of the loyal party workers he had a couple of lastminute things to attend to he carefully avoided the eye of judge pegrim militantly alone at the table by the speakers dais and walked quickly across the room to jimmy lassers father he said without preamble do you want to help your son tim lasser snarled you cheap shyster you wouldnt even show up for the trial where do you get the nerve to ask me a question like that shut up i asked you something lasser hesitated then read something in pulchers eyes well of course i do he grumbled then tell me something it wont sound important but it is how many rifles did you sell in the past year lasser looked puzzled but he said not many maybe half a dozen business is lousy all over you know since the icicle works closed and in a normal year oh three or four hundred its a big tourist item you see they need coldshot rifles for hunting the fish a regular bulletll set them on firetouches off the hydrogen im the only sportinggoods merchant in town that carries them andsay what does that have to do with jimmy pulcher took a deep breath stick around and youll find out meanwhile think about what you just told me if rifles are a tourist item why did closing the icicle works hurt your sales he left but not quickly enough charley dickon scuttled over and clutched his arm his face furious hey milo what the hell i just heard from sam apfelthe bondsmanthat you got that whole bunch out of jail again on bail how come theyre my clients charley dont give me that howd you get them out when theyre convicted anyway im going to appeal the case pulcher said gently you dont have a leg to stand on why would pegrim grant bail anyhow pulcher pointed to judge pegrims solitary table ask him he invited and broke away he was burning a great many bridges behind him he knew it was an exhilarating feeling chancy but tingly he decided he liked it there was just one job to do as soon as he was clear of the scowling but stopped committeeman he walked by a circular route to the dais dickon was walking back to his table turned away from the dais pulchers chance would never be better hello pop he said pop craig looked up over his glasses oh milo ive been going over the list you think i got everybody charley wanted me to introduce all the block captains and anybody else important you know anybody important that aint on this list thats what i wanted to tell you pop charley said for you to give me a few minutes i want to say a few words craig said agitatedly aw milo if you make a speech theyre all gonna want to make speeches what do you want to make a speech for youre no candidate pulcher winked mysteriously what about next year he asked archly with a lying inference oh ohho pop craig nodded and returned to his list mumbling well in that case i guess i can fit you in after the block captains or maybe after the man from the sheriffs office but pulcher wasnt listening pulcher was already on his way back to the little private bar man had conquered all of space within nearly fifty light years of dull yellow old sol but out in that main ballroom political hacks were talking of longdead presidents of almost forgotten countries centuries in the past pulcher was content to listento allow the sounds to vibrate his eardrums at least for the words made little sense to him if indeed there was any content of sense to a political speech in the first place but they were soothing also they kept his six fledglings from bothering him with questions madeleine sat quietly by his shoulder quite relaxed still and smelling faintly pleasantly of some floral aroma it was all in all as pleasant a place to be as pulcher could remember in his recent past it was too bad that he would have to go out of it soon very soon the featured guest had droned through his platitudes the visiting celebrities had said their few words each pop craigs voluminous old voice took over again and now i wanta introduce some of the fine party workers from our local districts theres keith ciccareffi from the hillside area keith stand up and take a bow dutiful applause and heres mary beth whitehurst head of the womens club from riverview dutiful applauseand a whistle surely the whistle was sardonic mary beth was fat and would never again see fifty there were more names pulcher felt it coming the moment before pop craig reached his own name he was on his way to the dais even before craig droned out that fine young attorney and loyal party manthe kind of young fellow our party needsmilo pulcher dutiful applause again that was habit but pulcher felt the whispering question that fluttered around the room he didnt give the question a chance to grow he glanced once at the five hundred loyal party faces staring up at him and began to speak mr president mr mayor justice pegrim honored guests ladies and gentlemen that was protocol he paused what i have to say to you tonight is in the way of a compliment its a surprise for an old friend sitting right here that old friend ischarley dickon he threw the name at them it was a special political sort of delivery a tone of voice that commanded clap now they clapped that was important because it made it difficult for charley to think of an excuse to interrupt himas soon as charley realized he ought to which would be shortly way out here on the bleak frontier of interstellar space we live isolated lives ladies and gentlemen there were whispers he could hear them the words were more or less right but he didnt have the right political accent the audience knew there was something wrong the true politician would have said this fine growing frontier in the midst of interstellar spaces greatest constellations he couldnt help it he would have to rely on velocity now to get him through how isolated we sometimes need to reflect we have trade relations through the icicle worksnow closed we have tourists in both directions through the tourist agency we have ultrawave messagesalso through the tourist agency and thats about all thats a very thin link ladies and gentlemen very thin and im here to tell you tonight that it would be even thinner if it werent for my old friend thereyes committeeman charley dickon he punched the name again and got the applausebut it was puzzled and died away early the fact of the matter ladies and gentlemen is that just about every tourist thats come to altair nine this past year is the personal responsibility of charley dickon who have these tourists been they havent been businessmentheres no business they havent been hunters ask phil lasser over there he hasnt sold enough fishing equipment to put in your eye ask yourselves for that matter how many of you have seen airfish right over the city do you know why because they arent being hunted any more there arent any tourists to hunt them the time had come to give it to them straight the fact of the matter ladies and gentlemen is that the tourists weve had havent been tourists at all theyve been natives from right here on altair nine some of them are right in this room i know that because i rented myself for a few daysand do you know who took my body why charley did charley himself he was watching lew yoder out of the corner of his eye the assessors face turned gray he seemed to shrink pulcher enjoyed the sight though after all he had a certain debt to lew yoder it was yoders slip of the tongue that had finally started him thinking on the right track he went on hastily and what it all adds up to ladies and gentlemen is that charley dickon and a handful of his friends in high placesmost of them right here in this roomhave cut off communication between altair nine and the rest of the galaxy that did it there were yells and the loudest yell came from charley dickon throw him out arrest him craig get the sergeantatarms i say i dont have to sit here and listen to this maniac and i say you do boomed the cold courtroom voice of judge pegrim the judge stood up go on pulcher he ordered i came here tonight to hear what you have to say it may be wrong it may be right i propose to hear all of it before i make up my mind thank heaven for the cold old judge pulcher cut right in before dickon could find a new point of attack there wasnt much left to say anyway the story is simple ladies and gentlemen the icicle works was the most profitable corporation in the galaxy we all know that probably everybody in this room had a couple of shares of stock dickon had plenty but he wanted more and he didnt want to pay for them so he used his connection with the tourist agency to cut off communication between nine and the rest of the galaxy he spread the word that altamycin was worthless now because some fictitious character had invented a cheap new substitute he closed down the icicle works and for the last twelve months hes been picking up stock for a penny on the dollar while the rest of us starve and the altamycin the rest of the galaxy needs stays right here on altair nine and he stopped not because he had run out of words but because no one could hear them any longer the noises the crowd was making were no longer puzzled they were ferocious it figured apart from dickons immediate gang of manipulators there was hardly a man in the room who hadnt taken a serious loss in the past year it was time for the police to come rushing in as per the phone call judge pegrim had made protestingly when pulcher urged him to the dinner they didjust barely in time they werent needed to arrest dickon so much but they were indispensable for keeping him from being lynched hours later escorting madeleine home milo was still bubbling over i was worried about the mayor i couldnt make up my mind whether he was in it with charley or not im glad he wasnt because he said he owed me a favor and i told him how he could pay it executive clemency the six of you will be free in the morning madeleine said sleepily im free enough now and the tourist agency wont be able to enforce those contracts any more i talked it over with judge pegrim he wouldnt give me an official statement but he saidmadeleine youre not listening she yawned its been an exhausting day milo she apologized anyway you can tell me all about that later well have plenty of time years and years he promised years and they stopped talking the mechanical cabdriver sneaking around through back streets to avoid the resentment of displaced live drivers glanced over its condenser cells at them and chuckled making tiny sparks in the night
