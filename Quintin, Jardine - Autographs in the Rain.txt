his own christmas comes early in london so does closing time the couple stood on the edge of the pavement and looked along oxford street it was just over an hour before midnight the lights were shining their tableaux stretching all the way along towards marble arch buses and taxis flowed along regent street towards the circus business picking up again as the pubs began to empty jeez the tall man murmured its a shallow and inhospitable place this damn near two months to christmas and the fairy lights are on show already yet try and get a drink after eleven and youve no chance to paraphrase an old frankie song london by night is a god awful sight even on a friday come on now his companion laughed in her high heels she stood only three or four inches shorter than his six feet two she was golden haired stunningly beautiful in classic contrast to his rugged lifeformed features and her pale blue eyes seemed to reflect the sparkle of the pageant light her voice was full and mellow that of a contralto in her prime refined and with the faintest trace if one listened closely enough of a scottish accent glasgow was just the same when we were youngsters she said but without the bright lights i never cared when you were around no she countered quickly a chuckle in her throat nor when the other one was either you made your choice and from the way you were talking about your daughter tonight youve never regretted it suddenly for the first time that evening he was sombre he hunched his broad shoulders inside his barbour jacket his sigh expelling a great cloud of breath into the frosty night regret is your enemy he said if you give in to it it can destroy you its a waste of time anyway you cant change the past but would you if you could she asked him why would you the way you say that makes it sound as if i dumped you yet ive always understood that our breaking up was a joint decision she reached up and adjusted his tie looking at the knot rather than into his eyes then sir that just shows you how good i am at my job oh i didnt make a fuss when it happened i was a big girl i put on my mature face and agreed with all the common sense you talked she put a fingertip between her breasts but in here my little heart was breaking im sorry i really am he replied sincerely but i still think it was for the best so do i now no doubt about it but back while it was happening she smiled up at him with a flash of mischief in her eye did you love me then he nodded his steely hair glinting under the street lights yup she opened her mouth to respond but broke off as a pedestrian paused and turned to stare at her the man seemed to hesitate then carried on his way she looked back at him the interruption over but not as much as you loved her it was a statement as much as a question it wasnt just that i loved her sure although to be absolutely truthful i liked you more ahhh he paused for a few seconds gazing up at the night look lou i dont care about religion or any of that stuff just about whats right and whats wrong my first personal commandment is loyalty ive broken it twice in my life and found that i hated myself for it on both occasions the way i came to see it back then was that i made a promise when i got engaged if i had broken it off i couldnt have hacked the guilt and sooner or later id have blamed it on you and id have hated that for sure she conceded she chuckled again deep and warm at his frown dont worry i havent spent the last twenty five years pining for my lost love ive found a few since then two marriages three serious affairs not bad for a wee girl from bearsden ive never felt a pang of guilt either were totally different personalities you see yours is set in concrete and mines tossing about on lifes restless ocean id have left you by the time i was twentyone for sure she paused as a red bus roared by close to the kerb when was your other fall from grace she asked him a couple of years back he answered my second wife and i had a major fallout she went back to the states and i got involved with someone else we got over it though we found out that we mattered too much to each other to let go autographs in the rain she smiled again so theres no point in my asking you back to my place for a nightcap he raised an eyebrow at her question and glanced away out into the street that would depe in midsentence he stopped threw his left arm round her waist and flung himself sideways pulling her with him as he dived behind an abandoned newspaper stand they heard the blast behind them before they hit the ground and the scream of tyres as a dark coloured saloon accelerated away down regent street he was on his feet again in a second wait here he told the woman then ran off down the street after the car trying to catch a clear view of its numberplate only to see it disappear round the curve in the broad street heading for piccadilly circus she too was standing once again as he returned to their safe haven no one had come to her aid indeed none of the few people who had been passing at the time were anywhere to be seen she stared at him bewildered but apparently not in the least frightened you swept me off my feet once before she exclaimed but never like that what was that about he glared back down regent street when someone shoots at me he said tersely i tend to get out of the way her hand flew to her mouth and her eyes seemed to flash as they widened someone shot at you its happened before he told her dryly didnt you see the gun i heard a bang but that was all what was it the guy in that car had a shotgun i just happened to be looking that way as he stuck it out the window and took a bead on me but who would want to shoot you his mouth twisted in a grimace as he unfastened a pocket of his jacket and took out a handphone more people than you could shake a stick at my dear he murmured as he punched in the police emergency number do you ever get enraged about anything sammy what enraged i said as in really steamed up with anger he looked at her as she stood there all lips and legs enraged no not sos youd notice anyway now if youd said engorged but i didnt ruth frowned at him severely he grinned back why dyou ask anyway am i beginning to bore you ms mcconnell she shook her head making her long glossy hair ripple like a shampoo commercial not yet sergeant not yet all the same you are getting predictable youre the easiest going man ive ever been out with a typical copper in other words absolutely atypical as far as ive seen where i work its like a madhouse at times ive never seen so many stressedout people he looked at her with a touch of scepticism in his eyes such as i know the big man can go a bit stratospheric from time to time but the chiefs an eventempered sort and di mcllhenneys okay too isnt he up to a point she hesitated i shouldnt tell tales out of school but she frowned no better not aw come on ruthie he exclaimed you cant do that to me honest to christ i dont know you seem to be making a career out of leading me on then slamming the bloody door in my face what do you mean by that she raised an eyebrow provoking him even further you know bloody well what i mean no spell it out you know no tell me okay weve been going out for how long six months now yet weve never autographs in the rain so she asked archly so most people most couples shag on their first date no i wouldnt go that far well neither would i he drew the car to a halt in a layby and switched off the engine fine he murmured turning to her but after this long id have thought that our relationship might have moved up a gear shall we say you can say it if you like detective sergeant pye but can you tell me why it should do you think youre gods gift or something no he protested but its not as if you he stopped himself short and bit his lip fortunately she laughed as if i havent been round the block a few times was that it no i wouldnt be that crude ruthie but youve had other relationships okay thats all i was going to say i didnt jump into bed with any of them either no one longterm at least sammy the first time i screwed someone on a first date i was nineteen two days later i realised that i didnt really fancy him that much but it took me six months and a lot of hassle to get shot of him ever since then ive been careful to distinguish between short and longterm things there was a time when i had the hots for andy martin given the chance id have shagged his brains out but thats all hed have wanted anyway if id slept with you right at the start then most probably it would have been all over by now the fact that im still making up my mind well thats got to be good hasnt it unless of course youre only after a quick legover yourself which im not as you well know in that case trust me for a bit longer being friends is more important than the other believe me i know that he conceded karen and i were only ever pals for all that half the force seemed to think she laughed which is maybe just as well given that you work for dcs martin and that shes mrs martin now he capitulated okay i apologise he said you are not a tease and you have our best interests at heart but you still led me on with that remark back there about stress in the command corridor come on im no security risk has big bob got another crisis on no she answered quietly in both the operational and domestic senses dcc skinner is going along relatively quietly at the moment thanks but remember i dont just work for him sammy pyes eyebrows rose as he grasped her meaning ah mr theodore chase our new acc ops is he stirring things up then she looked at him not a word outside this car mind you but is he ever come back acc elder thats the word around my office why did jim elder go in the first place it was a real shock when he chucked it i have no idea he just walked into my room one monday morning a few months back and told me that he was leaving at the end of that week no reason no nothing didnt bob skinner let anything slip not a whisper and if he wants me to know something he always tells me so i know better than to ask she sighed whatever happened now weve got the new guy god hes supercop if ever there was such a creature you know the first thing he did fired up she answered her own question he appointed jack good as his exec without consulting anyone pye gasped in surprise eh he just did it he pulled him out of his other job just like that thats right jim elder never had an exec but that didnt bother ted chase hed been through the door for no more than a fortnight before he had one the worst thing of all was that he did it while the chief was on holiday mr skinner came in one morning and found jack good in neil mcllhenneys office when he asked him what he was doing there and good told him he went straight to the accs room i was there at the time mr skinner asked him what it was all about nd mr chase as good as told him it was none of his business for a moment the dcc looked as if he was about to explode but he just turned and walked out next day he had good moved out of neils office into a room of his own neil cant stand jack good but it was on the floor below and mr chase complained to the chief when he came back so a cid man was moved out to make room for him pye frowned remind me wheredid chase come from he was an assistant chief in cumbria the job was advertised throughout britain and he applied between you and me i was surprised that mr martin didnt go for it i wasnt but never mind jesus does this guy have any idea who hes autographs in the rain taking on falling out with bob skinner ruth shrugged if he does he doesnt care youre not going to believe what the latest is chase has written a paper for the police board no one asked him to do it he just did in it he argues that the executive structure of the force is wrong and that given the nature of the chief constables duties his designated deputy from among the officers within the command ranks should be someone with extensive experience across the board meaning him you guessed it he also pointed out that hes been twice as long in the chief officer rank as mr skinner has hes after big bobs job correct but i think that ultimately hes after the chiefs the mans mad then mind you whos going to take any notice of him the joint police board might for a start the dcc has his enemies on that body more than that he thinks that mr chase has a direct route to them hes found out that he has a cousin back in cumbria whos a labour mp at westminster whats the chief saying about it ruth pursed her lips and glanced at him nothing she said hes playing it by the book when mr chase wrote his paper he sent it to him formally with a covering memo asking him to put it to the board the chief replied on paper asking whether he was sure he wanted to do that mr chase replied and said that he was a couple of days later the three of them the chief mr skinner and mr chase discussed it in private afterwards the boss told me that the chief thanked chase and said that he would consider at some length whether it should go to the board its on the shelf for the moment as far as i can gather has the big man said anything to you only that if chase thinks hes taking orders from him hes crazy she grinned that wasnt quite what he said ive left out the adjectives sammy whistled and restarted the car i see what you meant about stress levels in your corridor acc chase is either very brave or very stupid neither ruth replied at once hes simply ambitious possibly the most ambitious man ive ever met he wants to be a chief in a major force and to collect the automatic knighthood that goes with it its written all over him as for his wife qshe stopped in midsentence slamming a metaphorical door on the subject come on lets get under way again i want to get to uncle johns before dark she smiled at him again then reached out and ruffled his sandy hair this is moving our relationship forward you know quite significantly at that if i take someone to meet my favourite uncle its a sort of sign if only you could read it bugger neil swore quietly as the telephone rang lauren his daughter looked at him severely dad come on kid he appealed right in the middle of the football results thats no excuse the elevenyearold retorted do you want spence to use language like that or me even what are you talking about you do already still in his armchair he leaned across and picked up the phone hello he answered di mcllhenney a cockney voice enquired thats me hello mate this is dc crowther from the met west end central division savile row i was tryin to phone your boss but his mobile numbers unavailable he left yours as backup is that right constable the scots detective replied his hackles risen instantly then tell me something if hed answered his handphone would you have called him mate as well he paused not that im rank conscious mind he heard a distinct gulp sorry inspector its just that im not used to dealing with scotsmen dont compound it constable now whats this about i havent seen dcc skinner since he left for london on wednesday mcllhenney thought he heard a faint chuckle at the other end of the line yeah hes been busy down ere your guvnor called in a driveby shooting last night from oxford circus round about eleven he said that a lone guy took a pop at him with a shotgun from a dark coloured ford mondeo im just calling to tell him that we havent had a sniff of a result so far not a bleeding thing dc crowther coughed the thing is sir copper to copper my guvnors pissed off at your guvnor soon as his call came in last night we put a right shitload of effort into it we alerted all our patrol cars they pulled over everything within a three mile radius that even looked like a mondeo while they were doing that we had an armed robbery in a burger place in oxford street a rape behind a pub in great titchfield street and a stabbing in soho as a result of your mans call we were late responding to every one of em so we didnt feel a single collar tough youll say but then we took a look at the scene of mr skinners socalled driveby and guess what it was as clean as a whistle someone takes a shot at you with a twelvebore even if e misses youd expect to find traces of it all around crowther sighed nothing no damage to any shop windows or to the newsstand your guvnor said he dived behind and no lead shot lying around either none at all there were no witnesses either not a bleedin one the cockney seemed to hesitate for a second tell me something inspector ive heard about your man who asnt is he the nervous type not in the very slightest mcllhenney answered well my divisional commander reckons that he is he was in here this afternoon effin and blindin about wasting police time he reckons your mans shellshocked or paranoid or worse hes threatening to send a formal report to your chief and recommend that your man be made to have psych tests is that right the inspector barked just you tell him from me if you like that he should wind his bloody neck in if you dont fancy passing that on have your di do it but get your guy calmed down somehow or commander or not god help him if big bob said there was a shot fired then there was a shot fired end of story if hed been carrying himself youd have had fucking evidence all right with a bullet in it he waved an apology at lauren as she frowned at him you get that report squashed constable you do not know with whom you are dealing and i mean that til do my best sir said crowther mcllhenney was unconvinced do that by the way what team do you support eh spurs as it appens thats good they got stuffed fournil how long has your uncle lived here sammy asked as he drew up alongside the neat bungalow the last house in a leafy culdesac he and aunt cecily came to cumbernauld from glasgow when they started to build the new town in the late fifties they lived in a flat in an area called kildrum at first then moved here closer to the town centre they bought it from the development corporation about fifteen years ago just after it was refurbished they got it for a song too as sitting tenants your aunts no longer around i take it no said ruth she died of a heart attack in a year after uncle john retired hes been alone since then hell be a fair age then hes just turned eighty but hes very fit hes been a member of dullatur golf club just about all his life he plays just about every day hail rain or shine its walking distance from the house what did he do for a living something on the railways in the office at the top of buchanan street in glasgow he retired on a good pension so hes quite well off especially now that auntie isnt here to help him spend his money sammy grinned are you looking out for your inheritance then she bridled at his joke no i am not i may be the only blood relation hes got left but he could be leaving his money to the cat and dog home for all i know or care were here today because im guilty thats all i havent seen him since his last birthday in june and thats not good enough hes an old man he hardly drives any more and apart from his golfing pals hes all alone come on love he must have neighbours who look in on him or a home help or someone no not him hes a very private man always has been he opened the car door lets bring some company into his life then she smiled as she stepped out and led him up the garden path glancing around sammy noticed that the rose bushes in front of the house had gone to briar and that the beds in which they were planted were overdue for weeding old uncle johns no gardener from the look of it he muttered under his breath although the short winter evening was almost over no lights showed at the front door of the house as ruth pressed the doorbell they waited for almost a minute eventually sammy patted her on the shoulder you did call to tell him we were coming didnt you he asked she looked up at him awkwardly well no i didnt i wanted to give him a surprise great in that case the old boys probably still at the golf club no he always listens to a football match on the radio on a saturday afternoon ring the bell again in that case hes probably got the sound turned up sammy hes not in she stepped across to the uncurtained living room window and peered in i can see his hifi set and it isnt switched on maybe hes got another radio in the kitchen lets take a look round the back as she looked at him the first pang of fear shot through her okay she murmured following him as he set off down the path which ran around the house the small back garden lay to the east the dusk and the tall conifers which enclosed it on three sides made it even gloomier than the front there was no light in any of the three windows to the rear the kitchen the second bedroom or the frosted pane of the bathroom does your uncle see all right pye asked i mean would he normally have the light on at this time of day uncle johns always reading something or other he wears glasses now but his sights always been fine sammy lets go up to the golf club the old soandsos probably there right enough he held up a hand in a minute first of all he reached out and turned the handle of the back door it swung open into the kitchen god ruth snapped hes gone out and left the place unlocked she stepped past him into the kitchen and gasped looking over her shoulder sammy could see even in the dim light that the place was in chaos worse it stank of staleness dirty plates filled the sink and were strewn on the worksurface beside the cooker a badly soiled teatowel lay in the middle autographs in the rain of the floor a milk carton sat on the small table surrounded by discarded food wrappers what the hells the old bugger living like she murmured hes always struck me as such a neat man yet this is pure squalor if this is what happens when i dont warn him of a visit ill be here every saturday from now on she screwed up her face jesus the place stinks uncle john she called out listening for a few seconds before turning towards the back door come on lets go up there and find him the young detective handed her the car keys on you go ill make this place secure the front door has a yale so ill come out that way she bought the lie and did as he told her although to be sure he turned the back door key in its lock as soon as she had left the smell became more obvious as soon as he stepped out of the kitchen it was thick and cloying he had done this job before but nonetheless he was a shade fearful as he moved up the hall and opened the front bedroom door crumpled clothes were strewn all around and the bed itself was unmade its sheets so soiled and tangled that they might have won a place in a modern art exhibition but the room was empty he had seen on the way past through its open door that the second bedroom had been untouched for weeks either by duster or vacuum cleaner so that left only the bathroom hesitantly he opened the door as he did so the smell strong before seemed to wash out and over him like an ocean wave almost knocking him backwards physically he knew before he looked inside what he would find uncle john mcconnell lay full length submerged completely in his big enamelled bath he had played his last round of golf and listened to his last radio football commentary even before stepping into the bathroom pye had guessed that he had been dead for days and he had feared that he would find him in a state of hideous decomposition instead and to his surprise the old mans body was more or less intact if a strange waxy colour and if one ignored the strips of what looked like skin floating on the surface he looked almost like a statue carved out of soap the young sergeant reached across the small bathroom and opened the ventilation panel set in the window then stepped back out into the hall and closed the door behind him there was a phone in the hall he picked it up but to his surprise the line was dead instead he took out his handphone and dialled the main switchboard of his edinburgh k give me the ops room f headrters the line rang only twice becit w fficer he asked telephonist speakmg said a deep north Ñ˜ answered operations acc chase hello sir said the y voice how i mr martins office i didnt t this is spot check sergeant spot check

shes out well you better bloodv tell h emergency services descend mobndedr before the local bob skinner laughed the one place i cant be contacted neil as you well know is on gullane hill with my clubs over my shoulder if i took my mobile out on the golf course with me id soon run out of playing partners im sorry they interrupted your saturday though i didnt really expect that no problem boss my daughter was just about to bully me into doing the ironing has she not taken that over yet no she says shes too small to reach the ironing board properly she also says that she doesnt expect to be tall enough till shes about eighteen shes more like her mother every day i tell you you dont have to mate ive seen her in action he smiled briefly at the thought anyway what did this boy from the met have to tell me mcllhenney drew a breath nothing youre going to like he outlined the content of crowthers call omitting nothing when he finished there was silence from the other end of the line skinner broke it at last the bastard must have fired a blank he said firmly there was a gun neil and it was fired believe me i never doubted you for one second boss his executive assistant replied its just a pity there werent any witnesses he heard the deputy chief constable sigh aye well thats not exactly the case the fact is there was someone with me when it happened why didnt you say so then mcllhenney blurted out discretion pal discretion does the name louise bankier mean anything to you louise bankier the actress the movie star the very same lou was there she and i had just had dinner in a restaurant in soho we were looking for a taxi when the car drove by and the guy took his pop at me for all sorts of reasons i didnt want her about when the met boys arrived so i stuck her in a taxi and sent her home as soon as id called the thing in boss what the hell skinner laughed again softly at his friends incredulity was i doing up the west end with louise bankier she and i go back a long way a very long way she was just starting at glasgow university when i was in my final year she was seventeen and i was twentyone we met at the freshers fair when i was signing up new members for the squash club she joined and fortunately for the world she also joined the drama club on the same day she could play squash eff all but when it came to the acting game she wound up wangling a transfer to the athenaeum that was what they called the drama school in glasgow after her first year and shes never looked back from there i hadnt seen her in twentyfive years i followed her career of course and went to all her movies but i lost touch with her completely then last thursday i got a message at my hotel there was a piece in the evening standard about last weeks world terrorism conference she saw it and phoned the organisers they told her where i was stopping i rang her back she told me that she had called on impulse for old times sake i said i was pleased to hear from her and we arranged to have dinner last night end of story she hasnt changed a bit you know he paused no thats crap if anything shes even better looking than she was as a kid and shes developed as a person in ways i could never have imagined but i suppose we all have have we not anyway when all that nonsense happened last night i imagined what the papers would do if they got hold of it lou does not need that sort of publicity and neither do i so i got her out of the way he could almost hear mcllhenney frown boss thats improper at the very least obstructing the course of justice at the very worst i know that but ill live with it you just get back to that boy crowther and tell him from me to pass the word up his line that if his commander doesnt want his gonads fricasseed hell pull that bullshit report of his ive told him that already mind you he wasnt certain that it could be done skinner sighed again til deal with that if it happens the thing is neil he went on louise is not the only one i need to protect from too much press interest autographs in the rain apart from the gunshot sure as hell she doesnt need to know about that theres nothing that sarah doesnt know you understand she was aware that i was meeting lou all right i told her as soon as it was arranged but she wouldnt be best pleased either if the wrong sort of stuff appeared in the papers the truth is that if any smart hacks did some digging even though itd mean going back a quarter of a century there would still be plenty of people around to tell them that louise bankier and i were more than just squash partners theodore chase gazed down the driveway of the police headquarters building normally every parking bay would have been occupied and the street outside even the school playground beyond would have been thronged with vehicles but on a sunday afternoon most of the cars he could see belonged to shoppers at the nearby supermarket he stood in ruth mcconnells tiny office flicking through her intrays of which she had two his own which was empty awaiting the monday morning mail delivery and bob skinners which was piled high with papers waiting for the attention of the dcc on his return from the london conference ted chase enjoyed lurking around empty offices as he put it to himself there was something about them they seemed to him to be possessed by the auras of the people who occupied them through the week each with its own unique signature take ruth mcconnells small room as an example she used the same fragrance as his wife rive gauche whatever that meant not that his nose would have told him that for his sense of smell had been deadened by growing up close to a brewery since coming to edinburgh he had discovered that he could even drive through seafield without the faintest wrinkle of his nose he picked up the familiar blue eau de toilette tube glanced at it then put it back on the desk carefully on its side in its original position he closed his eyes and he could feel her presence could see her in his mind as clearly as if she was really sat there long legs under her chair close fitting skirt moulded to her thighs riding just above the knee her white blouse tucked into the waistband covering the faintest roll of flesh he let his mind roam further until he could actually feel the residual warmth of her body in the room and sense the strength of her personality filling its every corner in spite of himself he began to imagine her naked hair tousled glowing after sex and then there was someone else in his vision sammy pye no autographs in the rain not the young sergeant someone bigger older stronger grimmer frightening as his head seemed to turn towards the intruder bob skinner ted chase opened his eyes wide and was a shade embarrassed to find that he was breathing slightly heavily he thought of skinner and ruth they had worked together for a few years now she was a woman and a half he had a past that had made the tabloids he couldnt believe that she would settle for a lad like pye there had to be something there for sure he was startled when the phone rang on ruths desk for a second he thought about letting it go unanswered but that was against his nature somehow it would have made him feel like a sneak he picked it up and was taken aback to hear bob skinners strong steady voice afternoon ted he began his tone was neutral neither friendly nor hostile your wife told me id probably find you in the office chase waited for the dcc to ask what the hell he was doing there as probably he would have done himself in reversed circumstances when he did not he felt almost a sense of letdown ive had a call from ruthie he continued instead asking if it would be all right for her to have a couple of days off her uncles died and she has to make all the funeral arrangements and stuff yes said chase abruptly i knew about that i was in the ops room yesterday afternoon when martins man pye called in after finding the body he heard a soft chuckle at the other end how the fuck did we manage without you ted i really dont know the acc felt himself flush im still getting the feel of the place bob thats all you could have fooled me mate but lets not get into that i told her that it was okay and that id square it with you yes of course in the circumstances its okay with me thats good as it happens the chiefs chairing an acpos committee meeting in glasgow tomorrow so gerry crossleyll have some time on his hands we wont be neglected ah yes chase did not approve of male secretaries and could never keep the distaste out of his tone whenever the efficient young crossleys name came up in conversation hes a good lad ted skinner said quietly as you might find out for yourself one day see you tomorrow there was a click the line went dead then buzzed as the cumbrian stared at the receiver taken offguard by his colleagues throwaway remark it wasnt that he disliked bob skinner chase told himself as he replaced the receiver he was an affable enough bloke it wasnt that he was jealous of him he took enough pride in his own career achievements not to feel jealous of anyone it wasnt that he doubted his ability he was one of the most famous policemen in the country and the queens police medal wasnt awarded lightly no he told himself his concern was based on his distinguished colleagues attitude to the book there were accepted ways of policing and these had been developed practically over many years the relationship between police and public in the eyes of theodore chase was one in which the uniformed body had to stand aloof to command the respect which he saw as essential to efficient operation nevertheless by no means did he see himself as being stuck in the past he approved wholeheartedly of the new style of uniform which was more comfortable and had been designed to meet modern needs he recognised the value of the panda car although he stuck to the view that walking the beat still had its place especially in the inner city areas his problem with bob skinner was simply that he seemed to see it all differently for example the man had a littledisguised dislike of wearing the uniform so littledisguised that it was a standing joke throughout headquarters chase saw the dark blue tunic as the basic symbol of authority for example for his saturday dropin to the ops room he had worn it a quiet sunday in the office well that was something else skinner had an overtly sloppy attitude to reporting channels also it was one thing for acc operations to pay unannounced visits to his own ops room to keep everyone on their toes but quite another for the dcc to involve himself in active criminal investigations there was even a story about him taking his baby son on a stakeout of premises in the course of a hunt for a murder suspect then there was his lax attitude to rank he accepted that it was for the chief constable to determine whether he and his two assistants should be on firstname terms behind closed doors as they were however skinners easy familiarity with the men under his command posed in his view a clear and present danger to good discipline he and di mcllhenney played football in the same fiveaside group every thursday and sometimes chase understood his daughter babysat the mcllhenney autographs in the rain children to allow them to do it he and dcs martin had a fraternal rapport so much so that skinner had been best man at the head of cids wedding he allowed mcguire the special branch man virtually open access to his office there were only two lines in chases controversial paper on the forces command structure to which the dcc had taken outright exception one had been a reference to the cult of the personality as he had put it and that was at the heart of his problem with skinner he would not did not dare suggest that the big scot had built his own legend deliberately no he accepted that he was trapped within it yet that was the greatest obstacle to his efficiency as a chief police officer the book of proper policing ted chases imaginary bible had been written by many people over many years it had come under attack in a variety of ways from direct assault by terrorism to insidious undermining tactics by those people to whom chase referred most commonly as liberals yet as he saw it the solid dependable man and yes now he had to concede woman in uniform still stood in spite of it all as the cornerstone of society image and perception were allimportant no personality could be allowed to overshadow either yet that was what skinner seemed to do he was rarely seen in public in uniform he was not the chief constable and yet whenever anyone in edinburgh anyone in scotland probably many people in england perhaps thought of a policeman they were likely to think of him in his heart of hearts ted chase disapproved of devolution he was british first cumbrian second and like many of his compatriots english third he had a niggling fear of anything which threatened the composition of the flag he saluted and a downright dislike of anything which claimed to be an alternative to the national anthem which he took pride in bellowing lustily on public occasions however he had accepted the political situation and the prospect of working in a devolved scotland when he had decided to apply for the edinburgh job he had reasoned that it gave him his best chance of rising to command his own force now that he was in place he had come to realise how different scotland was and how great was its potential for change virtually all of its institutions were under the control of a new breed of politician able to tackle their manifesto objectives with none of the constraints of parliamentary time which had bedevilled the old scottish office at westminster in particular he had come to realise how easy it would be for his own views on policing which had held sway under the old regime to be swept away by the new administration which he saw as a softcentred coalition committed to reform for its own sake nothing was beyond them and who better to serve as a model for a new scottish breed of policeman than the homebred hero dcc robert morgan skinner chase was nobodys fool he saw the danger more clearly than the man himself and there he saw also might lie the saving grace skinners intense dislike of politicians was a matter of record certainly within the police force and to an extent in the wider world thanks to the circumstances which had led to his giving up his former responsibility as security adviser to the secretary of state yet what political power he could command through his reputation and his public profile if only he realised it thank god the acc thought that he doesnt he was so immersed in contemplation that he gave a small involuntary jump when the phone rang for a second time he picked it up expecting skinner once again only to hear the voice of the security man on weekend duty at the main entrance theres a ups guy here sir wi a delivery for the chief constable since youre here dae you want to sign for it the acc frowned i suppose so ill be down in a moment he left his secretarys office and walked briskly along the command corridor then down a flight of stairs which led more or less directly to the front door the brownsuited messenger stood waiting with a big brown envelope and the inevitable clipboard print your name there sir then sign ablow it he said chase made a mental note of yet another scots word and did as the man asked thanking him as he took the package he glanced at it as he walked back upstairs his curiosity aroused the address was clear and simple chief constable sir james proud qpm police headquarters fettes avenue edinburgh and it bore two red stamped injunctions one urgent the other confidential but not personal he murmured to himself as he stood at gerry crossleys desk holding the envelope poised over the intray and bob did say that the chief isnt in tomorrow he picked up a letteropener slit the envelope open and slid out its autographs in the rain contents three a pages stapled together with a covering letter on metropolitan police notepaper he was frowning as he began to read by the time he was finished he was wideeyed and his mouth was hanging open in astonishment was that the first time youd ever seen anything like that sam detective chief superintendent andy martin asked his aide not the first time ive ever seen a body sir the recently promoted sergeant replied you know what its like when youre in uniform one way or another you have to look at quite a few he shuddered looking older suddenly than his twentyseven years but its the first time ive ever seen one like that in that condition i mean lying there in the bath the poor old bugger looked like his face twisted as he struggled to find words like a statue like a tailors dummy like something that never had been human it wasnt gross boss not like something i saw once when an old lady had died in front of an electric fire and lain there for about a week there werent any maggots in the eye sockets nothing like that but in its own way it was pretty horrible for all that did ruth see him no way when i told her i had to hold her back from going into the bathroom but i did she gave me bloody hell at the time but calmed down pretty quickly no nightmares i wouldnt know sir said pye abruptly i didnt mean her you clown the head of cid chuckled the young sergeant flushed embarrassed by his revealing slip no sir not me you will have sammy you will martin murmured his smile gone he had known his own nocturnal horrors happily marriage seemed to be holding them at bay til be ready for them then no you wont no one ever is pye looked across at his boss then changed the subject hows karen doing still being sick autographs in the rain no thank christ he replied sincerely she seems to have stopped barfing up her breakfast shes blooming mate blooming shes not showing yet but it wont be long he picked up a pile of papers from his desk and walked across to the meeting table this is todays agenda then yes sir okay then on you go and see if the troops are here if they are wheel them in the head of cids monday briefing with his six divisional commanders was a practice established by bob skinner and carried on by his successors roy old and andy martin its main purpose was to keep the chief superintendent abreast of all active investigations but it was useful also in that it could reveal patterns of crime across the force area and not least in the platform which it provided for fresh thinking on stalled cases this one was special though as the six senior detectives took their places at the table there was one among them who stood out from the rest she was the only woman among the six trimly built attractive in her thirties with flaming red hair which shone under the neon strip lighting but more than that there was a presence about her a bearing which could not help but say to the rest dont take me lightly ive made it this far and i may have further to go martin stood as the rest composed themselves and as sammy pye took his seat on his right notepad at the ready to take down the bullet points of the meeting he looked along the table and smiled id like to begin this mornings meeting gentlemen by welcoming a newcomer in our midst okay i know shes been here before on occasion as brian mackies deputy but this is her first meeting as commander of central division cid only the second woman to hold such a post in the history of our force congratulations mags youve earned your place here by being an outstanding detective as well as a good leader im looking forward to your contribution over the months to come detective superintendent maggie rose looked up at the head of cid and smiled faintly wondering whether any of the others had read anything into his timeframe thank you sir im honoured to be here i know i have a lot to learn but im surrounded by good teachers her promotion had come about following the retirement of superintendent john mcgrigor from the command of the borders division martin and bob skinner feeling that a veteran would fill the vacancy best had decided to move dan pringle south and to promote rose into his post in central edinburgh martin laughed out loud youre off to a good start flattery will get you everywhere with these guys she looked back at him and noted yet again the change in him the strungout bitter man of a few months earlier had gone returned was the laidback unflappable pleasant colleague she had come to know and respect over the years okay said the head of cid taking his seat to business he glanced along at dan pringle i see from your first report from the borders that youve been making an impact i know that big mcgrigor had trouble with the odd sheepstealer but what the hells this trout rustling the big superintendent hunched his shoulders and tugged at the heavy moustache which seemed to give him a permanently mournful look pour scorn on me if you like andy he muttered but its been a crime waiting to happen aye waiting for you by the looks of it have you taken some of your old customers down there with you is that it maybe from what john told me in our handover theyve a pretty poor and unimaginative bunch of hooligans down there theyve got a long history of practically signing their names to every crime thats committed not this one though this was very professional very efficient it happened at a big trout farm just off the st boswells to kelso road the manager lives on site but he was away on friday and saturday nights when he went in yesterday morning just to check that the automatic feeders and water pumps were all right he found that all the bloody tanks had been emptied how for gods sake chuckled superintendent brian mackie how do you nick a shoal of bloody fish good question son pringle grunted the very question i asked gates the manager and the answer it seems is that you drive a bloody big vehicle in there stick a widemouthed pipe in each of the tanks and pump out water fish and all jesus mackie whispered his colleague raised an eyebrow in his general direction these boys lifted far more fish than the lord had to work with this farm mellerkirk its called is one of the biggest in the region they supply two big autographs in the rain supermarket chains on a daily basis plus they run their own smoking business all joking aside the thefts a disaster for them theyre restocking from their hatchery as fast as they can but itll be a week or so before they can restart production what quantity of fish are we talking about asked rose mr gates couldnt say for sure but he guessed around three tons three tons martin exclaimed what the hells anyone going to do with three tons of hot fish freeze it pringle replied youd have to anyone trying to shift that amount in one lot would draw attention to themselves pretty quick sounds like a wellplanned operation then apart from having the equipment to hoover up the stock theyd surely have to have someone ready to receive and handle it aye thats right sir theyd have to do it right away too gates said that the fish would start dying pretty quick in those conditions he reckoned that theyd have been driven straight to a processor for treatment but where thats anyones guess what are you doing about finding out asked the head of cid weve put together a list offish processors all over scotland and were circulating it to all relevant forces this morning as soon as thats done ill want people going round all of the places on our patch ill need assistance from other divisions that means you brian you greg and you willie he looked across the table at detective superintendent gregory jay and william michaels who commanded the leith and west lothian cid areas respectively what are our chances dan slim and none boss its no as if these bloody fish carry the owners brand or anything one deid trout looks just like another i dont suppose for a minute that theyll show up in the major supermarket chains they all vet their suppliers pretty thoroughly well just have to keep an eye on the smaller outlets and hope but if these boys are as smart as they look theyll keep the stuff in a freezer for a while till the heats off you might say then shift it in small quantities one thing we can do martin suggested and thats let the central intelligence unit know so that every fish farm in scotland can be put on the alert pringle nodded i did that yesterday good man said the head of cid he ran his fingers through his curly blond hair and chuckled softly what a start to the week three tons of hot frozen fish welcome to the madhouse maggie bob skinner had an aversion to st andrews house the monolithic grey stone office building which housed many of the civil servants involved in the business of governing scotland nevertheless there were times when he had no choice but to swallow his dislike and visit the place with sir james proud engaged in a meeting with his fellow chief constables in glasgow it fell to him to represent the force on an ad hoc committee set up by the scottish executive to plan a new crime prevention publicity campaign the big detective had serious doubts over the cost effectiveness of governmentfunded media propaganda he believed firmly that the whole exercise smacked of tokenism a kneejerk action by politicians who suspected probably in error that the public expected it of them in his experience the messages washed over the heads of most of the honest citizens at whom they were aimed while criminals were either too stupid to take notice of the warnings or too intelligent to watch the television programmes on which they were normally screened however the first minister and his lackey the justice minister had decreed that it should be done and had appointed sir james proud to chair the working group which would make it happen the meeting when finally it began after a preamble of coffee and chat was happily brief the scottish executive information departments head of publicity acting as secretary to the committee introduced a hapless advertising agency team who presented proposals which impressed none of the five policemen gathered around the table and were sent away to think again skinner smiled as he stepped through the great doorway of the building which stood on the site of the old city jail glad to be rid of an unwelcome chore he was still nodding grinning unconsciously as he looked into gerry crossleys office and offered the young man a brisk good morning good morning sir the chief constables secretary replied but with a frown acc chase asked if you would look in on him when you got in aye sure the dcc replied mail first though gerry eh is it all in my office or has neil got it mr chase told me to leave it where it was sir he wants to see you right away tell him to go and fuck himself skinner stilled the retort on the launch pad instead eyes narrowing slightly he said simply tell him ill be in my room then get me my mail very good sir crossley was reaching for his telephone even as the big detective left the office he had only just hung up his jacket and settled into his chair when there was a knock at the door before he could reply it opened and ted chase strode into the room brushing aside the chief constables secretary almost knocking to the floor skinners pile of mail which he was carrying not bothering to suppress his sigh the dcc stood up and pointed to the low leather sofas in one corner of the big panelled room ted he snapped testily sit your arse down there gerry thanks son just put that lot on my desk then leave us chase was still standing as crossley left the room skinner looked at him frowning as he poured two mugs of coffee manners matter you know he said gerrys a civilian employee you wouldnt barge past a uniformed officer like that and you sure as hell dont do it to him chase seemed to relax his ramrod stance just a fraction sorry he conceded its just that well i was expecting you earlier skinner felt his temper rise in earnest he made a conscious effort to control it and almost succeeded listen he hissed icily as far as i know i dont report to you not yet at any rate you want to know where i am ask mcllhenney he always knows you want to see me just ask dont summon me and dont lurk behind my fucking door okay i wont be intimidated bob the acc countered the big detective shook his steelgrey head im not trying to intimidate you i wouldnt youre a brother officer i am simply telling you a couple of things that will make it easier for us to get on tact and diplomacy can be bloody difficult for career coppers like us jimmy has them both in abundance thats what makes him so good but we need to show them some time autographs in the rain he smiled forcing himself to be conciliatory anyway whats the problem man i hadnt put you down as a panic merchant he handed him one of the mugs look sit down and tell me about it chase shifted a document to his left hand as he took the coffee whats that asked skinner its what i have to talk to you about believe me bob when you see it youll see that i was being tactful he handed the paper over as he settled himself into one of the low sofas it arrived by special messenger yesterday afternoon it was addressed to the chief and it was stamped as urgent in his absence and in yours i deemed it proper to open it read it the dcc took the document private and confidential he read to chief constable sir james proud from assistant commissioner hector plumpton sir i regret to have to make a formal report to you regarding an incident which took place in regent street just after pm last friday bugger it he shouted throwing the paper on to the coffee table i know what this is i had wind of it at the weekend and i asked neil to try to put a stop to it obviously someone in london didnt get the message be that as it may yes its a complaint bob a complaint against a senior officer your senior officer be that as it may too ill even forget your admission that you tried to have it suppressed skinner had given up the fight against his temper suppressed if i had known the man would be that stupid well he has been now what are we going to do about it we are going to do eff all you are going to give that piece of shit to proud jimmy to whom it was addressed in the first place but he wont be back till tomorrow aye so chase pushed himself to his feet and walked across to the window do i have to spell it out that report questions your fitness for duty it recommends that you be given a psychiatric assessment in those circumstances is it right that you continue in acting command of this force even for a single day what would you do if you were in my place id sit you down and ask you what happened then id accept your word then youd be in default of your duty listen help me keep this thing inhouse let me call someone in right now to have a talk with you omalley for example hes our top consultant isnt he thatll be the end of it skinner looked him in the eye unblinking you try that and itll be the end of you pal no one not even kevin is rummaging around in my head not ever ill tell you something ted for all your gauche attempts to take over my job i respect you as a sincere man thats why you havent made an enemy of me believe me and this is not intimidation you dont want to then help me deal with this okay the dcc stood took two steps across to his desk and picked up the phone gerry he said i want to speak to the commissioner of the metropolitan police he put the instrument down then sat in silence in his swivel chair waiting it was over a minute before it rang again skinner picked it up his expression stony paddy bob here he began good to speak to you too yes i thought last week was a great success well done to your people for setting it up listen ive got a problem up here that you can sort for me with one phone call last friday night i reported an incident in regent street he paused you heard about it then did you know that one of your acs a guy called plumpton has written to jimmy making a formal complaint against me on the ground of wasting police time yup thats right ive got it on my desk right now watching chase saw him give a tight unconscious smile no well youd better fucking believe it ill fax it to you if you like it says that there was no evidence to back up my report and goes on to suggest that im a fucking nut case well maybe i am but someone discharged a shotgun in my direction for sure if id caught him id have asked him if he had fired a blank but probably not until after id killed him what would i like you to do id like you to send me assistant commissioner plumptons head on a plate failing that id like an immediate letter to jimmy withdrawing that report and a personal letter from the man apologising for doubting the word of a fellow officer if his signatures in autographs in the rain blood ill accept it with good grace he paused then smiled broadly this time aye okay ill do without the blood but thanks for the rest i appreciate it so will louise aye she was there you understand why i got her off the scene right away sure for the best and mine to eleanor so long skinners smile disappeared as he replaced the receiver and looked across at chase there you are ted im off the hook and so are you ill keep that nonsense and give it to jimmy himself have you spoken to anyone else about it no the acc replied not even crossley fine thats how itll stay then the reference to someone called louise what was that about my business if its all the same to you the commissioner knew about it because his car dropped me off in shaftesbury avenue after the closing session of the conference okay if you say so but bob what about the incident itself arent you concerned that someone shot at you even if it was a blank sure im concerned but theres nothing i can do about it not unless and until the guy comes back for another go it could have been anything ted the conference was publicised the chances are that some clown with a grudge against authority read about it in the evening standard and decided to stage a stunt make a point whatever can you remember anything about him the dcc snorted well seen no ones ever shot at you mate when it happens all you can see is the fucking gun no no one ever has im glad to say but then im not your sort of policeman no youre not are you youll never be like me nor i like you which is just as well for the sake of good order we need traditionalists in the force guys like you and jimmy whove at home in a uniform as well as doorkickersin like me and mcllhenney and martin i suppose chase interjected no no andys inherently a manager hes better than i was as head of cid he lets the divisional heads do their job i was always out there leading the charge i still am on occasion i cant help it skinner wandered back to the sofas and sat down picking up his lukewarm coffee you still after my job then he asked casually bob the acc protested its not that i believe in that paper i wrote its honest at least give me that sure and you have ambitions give me that i cant deny it whats wrong with that not a bloody thing i have some of those too i just keep them close no thats not what worries me about you to be frank i think youre a zealot zeal and ambition can be a terrifying combination especially in senior policemen oh aye and generals he took a sip from his mug ever heard of matthew hopkins no policeman no general then sort of three hundred and fifty years ago he styled himself the witch finder general he ran a personal crusade in england against witchcraft he went from village to village uncovering socalled necromancers torture was forbidden even then so he tended to use socalled bloodless methods sleep deprivation mainly you could say he was ahead of his time to extract confessions from his victims up to four hundred innocent people were hanged because of him in only a few years actually hopkins did it for money but it was his zeal that let him get away with it he commanded authority but chase spluttered comically in spite of himself skinner laughed its okay im not saying youre another hopkins but you seem to me to have the zealots belief in the way things should be i dont see any bending in you no compromise i dont compromise my beliefs no but are you tolerant of those of others i dont think so does that matter if youre right skinner threw back his head extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice he quoted barry goldwater said that in happily the electorate didnt agree with him and he didnt become president of the united states its not so well remembered that he also said in the same speech that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue as a philosophy thats even more dangerous to civil liberties know what his campaign slogan was in your heart you know hes right you see i believe that at heart youre a goldwater republican ted autographs in the rain and i wont have one of them running this force either as chief or deputy not never not nohow can you prevent it i think so i have my own constituency and its pretty powerful as perhaps youve just seen the dcc stood once more now with all that clear maybe you and i can just accept that we have fundamental differences in our beliefs and use the contrast between us if we can to help us work together in the best interests of this force and the people it serves sammy pye watched the door close on the last of the divisional commanders then switched on his computer to begin typing up his meeting note the session had gone on for longer than usual thanks mainly to the extended brainstorming over the missing fish he had just booted up microsoft word and opened a customised template when the phone rang ds pye he announced still feeling a prickle of pride at his new rank sam thank goodness youre there one of the things he loved about ruth was her assuredness naturally she had been upset when he had gone out to the car in cumbernauld to break the bad news about her uncle there had been tears when he had told her there had been anger when he had prevented her from going into the bathroom there had been selfrecrimination when he had told her that the old man appeared to have been dead for some time but it all had passed over and the selfpossessed woman had reasserted herself quickly staying calm as the duty doctor and the police had arrived even as the paramedics took the body off to the mortuary now he picked up the tension in her tone at once whats up love he asked its the police theyre being difficult they wont let me make arrangements for uncle johns funeral eh why the hell not thats just it they wont tell me i dont like it sam they wont tell me anything theres even worse than that too i went to cumbernauld this morning to uncle johns house to start looking through his papers there were police there and they wouldnt let me in honestly the way theyre acting its as if they suspected me of something pye frowned so hard that he felt the muscles bunch in his forehead where are you right now autographs in the rain im in what passes for a town centre in cumbernauld im going to go up to dullatur golf club to see if i can find any of uncle johns cronies there maybe they can tell me something about him when was the last time they saw him whether hed been complaining of feeling unwell that sort of stuff no the young detective said sharply dont do that please why not because it wouldnt be helpful listen ruthie like i told you on saturday when someone dies alone under any circumstances technically the police have to be called and they have to make a report to the fiscal quite often thats overlooked if the local gp is sympathetic and wants to spare a bereaved wife or husband from any more distress hell just certify death as if hes been there we know that and we dont bother about it but when someones died and lain undiscovered for a few days thats a different matter the police will be called and they will make a report what theyre doing now is probably just routine then why wont they let me into the house pye chewed his lip that i dont understand i admit possibly the local inspectors just an officious bastard no probably he is chances are thats the only reason but if you go up to the golf club youll be doing something that the police may have done already or worse may still have to do give it up for today just go home he heard her sigh okay she conceded t will come and see me after work sure he paused and chuckled can i bring my toothbrush there was a silence on the line okay said ruth eventually but only if you bring your shaving kit as well im funny about morning stubble mmm he said replacing the phone quickly it took a conscious effort to force his mind back to the job and to the minute of the mornings meeting nevertheless he succeeded he deciphered his notes quickly and had almost finished transcribing them when the phone rang once again ds pye that flash of pride again sammy this is superintendent rose are you alone christ he thought my lucky day autographs in the rain i mean are you free to speak yes maam why because something very odd has happened and i thought id talk to you about it before i did anything my duty cid team here in torphichen place has just had a call from the cid in n division of strathclyde police cumbernauld office fortunately ray wilding took the call himself someone else might not have twigged to the name sam the strathclyde boys have asked that we pick up ruth mcconnell and deliver her to them for questioning about a suspicious death do you know what this is about jesus pye exploded some bastards going really over the top now the socalled suspicious death is ruthies uncle we found him on saturday when we went to visit him mr chase knows about it he was in the ops room on saturday and he called out the local police for me the old gaffer took a heart attack or something similar in his bath thats all there was to it the strathclyde lot are being really heavyhanded maam they wouldnt let ruthie into the house when she went through this morning shes not at work no the boss gave her the day off to make funeral arrangements and start tidying up the old boys affairs leave it to me maam ill speak to mr martin or mr skinner one of themll squash strathclyde no sergeant they wont this is my divisional responsibility and im not beginning my tenure of office by showing favouritism or by getting a name in a neighbouring force of some weak woman who passes tough decisions up the ladder if the cumbernauld cid want to interview ruth thats their right in the circumstances whether theyre being officious or not where is she right now do you know i hope shes driving back through to edinburgh does she have a mobile yes okay heres what ill do i will call n division back and tell them that i dont have the resources to spare officers to act as delivery boys ill tell them that they can interview ruth at this office at five oclock you call her and tell her to report here in time make sure that she does mind pye felt anger rumbling up in him but he suppressed it he knew enough jl not to shout at maggie rose very good maam can i sit in on the interview i shouldnt think so for one minute but you can be here from what you say they should really be interviewing you as well you did the right thing maggie dont worry about it i appreciate your phoning to tell me about it but the decision was yours all the way and your assessment of the situation is spot on you can rest assured that i wont go snarling at anyone through in lanarkshire either i promise you ill keep my hands off this one completely all the same bob skinner continued when the strathclyde officers get to your place i want them to be bloody clear as to who it is theyve come to interview i cant fault anybody for just doing their job even if they are insensitive enough to ask for a bereaved relative to be brought to them for interview but if i find out afterwards that theyve been discourteous or aggressive to ruth in any way then i will have their tripes for supper and no mistake the superintendent smiled gently til explain the background just as you say sir dont worry you do that who knows they might even invite you to sit in on their interview dont let pye anywhere near it though in fact once hes dropped ruthie off send him packing tell him youll give her a lift home once theyre finished with her you dont want him pacing the corridor outside the interview room youre right i dont i remember how mario was when i got hurt and i remember thinking that it was just as well brian mackie had the bloke who did it locked up in a cell by the same token the idea of having a serving officer in the building while his girlfriends being interviewed even if it is a formality does not appeal to me too many potential complications she paused i suppose it is a formality she said tentatively of course it is the dcc responded at once then he too hesitated theyre being heavyhanded about it right enough but im sure thats all it is still its unusual for someone to be brought in for interview in a runofthemill sudden autographs in the rain death investigation yes it is you know mags with every minute that passes this is becoming more difficult for me as ruths boss and more than that as her friend i want to pick up the phone call the officer in charge of this investigation and ask him what the bloody hell hes playing at yet as the dcc i cant be seen to be leaning on another force especially not at this time she caught his veiled meaning if jock govan was still in the chiefs chair in glasgow he continued it would be okay i could just have called him or even willie haggerty if he hadnt been moved back into uniform as a divisional gaffer but i dont know the new guy yet so i have to be careful not to provoke any diplomatic incidents ive already had to defuse one bomb today i dont fancy handling another why dont you ask mr chase to make enquiries are you being mischievous detective superintendent rose skinner snorted i dont believe in introducing foxes to chicken coops and thats all im saying no well just have to be patient if we want to find out whether theres anything sinister behind this request it does help having them on our turf though in what way well not interfering in advance of the interview is one thing but afterwards dont worry sir these people wont leave this office without me knowing what all this is about good for you keep me in touch the dcc hung up the phone and returned to the pile of papers through which he had been wading when rose had called there was nothing there of any drama or import over the previous few months the force had gone through a period of calm almost unprecedented in recent years it had been so quiet that skinner had even taken to reviewing old and unsolved investigations reading the notes to see if anything caught his eye in a way that might offer a new line of inquiry the latest of these the file on the unsolved murder of two teenage girls still lay on his desk he glanced at it and was reaching for it when the phone rang again yes neil he said knowing that it would be mcllhenney on the other end of the line call for you boss on your number almost invariably calls for skinner came through ruth mcconnells extension yes remember the lady you mentioned to me on saturday its her do you want to talk to her course i do put her through he leaned back in his chair hearing the click on the line hi lou he began what a surprise right on cue too my day was beginning to drag what can i do for you nothing really i just wanted to talk to you to make sure you were all right after friday night i suppose i guessed that you wouldnt have given me this number if you didnt want me to call so yeah sure but never mind how am did you get back home okay ad are you all right its me should have phoned you really after chucking you as broad as youre long down regent street her deep throaty laugh sent a warm familiar feeling down his spine youre forgiven just like old times in a way im fine honestly you owe me a pair of tights and a cleaners bill for one dior jacket but apart from that tell me she asked with sudden concern did the police catch the man hah the police didnt even believe that there was a man there were no signs of a gunshot at the scene the borough commander got very humpty dumpty about it but thats ridiculous there was a shot i heard it i saw the car drive away and i saw you chase it ill bloody well call and tell them no lou you wont that would not be a good idea not at all dont you worry about old humpty hes fallen off his wall since then all the kings horses and all the kings men are looking for the bits even now as for the incident itself im not worried about it london can be a wild place at night any city can chances are it was a random thing some cowboy who gets a buzz out of scaring the posh people up the west end it happens why dont i believe you believe that because of who i am thats all its as likely an explanation as any but not the only one no but really lou dont concern yourself because big tough bob can take care of himself sure you can you always could even at university but ive read about you i didnt tell you on friday but ive followed your career ever since you began to get your autographs in the rain name in the papers remember lucy my sister she was only a toddler when you and i were going out together but shes kept me in touch with your adventures over the years i know about some of the scrapes youve been in like that time when you were stabbed and almost killed you probably didnt even know this but while you were in hospital your wife had a delivery of a bouquet of red roses there was no card but they were from me youre not a cat bob you dont have nine lives too damn right ill concern myself even though ill concede that friday night probably had nothing to do with your past he scratched his chin god do that speech in an upstate new york accent and youd sound just like sarah shes welcome ill tell you something my love its great to havra past with a man like you but i dont envy sarah the present thats comforting to know in that case you wont want to have dinner with me again when im in london after the new year i didnt say that actually youll have an opportunity before then unless you dont want to be seen with me in scotland that is ive been offered the lead in a new movie and its going to be shot in scotland i get to play a lady lawyer involved in some sort of shenanigans ive only just been sent the script im coming up to edinburgh on friday im meeting the director and the executive producer in the balmoral then being driven round the locations okay he responded if youre free in the evening lets have dinner but why dont we do it at my place you can meet sarah and give her your sympathies you can tell her about the roses too if you like if you take the part youd better meet my daughter as well shes a lady lawyer shell help you research it he heard her draw in her breath are you sure about that introducing me to sarah that is sure im sure are you up for it yes she said firmly a decision made thank you id like that okay its a date ill collect you from the balmoral around six is this normal practice with you cid people ruth mcconnell was bristling with anger as she stood on the pavement staring at the entrance to the torphichen place police office as she turned her fury on sammy pye he had a mental picture of his toothbrush standing alone in its glass beside his bathroom mirror no it isnt he assured her but different forces do things in different ways these people are sticklers and theres nothing i can do about that she was only slightly mollified okay i wont blame you all the same this is ridiculous telling me to report to them indeed why couldnt they have come to see me at home thats what youd do in the same circumstances isnt it pye was inwardly thankful that he had not told her of the original request from the strathclyde officers that she be brought to their office sure it is love he answered but like i said i cant speak for these punters she shook her long shimmering hair and straightened her back oh well she snapped were here now so lets get it over with then maybe i can get on with burying my poor uncle where do we go t we to take you to maggie roses office he held the door to the building open for her will you come with me when i see them i dont think theyll allow that she stopped in her tracks what in that case im not going to speak to them take me home right now ruthie he pleaded dont be difficult if i was them i wouldnt want a man from another force sitting in either but ive told you its just a routine interview so come on she shot him a look okay but you be here when theyre finished with me autographs in the rain i will be dont worry weve got a date remember what oh yes well see how i feel after this who knows i might be right off policemen by then he knew that she was serious as he led her up the stairway which led to the cid suite rapping on the divisional commanders door and stepping inside on her call maam ruths here maggie rose looked at him unsmiling and at his companion as she stepped into the room thats good right on time the redhaired detective superintendent nodded in the direction of two visitors who stood beside her desk a man and a woman these are our colleagues from strathclyde detective inspector mackenzie and ds dell people this is ds pye and this is the lady you want to see she looked at them her expression suddenly sharp this summons had better be justified otherwise you might find yourself having to explain to ms mcconnells boss as the tall dark mackenzie smiled his face took on an expression of pure menace pye took an instant dislike to him and wondered if after all he should force his way into the interview and whos that the man asked dcc skinner rose replied youll have heard of him aye vaguely mackenzie chuckled have you an interview room for us use this office we need a tape maam this is an official interview pye knew rose well enough to read the sign as her eyes narrowed very well she said icily ruth would you like me to sit in with you i dont know if we can have that maam inspector she snapped in my station youll have what i tell you ruth the woman shook her head thanks maggie but its all right i just want out of here with a minimum of fuss okay mackenzie theres a vacant interview room at the end of the corridor use that and bring ms mcconnell back here when youre finished the big detective chuckled again aye well have to see about that too maam pye took half a pace towards him until a glance from rose stopped him in his tracks instead he stood aside and allowed the strathclyde officers to escort ruth out of the office theres something about that bastard maggie rose murmured as the door closed on the trio that reminds me of flash donaldson and we know all too well about him the interview room was three doors along the corridor detective sergeant dell held the door open for the other woman and ushered her inside the only furniture was a table upon which there sat a black tape recorder and four chairs two each on opposite sides sit down said mackenzie curtly he took a tape cassette from his pocket slipped it into one of the twin slots of the recorder and switched it on the interviewee sat down with her back to the door laid her handbag on the table then delved into it finally satisfied she produced a tissue and settled back into her chair the inspector stared across at her coldly this interview is being held at torphichen place police office edinburgh at five ten pm on november i am detective inspector david mackenzie n division strathclyde police also present are detective sergeant gwendoline dell and miss ruth mcconnell then he astonished ruth by reading her a formal caution what the devil she exploded quiet please miss mcconnell barked mackenzie youll answer questions only not ask them the hell with that have i been arrested here and why should you be she blazed back at him dont fence with me for that bloody tape whats my status here mackenzie nodded a concession for the record you are here voluntarily to assist our investigation into the suspicious death of your uncle john mcconnell of number fifteen glenlaverock grove cumbernauld suspicious what do you mean the detective reached across and hit the stop button on the recorder there you go with the questions again listen mcconnell i dont care whose fucking secretary you are as far as im concerned youre just another fucking suspect you know what my nickname is they call me bandit not just the other coppers but our local villains too and believe me through in the west we have some real villains not like the poofs he laughed suddenly harshly oh aye and fucking fish rustlers you lot have through here its a mark of respect so they tell me they call me that because im a bad bastard and because ill nick anyone they say about some coppers that theyd lift their own brothers i did autographs in the rain once so be advised behave yourself and dont try to pull rank or influence on me he switched on the recorder once again now if youre ready miss mcconnell she looked at him then turned her head and spoke directly to the microphone i am if youve quite finished spraying the room with testosterone the inspector glowered back at her when was the last time you saw your uncle he asked abruptly last june i took him a birthday present and took him out for lunch what you havent seen him since no i have not you didnt see him on or around saturday the eighteenth of november no i went to see him last saturday as you know quite well youre getting your dates mixed up no im not lady i meant the saturday before she shook her head i did not see my uncle on that date she said loudly and firmly we have information that you did then your informant is either mistaken or a liar the detectives face twisted into an ugly grin and when your uncle told a neighbour that afternoon that he was expecting a visit from his niece would he have been a liar too either he or the neighbour would certainly have been mistaken mackenzie glanced sideways at sergeant dell its amazing the number of times people say that to us gwennie isnt it it is sir ruth looked at her for a sign that she might be the soft cop in the old routine but found none theyre usually the ones that are lying though isnt that right it is indeed sir well this time she isnt inspector so when was the last time you spoke to your uncle a few weeks ago how did he sound old inspector he sounded old he was eighty and what did you say to him i promised him a visit soon but i wasnt specific about it i couldnt tell him any date for sure what kind of car do you drive mackenzie asked abruptly a corolla hatchback what colour is it blue so if a blue hatchback was seen outside your uncles house on the day he died the day he told his neighbour that he was expecting a visit from you that wouldnt have been yours then no it would not what do you earn miss mcconnell mind your own business tit is my business hen have you not worked that out yet no point in being coy anyway could find out by picking up a telephone okay my salary is around twentytwo thousand not bad eh reasonable i work for two of the most senior police officers in scotland on a confidential basis i have their trust she added pointedly mackenzie laughed again this time with undisguised mockery he reached across and switched off the tape once more and your man skinners never made a mistake about a woman has he i seem to remember he was all over the tabloids not so long ago something to do with him shagging a woman detective sergeant on his staff does he give you one as well now and again this is outrageous ruth spluttered listen bandit or whatever your damned name is unless you stop peddling innuendo and get specific about the purpose of this conversation im walking out of that door and i am going to see mr skinner and if that doesnt worry you then you are an even bigger fool than you are a playground bully the strathclyde inspector reached across and pressed the record button of the tape once again all right lets just jump to the detective sums up bit your old uncle john tells a neighbour on saturday the eighteenth of november in a state of some excitement that hes expecting a visit from his niece namely you because ive confirmed that youre the only niece he had later that afternoon just as it was getting dark a blue hatchback vehicle just like yours pulls up outside his door a tall darkhaired woman whose description you fit perfectly is seen to get out and walk straight into the house and right at that time someone sticks the old man in a scalding bath and drowns the poor old sod autographs in the rain she stared at him across the desk speechless truly shaken for the first time and theres more your uncle hadnt shown up at his golf club for a while so one of his cronies went to see him he found him concerned and confused as if the ageing process had caught up with him finally but he noticed that things were missing from the house there was a silver trophy he won at golf years back there was a very fine grandfather clock both missing when your uncles pal asked what had happened to them all he said was that his niece had money troubles then he told his old friend to bugger off and mind his own business mackenzie paused so you see miss mcconnell im engaged in a search for a cold cruel murderer and all the evidence i have points straight at you his only niece the sole beneficiary in his will yet when i ask a neighbouring force to do me a favour by picking you up and bringing you through for interview i get a call from some jumped up woman refusing and telling me to report to her i dont mind telling you that pisses me off and it doesnt make me inclined to go any easier on you than on any other suspect so if you werent drowning your uncle on november the eighteenth what the hell were you doing miss mcconnell i was with my boyfriend who is detective sergeant pye hes on the staff of detective chief superintendent martin the head of cid there you go dropping those names again is he the lad who brought you here the same guy who found your uncles body she nodded yes that was sammy do you live with him as of today yes i think i do but not then for the first time she sensed mackenzie becoming more cautious did you spend all day with him ruth took a deep breath and decided to tell the truth no i went round to his place in the morning we had a sandwich lunch watched television for a bit and then i went shopping in jenners and john lewis i left sammys at about two thirty and i got back just after six later we went out for a meal and a drink i see and can you prove you were in jenners or in john lewis do you have any credit card slips for example with your signature and the date and time no she admitted i didnt buy anything i didnt see anything i fancied at once all the hardness was back in the darkhaired detective as he turned to his sergeant once more i see piss poor cover story gwennie isnt it miss mcconnell even by your own account you had plenty of time to drive through to cumbernauld that afternoon do the old man then drive back to the lovenest in time for a nice evening out it was a really smart touch too going back the following saturday and arranging for the boy sammy to find the body miss i want to see your car i want to see any record you have of petrol purchases and i want to see all your bank accounts i expect that when ive done all that i will have more than enough evidence to justify a charge of murder in fact i could arrest you right now and take you back to cumbernauld but that would just be too much fucking hassle since your mans a ds ill trust him to be professional enough to ensure that you dont do anything silly and that next time when i send for you youre delivered giftwrapped this interview is terminated at five thirtyseven pm he switched off his tape you can go ill tell rose whats happening be available to us at any time tomorrow ruth picked up her bag looked down her nose at the two detectives then stood up from the table and left the room she was shaking as she walked up to pye who was waiting for her outside the building in accordance with skinners order he saw her agitation at once whats up love he demanded not here i cant tell you here i have to get out of this place right now sammy love please take me to mr skinner wherever he is i need to see him right now dan pringle looked around as he stepped out of his car it was eight thirty five on a late november morning and the sun had only just struggled above the eastern horizon yet as he breathed in the clean crisp morning air the burly detective superintendent felt a sudden strange burst of pleasure and relief to his great surprise he was discovering that with each passing day he liked the borders more and more when bob skinner and andy martin had invited him to move south following john mcgrigors decision to hand in his warrant card he had felt that it was no more than a step towards his own being put out to grass sure they had said all the right words they had explained that the borders division was a mature area which required maturity and experience of its senior police officers even especially perhaps those in the detective branch yet he had felt a niggling suspicion that he was simply being put out of the way a belated punishment for his scarcely disguised annoyance when the young head of cid had been appointed over his head now only a few days into the new job he realised that they had been right he took a sniff of the agricultural air and smiled no bullshit he whispered never before had his career taken him on to a farm of any description never before had he consciously mixed with countrymen a different sort entirely stolid straightforward undissembling men who looked you straight in the eye unimpressed by titles or authority he knew that no bright young lad or fasttracking young woman from the city could hope to step into a place like this particularly not to follow a massive son of the soil like mcgrigor who had carried an aweinspiring reputation from the rugby field into the senior ranks of cid more than that he knew that skinner and martin had done him a favour he thought back a year to a time when he and stevie steele had visited an office on the attic floor of a city centre building the breathlessness which had almost overwhelmed him at the end of the climb had been like a first intimation of mortality a quiet message gasped not whispered that he was a prime member of an at risk category he had tried since then to improve his physical condition however being in his fifties and as prone to a drink as the next polisman sometimes he had to admit being prone as a result of it he had found it difficult now translated with little warning from a city to a country copper he felt instantly the better for it as he trudged up the curving track towards the distant building looking at the rolling hills all around him he did not regret for a second his decision to come in his own road car rather than a force land rover he realised with astonishment that this morning walk was the most pleasurable thing he had done at work apart maybe from belting that russian for more years than he could remember he breathed deep and drank in the physical and psychological good that it was doing him as he neared the two squat stone cottages he saw two cars parked in front both offroaders he recognised one a blue suzuki jeep from his earlier visit but the other a massive toyota land cruiser was new to him its vivid green metallic finish seemed to shine through the mud which caked its sides as he looked at it a voice called out hey there what dae ye want a deep roughhewn voice that of a man given to asking only simple questions pringle fixed him with a policemans glare the man looked to be in his late fifties strong with a labourers build he held a black sack in his left hand and in the other a dead trout i want the manager the detective barked his answer as aggressive as the question the worker backed down over there sir he said at once as threatening as his trout thae cottages pringle was about to knock on the door of the first of the twin houses when it opened leaving him with his knuckles poised in midair descending towards nothing good morning superintendent said bill gates the young manager of the mellerkirk trout farm sorry about old harrys welcome hes a bit narked he thinks hes going to be laid off because of this gates was fairhaired slightly built inside his waxed cotton jacket a marks and spencer job pringle noticed rather than the more famous brand and wore a harassed expression come on into the office weve been watching you coming up the track he added that was a long walk you left yourself autographs in the rain a nice morning for it though mr gates the police officer stepped inside and looked around the first of the buildings which had once housed labourers of the land served as the office of the fish farm in the new era the other was still a dwelling occupied by the farm manager a single man on the other side of the room a door opened and a third man stepped through tall straightbacked silverhaired with a long patrician nose and small sharp blue eyes detective inspector pringle gates announced this is sir adrian watson baronet the owner of the farm and of the mellerkirk estate the newcomer offered no handshake nothing but a curt nod good day superintendent he barked youre the new fellow are you mcgrigors successor he looked pringle up and down as if he was inspecting livestock less of a stereotype than him i must say wish i could say the same for you the detective thought as he gazed back at the landowner big johns a good man to follow sir he ran a tight ship down here in that case youre not living up to it very well are you man it seemed to dan pringle as if all the good of his morning walk had been undone in an instant as he felt his blood pressure soar would you like to expand on that sir adrian he asked coldly i may expand on it to sir james proud the next time i see him in the new club you do that very thing sir but right here right now id like you to explain to me what you meant by that remark the baronet looked at the policeman taken aback slightly by his bristling aggression we you bastard pringle thought havent gone completely native not yet anyway where are my damn fish then the estate owner snapped trying to bluster his way out of what had become suddenly an uncomfortable corner you dont look as if youve come to tell me youve caught these damn thieves no i havent well what are you doing here go away and get on with it man listen sir adrian said the detective its time you came to terms with the facts fact one ive got officers all over scotland and beyond involved in the search for your stock were checking every possible processing centre we can find were checking every supermarket chain in the country to see if theyve been offered any surprise consignments of trout were interviewing every resident in this area to see if anyone saw a large vehicle enter or leave your farm on the night of the theft you know what theyre all wasting their fucking time fact two weve got little or no chance of recovering your fish by now theyre probably killed and frozen down and in a store that weve got no chance of finding in a few months time theyll start showing up in the sort of street corner minimarket where you have to check the sellby date on every can of beer the sort of place where the owner wont ask questions if hes offered some bargain stock either that or theyll be disposed of in bulk through a cashandcarry somewhere down south or possibly in france or spain but suppose we do catch some joker trying to flog some frozen trout hes going to spin us a story about having netted them what are we going to do then stick the fucking things in a lineup and ask you and mr gates to identify them he glared at watson fact three you are not only the victim here sir you are also a contributory factor to the crime youre running a business here with a multimillionpound turnover youve got a massive investment in stock in rearing tanks in sterile conditions for harvesting handling killing and distribution yet you grudged the relatively small investment it would have taken to protect you against the possibility of a theft like this fact four john mcgrigor visited you personally a couple of years ago and another time before that and he advised you to install perimeter alarms linked to the nearest fully manned police office plus a video system with cameras on inaccessible steel poles linked to a recorder offsite the cost of all that would have been a relatively small addition to your total capital investment here you could have written it off against tax in the usual way and reduced your insurance premiums significantly did you do that did you fuck you told him that the fact that the manager lived on site was security enough you were dead bloody wrong of course and thats why the three of us are standing here today pringle turned towards the door thats what i came here to tell you this morning those fish have bolted now of course but its not too late to bar the gate against a repeat performance he grasped the round brass handle then paused and took a deep breath oh aye theres one more thing autographs in the rain fact five if you ever try to threaten me again or try to dismiss me in that way then do not from that time on drink as much as a thimbleful of whisky and get into your car or park on a yellow line or give a sweetie to a kid in the street or do anything else you could be had up for or believe me you will be if you want to tell all that to sir james proud in the new club in his office or anywhere fucking else be my guest but tip me off when youre going to do it because id like to be there the heavy door crashed shut behind the detective as he began the long walk back to his car down the rough track feeling the recuperative power of the morning country air there was a broad smile on his face ruth mcconnell made a soft sound as pye pulled his car into his space in the park behind police headquarters directly alongside a sleek red mgf sports car whats up sammy asked i was just thinking about your bosss pride and joy parked next to us thatll be going down the road soon karen wont be able to get into it in a couple of months and once she has the baby dont you believe it andy martin and that motor are joined at the hip but its not a problem theyve got another car a new ford focus they got it after they sold karens flat anyhow just for a minute there i thought you were pissed off at me or something she reached out and touched his cheek and why would i sammy you were really great last night really understanding i was just so stressed out that if we had it would have been awful disastrous even having you there beside me i really needed you but i have never been less in the mood he glanced at her mournfully ive never been more in the mood she laughed again brightly i could see that very impressive even under cover she laid her hand on his thigh once the boss gets back im sure all the strain will be off but until it is until i know for sure im still in this nightmare once it is over would you like to move in with me or would you like me to move in with you or do you prefer it the way it is he sighed and smiled you know what i want your place is bigger than mine your bathrooms nicer your kitchens better equipped ill move in with you after a while we can look for something together i wont be in this job forever who knows mr martin might post me down to the borders beside dan pringle no danger jack mcgurks there already remember youre going back autographs in the rain east eventually to brian mackies division stevie steeles going to team up with maggie rose again once a certain ds in her team retires how do you know all that i just do now please forget i said it well have to be careful with the pillowtalk you and i im just looking forward to starting it the too said ruth but now wed better get inside my big boss might be away for the morning but the other ones probably been in for an hour already detective inspector david mackenzie stepped into his office closed the door behind him then stared in astonishment at the man sitting behind his desk his mouth hung open as the visitor pushed himself out of his chair and walked round toward him the blow was faster than anything he had ever seen the tips of three stiff straight fingers stabbed into the pit of his stomach at the top of the inverted vshape below his ribcage a bolt of pain worse than anything he had ever known flooded through him and stayed his legs gave and his bladder almost followed but despite the agony he managed to keep it under control as he started to fall the man caught him by the lapels of his overcoat held him up then dropped him on to a straightbacked seat mackenzie wanted to shout for help but he felt as if he had no breath left in his lungs only fire also he guessed that there was a fair chance that if he tried no sound would be allowed to escape his lips who he croaked eventually you know who i am said the intruder icily you know all about me bandit or so it seems he reached into his pocket produced a small palmsized tape recorder and pressed a button the inspector froze as he heard his own voice tinny but unmistakable and your man skinners never made a mistake about a woman has he i seem to remember he was all over the tabloids not so long ago something to do with him shagging a woman detective sergeant on his staff does he give you one as well now and again the answer is no mackenzie although the man who does is a lucky sonofabitch mister youve just committed two of the biggest mistakes any detective officer can make the first is stupidity and the second is underestimating a suspect ive been guilty of both myself in my time but never as crassly as autographs in the rain that ruth works for me shes a very intelligent lady and shes picked up a few touches from me in her time for the purposes of your investigation ill tell you this you arrogant young bastard last night after your failed attempt at intimidation ruth came straight to see me she played me that tape which sealed your fate on the spot then i asked her to think very carefully about all the time she spent away from sammy that saturday afternoon happily she remembered something she remembered seeing my daughter in jenners just before five oclock she didnt speak to her but she saw her on the other side of the secondfloor balcony in the glassware department i called alex and she confirmed that she was there and she does have a date and time stamped credit card slip to prove it for halfadozen whisky tumblers as it happens my christmas present shes pissed off because now shell have to get me something else so you can forget about ruthie as a suspect that was always far too fucking easy anyway ill grant you that all the circumstances pointed straight at her but even at that you must have been out of your fucking mind to think that a dccs secretary would off anyone and let herself be seen doing it so look somewhere else bandit your investigations back to square one again understood mackenzie nodded still incapable of coherent speech still racked with pain you know son bob skinner continued therere two ways a copper like you can go he can go to the top or he can go to hell in a handcart make me your enemy and you are on route two you can be dead certain of that he held up the recorder for the strathclyde detective to see i could use this tape to have you sent to oban in a uniform by tomorrow morning at the latest ive got the power to halt your career in its tracks but im not going to because i asked my pal willie haggerty about you you remember him yes i thought you would he told me that youre undoubtedly the cockiest most conceited bastard hes ever met and that you have been in need of a really good doing for some time but he said also that youve made di in spite of your weaknesses and that with them knocked out of you you could become a great detective officer now youve got the chance to prove him right get out there and find out who killed old john mcconnell and keep me informed of progress every step of the way dont worry about jurisdiction ill square that with your gaffers they owe me a couple of favours and ive got a personal interest in this one he looked down through what david bandit mackenzie realised were the coldest blue eyes he had ever seen im backing willie haggertys judgement of you son you prove us wrong and i might just come back here and teach you everything i know about intimidation as the door of his office swung open ted chase sighed his irritation inspector good he began i thought i told you to call before then he looked up and saw a figure clad in a uniform which was heavy with silver braid he stood up straight behind his desk almost by reflex im sorry chief i didnt realise not at all not at all said sir james proud i should apologise i ought to have knocked he waved some correspondence which he was holding i just thought bob might have been in here that was all theres something i wanted to ask him about it wouldnt be the london incident would it chase ventured as a matter of fact it would how the hell did you know about that the normally affable chief constable frowned slightly i happened to be in the office on sunday when the document arrived since it was marked urgent i took it upon myself to open it in your absence i took it upon myself also to show it to the dcc and to discuss it with him did you not think you were taking rather a lot on yourself ted asked sir james youve only been here ten minutes and five of them must have been taken up writing that paper of yours on the command structure of the force i exercised my judgement sir thats all i can say even though for all you knew this could have been a report from the security services exposing you as an iraqi spy all the more reason for me to open it sir proud jimmy laughed aye maybe so anyway ted youve explained everything i get this daft report about bob which youve already showed to him in the same intray i find this grovelling apology from the bloke who wrote it you dont have to tell me what happened when bob read the bloody nonsense even assistant commissioners arent beyond his reach yes chase concurred he does seem to have his own powerbase doesnt he the silverhaired chief constable looked at his assistant for a few seconds maybe you didnt mean that remark to have a barb in it ted if you did please desist i have your paper under consideration and i am taking it seriously im seized of your underlying point that criminal investigation is only one of the responsibilities of a modern police force and should not be allowed to dominate it so incidentally is bob skinner he and i have discussed that very concept on many occasions however i and i alone will decide what happens to your document and ill do it in my own good time so just leave it at that eh very good sir but i really didnt mean anything by my last remark good then forgive me for reading anything into it sir james paused want a coffee chase took the invitation as an order he nodded and followed the chief back to his own office do you happen to know where bob is anyway ted proud jimmy glanced across the table as gerry crossley set a coffee pot and crockery on his low table not really sir i asked miss mcconnell but she said simply that he had an appointment out of the office mmm i asked her too she said all she knew was that he had to see someone through in strathclyde thats funny im not saying its unique but its unusual for ruth not to know exactly what hes doing unless she does and for some reason shes not telling he smiled almost to himself if she does well sometimes its best not to know what that buggers up to if god had meant people to play golf in this valley he wouldnt have put the prevailing wind in this direction it can be as cold as charity here in the middle of summer have you played dullatur sir mackenzie asked no but i have played the course across the road westerwood middle of june it was and fucking freezing this one wont be any different the west of scotland new towns east kilbride and cumbernauld were established on land within easy reach of glasgow but where no major community had grown up before the planner should have realised that that was no accident eks always snowed up in the winter and cumbernaulds swept by this bloody arctic wind you sound as if youre from the west sir motherwell i dug an escape tunnel twentyfive years ago would you ever come back bob skinner shook his head not to live he said vehemently t like gullane and my family are happy there but crime tends to move around ill go wherever it takes me im a specialist policeman bandit just like you my chief constable and i have long philosophical discussions about that his strengths complement mine he couldnt run todays force without me or another specialist like me and i couldnt run one without someone like him aye but how does that help the punters sir the younger man interposed showing a renewed trace of his customary brashness red tapes always fucking up our job skinner looked sideways at him see there is a brain hiding behind that designer raincoat of yours thats a bloody good question should we have separate bodies one responsible for public protection and the maintenance of order and the other charged with criminal investigation if i was a politician which thank god i am not because i distrust the bastards totally i would answer yes and do something about it however they do tell me that i can move and shake things so you never know mackenzie picked up a bacon roll from the table before them til watch developments sir he took a bite why did you want me to bring you here he asked several reasons i missed my breakfast to come through and sort you out so you owe me one old john mcconnell was a member here so i wanted to get a feel for the place as it turns out youre a member too so that was handy on top of all that i wanted to get you out of that office to see if i could kickstart your thinking on this investigation lafter all ive just blown your easy assumption right out the window so maybe i owe you one he looked around the members lounge impressive place this is david for an ordinary urban golf club if you dont mind me saying so mackenzie nodded agreement too right he pointed to his right out across the first tee where two golfers stood in weathersuits ready to set off into the wind and rain the original clubhouse was away down there the new town development corporation before it was wound up did a complicated land deal with us which involved them building this place for us plus laying out some new holes as well good deal aye sir everybody won id say as he spoke a door behind him opened an elderly man in casual clothing walked into the room holding a cup of coffee morning he said nodding towards the players outside rather them than us the day eh gents too right skinner agreed you wouldnt get me out on a morning like this ye dont look as if yere here to play anyway though the old man observed no were not although my colleague heres a member actually were police officers we were just talking about poor old john mcconnell the veteran grimaced aye damn shame that poor old john hell be missed him such a fit man too tae go downhill so fast how dyou mean mackenzie asked well he jist did he used tae play every day yed have found him out the day even then about four months ago he started missing days until he wisnae here at all ah heard fae somebody that went tae see him that he was jist sitting there in his hoose fair wandered that alzheimers eh its jist as well hes awa quick autographs in the rain yes i suppose it is skinner murmured waving a brief farewell to the senior member as he wandered across to a table on the far side of the big lounge interesting he said his voice still low i envy you this one bandit its a real challenge too right but where do i start come on man you start at the beginning who knows so far apart from us that this is a murder investigation no bugger does well its time they did call in the press tell them that youre starting a fullscale investigation recanvass the neighbours while their memories are still reasonably fresh the darkhaired woman you know who she isnt so get a better description of her to help you find out who she is try to establish what make and model of car she was driving then there are the missing possessions grandfather clock big silver trophy theyll be somewhere find them after youve apologised profusely to ruth he leaned on the adverb ask her to go through the house to see what else might be missing if that doesnt help look at the whole scene in a mirror look into his bank accounts to see what was happening there mackenzie frowned i know that already sir fine in that case go back to everyone who spoke to old john before his death turn up people you havent even looked for yet did he have any interests other than golf find out what was happening to him i will bet you one thing detective inspector mackenzie even suppose that was a district nurse who went into his house that saturday that old boy didnt have alzheimers hes been a victim of something all right but it was man or womanmade utographs in the rain sir adrian watson sure ill remember that name dan and yes ill pass itpn to the chief and the dcc too just in case thanks andy not that anything happened that i couldnt justify to myself but threatening to nail him to the fucking wall might look bad if he wrote to the scotsman or got his tame lib dem msp to raise a question in the scottish parliament id be surprised if he did but what about this chap gates how would he swing if watson did get stroppy gates told me the first time i met him that he recommended that watson should follow john mcgrigors advice and install an automatic security system but he was advised bluntly to wind his neck in i could tell that inside the boy was cheering when i gave sir adrian the benefit of my own advice nonetheless hes an employee and he did hear me threaten watson presumably he also heard watson threaten you aye but he might forget though look im no that worried about it andy im just telling you in case there was any comeback that might cause embarrassment i appreciate that dan leave it with me ill deal with it cheers andy martin ended the call then buzzed his junior assistant detective constable rhind lorna he said i want you to trace a number for sir adrian watson hes a landowner down in the borders get him on the line for me please he turned to detective sergeant pye who was seated across the desk waiting sorry about all that sam you probably gathered dan pringles had his first runin with the local establishment down on his patch pye grunted and hes been there for a week already im surprised it took him so long sir the head of cid laughed the too but it proves us right in sending him adown there nothing against big john but the division needed shaking up a bit needed his successor to be a different sort we could have sent brian mackie down there and the place would have fitted him like a glove but the dcc and i reckoned that dans occasional lack of diplomacy made him best suited for it oh i get it sir he does the plain speaking with you in the background to smooth over any incidents the phone rang yes as youre about to hear he picked it up sir adrian good detective chief superintendent andy martin head of cid i thought id give you a call pye across the desk saw his boss pause and nod yes superintendent pringles told me about your discussion yes sure dans a plainspoken man sir and hes spent most of his career in the city but theres no better or more committed detective officer on this force im glad you appreciate that sir im sure youll appreciate also that he didnt intend to threaten you any more i doubt not than you meant to give the impression that you were threatening him or were dismissive of his efforts and those of his officers no of course not we have a simple operating principle in dealing with the public equality for all under the law every lawabiding citizen can expect the same treatment from us sir and no individual is subjected to inappropriate scrutiny unless he or she is suspected of committing a crime or offence or unless we have reason to believe they may be about to commit one why should i believe otherwise sir i played rugby in the borders many times in my career ive been in many a club bar after many a match i may even have seen you once or twice and i cant recall ever seeing anyone have an excessive amount to drink and get into a car pye searched martins face for any sign of sarcasm but found only bland innocence sure sir adrian a slight excess of zeal yes of course ill convey your apologies to dan also im glad you see it that way and im pleased that youre so supportive of the work were doing to trace these thieves and good afternoon to you too sir he replaced the receiver there you are sam he said smoothed over and i never told a single porky either what what about never seeing anyone in a rugby club get into a car over the limit martin grinned i never looked anyway although i didnt play for all that long after i joined the force word gets round if theres a copper in the bar i do remember watson by the way he was pointed out to me at a club once real arsehole and he was pissed as a rat he swung round in his chair to face pye so sergeant whys your face been tripping you all morning as if i had to ask you know of course i bloody know superintendent rose called me as soon as mackenzie and dell had left last night she told me what had happened then about an hourandahalf later after you and ruth had been to see the big man he phoned me absolutely fucking incandescent with anger what was on that tape ruth played him he wouldnt tell me the young detective winced then dont ask me to tell you either sir that bad eh it could be goodbye mr mackenzie then because the said di had a surprise early morning visit from dcc skinner cleared in advance with max albright the strathclyde head of cid i phoned him this morning just in case another diplomatic mission was necessary max said that big bob called him at home last night i knew he was going to and asked formal permission to jump on mackenzies toes from a great height he told me he said to go ahead please because the blokes been in need of it for a while only he couldnt find an excuse martin leaned back in his chair and grinned at pye then just before dans conscience call from the borders the dcc phoned me from his car on his way back through here ruths off the hook sam with a grovel from the bandit as well he said we should listen to the news any time after midday he checked his watch its close on twelve thirty now he reached back to a small table to switch on a small sorry radio before he could do so his office door opened unexpectedly and a tall beautiful woman in full bloom stepped into the room hello karen pye exclaimed jumping to his feet and pulling a chair from the wall up to the desk for gods sake sammy karen martin laughed im not that pregnant she turned towards her husband hope you dont mind me being early for lunch but shopping for a lump dress took less time than i thought andy grinned back miracle of miracles no thats fine but hold on for autographs in the rain a minute okay theres something we want to hear he pushed the radios on button they had to wait for only a minute before the bulletin began the second item was a report of a midday press conference held in glasgow by strathclyde police to announce that a fullscale murder investigation was under way into the death of mr john mcconnell of cumbernauld it included a short soundbite from detective inspector david mackenzie appealing to the public for information about mr mcconnells last days and in particular for any sightings of a tall darkhaired woman and a blue car seen outside his house on the afternoon when he was believed to have died well there you are murmured martin switching off the sorry as his exdetective wife looked at him with her former professional curiosity aroused the wrath of god hath fallen upon the woeful bandit who repenteth plenty where do we start though sir asked gwendoline dell now that your fii t principle of detections been stood on its head never look further than the obvious without good reason how do we actually progress this investigation dont chance your arm gwennie mackenzie growled were going to do the things that the uniformed numpties who handled the thing until the postmortem report came in never bothered to do for a start no ones even talked to mr mcconnells gp we dont know anything about the old mans medical history all we have is assumption and hearsay for all we know the mystery woman in the blue car could have been a doctor the old boy might have been under treatment for something that didnt show up in the pm we should go back to the people weve interviewed so far see if we can get them to be more specific about the things they told us for example not that were going to get it a registration number for that motor would be more than useful you get your wheels turning on that instead of sitting there laughing to yourself about me getting turned over as if i would sir the blonde sergeant chided with the very faintest of smiles gaun bugger off mackenzie laughed theres something else ive got to do and youre not sitting in on that seeing a grown man crawl can be an awful experience he waited until the door closed behind dell and he heard her footsteps recede down the corridor before picking up the phone on his desk and dialling a number which bob skinner had left him bob skinner mackenzie felt a cold pang at the memory still fresh of his introduction to the man he knew within himself that it would stay fresh always what a mixture cold and terrifying one minute then message transmitted received and understood affable positive and helpful the next autographs in the rain he had heard stories about the edinburgh dcc his old boss willie haggerty spoke of him often but nothing had prepared him for the reality or warned him of the extent of the folly of crossing him he made the call and heard two rings at the other end of the line before the woman answered ms mcconnell he began doing his best not to sound ingratiating this is an apologetic david mackenzie from cumbernauld ive been told that its up to me whether i accept your apology or not inspector she said coldly but its been suggested that i should and so i will what can i do for you you could come through here if youd be good enough and meet me at your uncles house i promise well let you in this time please if it would make you feel easier bring someone with you ds pye maybe sammys my boyfriend mr mackenzie not my minder anyway i dont imagine ill need company do you im sure youll be as considerate today as you were inconsiderate yesterday bearing in mind that the last time i was in that house my uncle was lying dead in the bath til need to clear it with both my bosses but assuming that its all right ill meet you there at four oclock the ruth business is all sorted out then boss detective inspector neil mcjlhenney asked rhetorically what sort of a superhero does that guy mackenzie think he is waltzing on to our patch and giving one of us as ruthie is the third degree ach said skinner we can all get a bit carried away with ourselves from time to time the boy bandit got carried too far away thats all hes a good copper when you strip the bullshit away you sound as if you wish he was working for you he is working for me im taking a personal interest in this investigation apart from bloody terrifying ruth last night they owe it to her to find out what happened to her uncle fucking weird neil i tell you a fit old man till last summer still with two good hips and playing singlefigure golf going into his eighties shooting well under his age practically every time he set foot on the course then a few months later he just drowned in his bath mackenzies promised to copy me all the reports coming out of his investigation meantime theres something id like you to do for me get on to the pathologist in glasgow who did the pm on the old boy and ask him to fax or email me his complete report photos and all i think ill show it to sarah to see if anything occurs to her i suppose youd better tell him that too i dont want to ruffle any professional plumage mcllhenney nodded will do boss ive got something for you though ive just had a call from that lad from the met the one who called me at the weekend he told me that one of their uniformed women was on foot patrol in regent street early this morning when she spotted something in the gutter about two hundred yards away from the spot where you had your bother it was bent out of shape and looked as if it had been run over by a car but it turned out to be a spent shotgun cartridge is that right the dccs eyes shone in triumph id like to shove it up autographs in the rain assistant commissioner dumptys arse he muttered just to teach him not to doubt the word of a brother officer he paused still smiling oh aye thinking about regent street and all reminds me lou bankiers coming up to scotland on friday and ive invited her to dinner at gullane i was going to ask alex to join us and to take her back to the balmoral afterwards but it turns out shes going to paris on business he caught the twitch of mcllhenneys eyebrows i know bloody lawyers move in a different world these days anyway if you can find a childsitter sarah and i wondered if youd like to join us you can do the taxi run of course which wont be a problem since you insist on being teetotal these days the big inspector looked at him oddly its nice of the two of you to ask boss but i dont know the truth is i havent sat down to dinner with any adult other than you and sarah since olive died i dont know what kind of company id be i do or i wouldnt have asked you ill tell you from the perspective of one whos made such a mistake you cant be a social hermit all your life man furthermore you know damn well that your wife would have been the very first to agree with me anyway for gods sake im offering you a date with a movie star mcllhenney grinned now that would give olive a laugh he glanced upwards for a second aye all right boss she says its okay thanks thats good now go and get me that pm report and lets see what i can stir up there was only one car parked in the street when ruth turned into qlenlaverock grove it was a bright red ford ka with colourmatched plastic bumpers and it stood directly outside number fifteen she pulled up her blue corolla close behind it as she did so bandit mackenzie climbed out of the drivers seat almost catching his long overcoat in the door as he closed it behind him the coat suits you inspector she said a shade archly it goes with your image the car doesnt though of course if you were wearing a pointy blue hat with a bell on the end its not mine honest he assured her hurriedly mines in for a service this is the wifes my god you have a wife aye and three kids indeed and what do you do if one of them comes home with a bad school report shine hot lights in his eyes and give him the third degree mackenzie smiled at her the hostility of the day before had vanished if she had never met him before she might have taken a liking to him at first sight my kids dont get bad reports he said other than my fouryear old when he tried to correct a playgroup teachers spelling i wonder where he got that trait from ah but he was right he must take after his mother then the inspector sighed ill tell you what ms connell i know this is a smokeless zone but if you can come up with some ashes i think i could lay my hands on the sackcloth i am really sorry about yesterday all our information did point to you and i got pissed off at having to traipse through to edinburgh but still i went over the top i must have scared the hell out of you a big mistake on my part i tell you autographs in the rain finally she smiled back at him with a degree of satisfaction you dont ha veto she paused very well inspector apology accepted lets start off fresh lets go inside its chilly out here mackenzie nodded then reached into his overcoat pocket and produced a labelled key ring here he said handing them to her you can have these back our forensic team are all finished here ill keep the second set for a while if you dont mind just in case gwennie and i need to go back to check up on something such as i have no idea at this moment but you can never tell it would be useful thats all okay if you have to she looked at the keys and found the two which opened the front door as the detective ripped away the plastic crimescene tape the house was cold as they stepped inside ruth looked at a wall thermometer in the hall with a circular switch alongside this controls the central heating she said its set at five centigrade one of your people must have turned it back no replied mackenzie it was like that when we were called out she frowned yes she murmured i remember now it was cold when sammy and i came in at first id forgotten that was unusual i always remember uncle johns house as being uncomfortably hot the inspector stepped up to the control wheel and peered at it there you are right away thats something well need to come back for this doesnt look as if our technicians have dusted it we must though just in case our darkhaired lady found it uncomfortably hot as well he turned back to ruth where do you want to begin what about the garage what about it he didnt drive much mr mackenzie but he still had a car a big old rover coupe with real leather seats hes had it all my life so it must be over thirty years old it was his pride and joy he used to spend hours cleaning and polishing it ive been in the garage ms mcconnell said the detective quietly theres no car there a back wall racked with carefully arranged tools but no car for a few moments ruth had to fight to hold back tears oh no she whispered the grandfather clock the trophy okay theyre gone but something very bad must have been happening for uncle john to sell his car maybe he didnt sell it maybe someone just took it but who why i dont know but presumably the same people whove been emptying his deposit account in the hibernian building society in coatbridge over the last few months what i mackenzie nodded tm afraid so how much did you know about your uncles finances only that he was comfortably off nothing much else mmm he had two bank accounts a current account with the bank of scotland that his pension was paid into and the other one with the hibernian last summer that had over seventy grand in it just under three weeks ago the last of the money was drawn out each of the withdrawals was made by a third party on the basis of a form signed by the old man nominating ms ruth mcconnell as his representative the tellers who handled the transactions all described a tall attractive woman with long dark hair didnt they ask for evidence of identity they did she showed them a credit card with your name on it he looked at her so you see ruth on the basis of all that plus what the old man said to his friend about you having money troubles maybe you can understand a bit better why i was so bloody sure of myself yesterday she bit her lip unconsciously yes she conceded ill give you that can you remember the cars registration number yes cdv she laughed quietly taking the policeman by surprise i remember uncle john telling me about ten years ago that a man called charles de were offered him five thousand pounds for it for the plate alone that is without the car that looks like another asset stripped out then mind you maybe this woman will surprise me by being really stupid and offering the number for sale in exchange and mart do you expect her to not for one second come on he said briskly lets see what else if anything shes got away with autographs in the rain ruth nodded and followed him into the living room what about his watch she asked there was one watch among his effects a cheap battery thing there wasnt a rolex no absolutely not id have remembered there should have been my aunt gave it to him on their fortieth wedding anniversary she retired about a month before that she was the matron of a hospital in stirling she bought it out of her lump sum she pointed to a wall cupboard near the fireplace it was split into two halves and the upper section had a glass door there was a silver tea service in there my aunts what about her jewellery my mother and i were left a couple of pieces but uncle john kept her diamond engagement ring and a sapphire and diamond ring that had been my aunts mothers that in particular was worth a lot of money theyve gone too then what can you tell me about the grandfather clock he asked not a lot im no expert i can tell you that it was a big one though with a shiny brass face that uncle john always kept polished it always kept good time as well he knew a watchmaker who serviced it for him she dropped to one knee and swung open the doors of a big sideboard bastards she hissed in anger theres nothing in here either there should have been an eightpiece wedgwood dinner service and a canteen of sheffield steel cutlery inspector she said as she stood up once more there doesnt seem to be anything of value left in this house its been picked clean i dont know who this woman was but shes a vulture no ruth said mackenzie slowly shes worse than that vultures are carrion birds this creature does her own killing detective sergeant gwendoline dell had sore feet she had spent the afternoon on fruitless visits one had been to john mcconnells doctor who had declared that on his last visit for a prebirthday checkup the old man had been the fittest eighty yearold he had ever seen strong as a horse he was all that golf over all those years gave him forearms like a blacksmith another call had been to his club cronies gathered in the bar sheltering from the awful day one of them had directed her to a railwaymans club in the nearby village of croy but the steward there had never heard of the old man finally she had canvassed every house in the streets around his home trudging from door to door ringing bell after bell most of them without reply those people who were in were either wrapped up in afternoon television or struggling with preschool children they were all concerned citizens every one of them frowned sympathetically as they denied even knowing john mcconnell far less being familiar with his visitors and his habits she had kept the unlikeliest prospect for last miss alice find retired schoolteacher of number twelve glenlaverock grove unlikely because it was she who had reported seeing the tall dark woman heading towards her neighbours door on the last day of his life more than that she had given impetus to the wild goose chase by suggesting that it might have been his niece come away in dear said miss find in an accent which suggested a genteel glasgow upbringing you poor soul she clucked you look absolutely worn out let me make you a cup of tea normally gwendoline would have declined but the old lady was right she was worn out and dry as a bone and there was another reason to accept she guessed that the blue corolla parked behind lorraine mackenzies noddycar belonged to ruth mcconnell and she autographs in the rain had no wish to bump into her again she looked around the neat living room as her hostess rattled crockery in the kitchen it was of another age it felt just like visiting her granny miss linds return broke into her thoughts she took the proffered cup of tea gratefully and even accepted a tunnocks caramel wafer i heard the news at lunchtime the former teacher said poor mr mcconnell how very awful no wonder your people spent so long at the house she paused then added casually was his niece of any help to you shes helping us right now ds dell volunteered but im sorry to tell you that wasnt her you saw ten days ago the old lady looked genuinely surprised oh was it not i dont know the girl of course but ive seen her on the odd occasion shes been to see her uncle and from the back it did look very like her ah so you only saw her from the back well yes i suppose i did it was the hair though the girl ruths is long and wellgroomed like those lassies in the shampoo ads and this other ones was just the same i was absolutely sure too i hope i havent caused ruth any upset none at all gwendoline lied no i was just wondering miss find if you could remember any more about this woman her car for example can you recall what make it was my dear i cant tell one car from another i grew up in a time when there were shooting brakes and running boards and things like that today theyre all the same not like that lovely rover of mr mcconnells now that is what i call a car the womans id enough trouble remembering that it was green green but you said before that it was blue did i well maybe thats what i thought at the time when you get to my age my dear the memory goes funny the detective moaned inwardly do you have any idea how long the car was there she asked not really dear the old teacher replied i dont think it was there when i closed my curtains at six oclock but it was dark by then so i cant really be sure what about the woman herself think back please miss find can you remember what she was wearing a long coat and boots that i can remember they made her legs even longer anything else anything at all the old lady pursed her lips and put a hand to her head as if she was rummaging about in it well there was her bag i suppose her handbag no dear not a handbag more of a shoulderbag only it was bigger than that a big square thing almost the size of a suitcase yes i remember thinking that from the size of the thing ruth must have come for the weekend should i be doing this dr sarah grace skinner asked as she took the folder from her husband by that i mean have you cleared it with she opened the folder and peered at the top sheet dr mccallum of course i have her husband replied neil spoke to her she told him that she was more than happy to have someone else look over the papers the impression he got was that she feels a bit exposed now that all the background circumstances have come out i dont blame her okay drowning in the bath is not an everyday cause of death among adults but this man was eighty years old in this case the pathologists natural instinct would not be to ring alarm bells maybe not said bob thoughtfully but maybe it should have been she grinned at him as she laid the folder on the kitchen work surface i will read this later once the kids are in bed she handed him a china bowl with beatrix potter rabbits around the edge meantime take this and feed your younger daughter he took the dish and pulled up a chair beside the high seat in which seonaid the newest member of clan skinner bounced up and down in anticipation she was a sparkling sturdy baby and a fast developer like her brother james andrew had been in his infant days before he grew into a rough and ready threeyearold okay junior miss her father murmured spooning up some of the blended food what the hells this gunge ive been asked to give you beef and vegetable sarah called across her accent was still upstate new york for all her years in scotland and before you knock it it aint out of no jar i made that myself its not unlike what the rest of us are going to have once youve put tootsie to bed ive just mashed it down with the hand blender thats all whatever it was the baby demolished it with impressive concentration as her mother headed upstairs to round up jazz and their adopted son mark who were along the corridor in their playroom engrossed in deep space nine bob skinner was an enthusiastic parent he had been left to bring up alex alone for most of her young life he reckoned that he had done a pretty fair job but it gave him a secret inner delight that he had been given a second opportunity to share the experience with someone else he made a point whenever the job permitted of being home early enough in the evening to be able to feed seonaid bath her and put her to bed then to spend time with the boys before their curfew i that evening was typical of the domestic regime which he and sarah had established they were both pleasurably tired by pm when mark and jazz went upstairs for the night okay said sarah at last as she slumped down on to the sofa in their living room lets see that report obediently bob walked back through to the kitchen and brought the folder to her making herself comfortable in her seat she opened it counted the pages briefly then turned to the colour photographs which were appended to them did you get these by email too she asked yes they were sent through as files i had our it people print them out as clean as they could very impressive if only they could email autopsy subjects to me id never have to leave gullane bob scratched his stubbly chin if we had the garage converted to a mortuary i could arrange to have them brought to you i doubt if the boys would fancy mum nipping out twice a day to carve up a cadaver you kidding theyd love it wed be the talk of the village though ive got news for you kid were that already she smiled then turned her full attention to the photographs this was taken in situ she asked looking at the first theres an index at the back but yes it was it was shot as soon as theyd drained the water from the bath i wish they had taken one before they did that why see those patches discolouring the white enamel she pointed to marks on the photograph they could be strips of skin what would that tell you nothing for sure but she hesitated frowning suppose the old man was suffering from rapidly developing dementia if in his confused autographs in the rain state he ran himself a bath straight from the hot tap then climbed in in his senile condition the scalding effect could have induced shock causing him to faint and slip below the surface absorbing a lungful of water which would have killed him immediately the body would have blistered causing those strips of skin to detach themselves post mortem if i were you he held up a hand not me detective inspector bandit mackenzie strathclyde cid bandit aye the lad believes in his own legend just a bit too much hes proud of his nickname well in that case if i was bandit id go back to the house and see if theres anything still clinging to the inside of that bath what might that tell him that this isnt a homicide at all on the basis of this photograph alone the strathclyde police have been precipitate here their investigation is based purely on this woman who looks like ruth being seen going into the house on the day mr mcconnell probably died probably interjected bob yes probably im sure the estimate of time of death was scientifically based but theres always a margin for error stop right here find the mystery woman charge her and ill give evidence for the defence she walks in ten minutes the crown office wouldnt let it anywhere near court i see yet my gut feeling is that mackenzies right read on and lets see if we can help him prove it he pointed to the photograph whys the body in that condition thats called saponification it can be caused by burying a body in very damp conditions or in this case immersing it in water essentially it means that the corpse is turned or largely turned into something akin to soap that might have helped dr mccallum establish time of death but it could have given her other problems for example the process might have destroyed major organs lets find out sarah turned back to the narrative of the emailed report and began to read as she did so bob went into the kitchen took two bottles of sol from the fridge uncapped them and carried them back to the lounge thanks said his wife without looking up as she took one from him she finished the beer before she finished her study she thanked him again as he gave her another and as she laid down the report weird she pronounced theres no evidence of cerebral degeneration at all dr mccallum notes that the brain is the healthiest shed ever seen in an eightyyearold man this doesnt preclude mental illness of course or severe depression yet think of one of the senior section of our own golf club you know the people i mean there are plenty of them in their late seventies or into their eighties playing every day and looking ten sometimes fifteen years younger jthan they really are imagine if one of them suddenly withdrew from the world for no obvious reason and degenerated physically over a period of weeks to the point of pouring himself a scalding bath by mistake and dying in it you cant can you only with difficulty bob admitted well from what youve told me and from what ive read that seems to be what happened here dr mccallum reports some degeneration of vital organs but she was able to record that they were all in excellent condition analysis of the liver showed that mr mcconnell had never been an excessive drinker his kidneys were almost donor class the alimentary system was clear the muscles particularly those of the arms and legs appeared to be wasted but there was sufficient bulk to indicate that this process had begun recently there was clear evidence of cardiac seizure but this is consistent with my supposition that the old man might have been immersed in a scalding bath it might have rendered him unconscious but it didnt kill him he drowned all right so are you saying that mackenzie should scale down his investigation even though the whole thing screams suspicious death at both of us she smiled at him one of those specials which as he knew so well always preceded a metaphorical rabbit appearing from an imaginary top hat i would save for one thing analysis showed bloodstream traces of temazepam significant traces id say given the mans age and rapidly deteriorating physical condition you told me earlier that mr mcconnell hadnt been under any form of medical supervision or treatment thats mackenzies information autographs in the rain okay hed better check with his gp and with the local pharmacies to find out who prescribed or dispensed such a strong sedative and why and heres something the clever lads missed he should also ask dr mccallum to repeat her analysis of the stomach contents because she reports no temazepam residue there however she has a reputation for being very efficient so im sure a second check will come up with the same result meaning meaning that the drug was injected you can forget examining the body for puncture marks theyll be long gone but there can be no other conclusion i take it that no hypodermic syringe was found in the house he took her meaning at once and gave a soft whistle theres no mention of that in the papers ive read it wouldnt have been left out either it would have hit mackenzie right between the eyes in that case even though itll still be damn near impossible to prove homicide at the end of the day the inspectors investigation is still up and running however what he should be looking at first and foremost is the possibility that this old man was a temazepam junkie and that someone maybe ruths lookalike was feeding his habit skinners scowl was thunderous and stripping his assets in the process in which case its a good bet that when theyd bled him dry of cash they simply killed the poor old sod honest to god sammy pye murmured women are unpredictable creatures and you more so than any other ive ever met yesterday this mackenzie had horns and a tail today hes not such a bad bloke she laughed softly it sounded in his ear like the tinkling of a small bell thats the power of bob skinner i dont know what the boss said to him but it had a dramatic effect he couldnt have been more considerate really what about that tornfaced witch of a sergeant of his was she there no he said she was out pounding pavements youre being too hard on her she might have looked severe but she was taking her lead from mackenzie all she did in the interview room more or less was nod her head when he expected it so what did you find in your uncles house nothing somehow or other hes managed to dispose of all of his assets save the house itself on what god alone knows is mackenzie still convinced that he was murdered yes and so is mr skinner hes taking a personal interest in the investigation on my behalf i suppose thats nice of him ah but i think its professional too hes fascinated by it i think his nose has started twitching when he starts to follow it anything can happen wait till he gets a whiff of dan pringles first big case down in the borders that should stir his imagination why what does that involve a couple of ton of farmed trout missing presumed dead she beamed as she made a connection so thats what mackenzie meant yesterday at the start of the interview he made some crack about fish rustling at the time i thought he was loopy no hed know about it all right dans got an all points bulletin out on those trout she laid a hand on his chest smiling sadly as she leaned across and autographs in the rain kissed him the lives we lead sammy eh he combed his fingers through her long hair running their tips lightly down her naked back drawing a gasp from her well sergeant she whispered youve got me into bed again what do we do now let me show you he breathed the words in her ear as he eased her on to her back they kissed long and slow she felt for him down beneath the duvet but he moved downwards out of her reach licking her nipples lightly left right left again hello ladies he murmured then slid further down her body she cried out a soft scream as she felt his tongue again god sammy she moaned if i ever tell you to stop that ignore me please she thrust her pelvis upwards opening herself to his touch writhing with it until he slid back upwards and she could grasp him big and rock hard and guide him towards her towards where she wanted him she called out again louder than before as he entered her bucking and heaving beneath him surprising him with her strength exultant as he matched her they were still breathing hard lying there entwined glowing with sweat and satisfaction when the phone rang out beside the bed they looked at each other and laughed in unison let it ring he said no better answer it he reached across her and picked up the instrument yes he began still smiling his tongue working to free a hair which had become trapped between his front teeth sure sir he continued at last forcing himself to speak evenly shes right next to me ruths eyes widened as he passed her the telephone its mr skinner hes got some news for you have we got any other crime on this patch apart from vanishing bloody trout dan pringle asked detective sergeant jack mcgurk a farmer down hawick way shot a dog that was worrying his sheep sir his tall assistant replied but other than that thats it shooting a dogs not a crime to a farmer i was talking about sheepworrying boss the superintendent drew him a long look and a half smile you know son theres times i wish id left you in edinburgh weve only been here for a week and a half sir but theres times when i wish you had too listen said pringle when big bob and andy martin posted me down here they said i could take my ten favourite records one book and a familiar object the last ones you end of story he laughed at the young sergeants mock outrage ach dont worry jack therell be plenty to do down here up in the city it was as if crime came to you busy all the time its different here with different styles of crime and maybe of criminal but the basics are the same our good colleagues laugh at the notion offish rustling but its theft of property nonetheless its just as serious as a wages snatch or a jewel robbery or a housebreaking anyway if theres one thing ive learned in the two centuries in which ive been a detective officer its never to complain when things are quiet because sooner or later they wont be dont you forget that the thing which drove john mcgrigor to early retirement was the murder of his best friend in an armed robbery right in the middle of this patch mcgurk winced i suppose youre right boss he conceded anyway the fish are keeping us busy up to a point even if the chances are theyre long gone from our patch all the outstations have finished the rounds of fish farms in their areas and theres more of them than youd imagine some are just cottage industries but there are a few as big as mellerkirk autographs in the rain what sort of fish do they farm trout boss all of them theyre the only sort you can farm around here what about salmon no said the sergeant with a shake of his head salmon are farmed in salt water in the west coast sea lochs mostly and in the fjords in norway there are hatcheries on shore but theyre all close to the farm sites you seem to know a bit about this jack the superintendent remarked ive done a bit of research sir bill gates at mellerkirk was a big help so is there money in this fish farming then oh yes boss theres money in it all right but its highrisk too if youre a salmon farmer once youve put your smolts into the cages he caught pringles puzzlement smolts are young fish raised in the hatcheries once youve put them to sea you have to feed them treat them and medicate them for two years before you can harvest them its highcost longterm husbandry and it calls for patience from everyone not least the industrys bankers during that twoyear rearing period theres lots of things can go wrong the stock can become infested with sealice so they have to be constantly treated theyre subject to disease so they have to be given antibiotics theyre prey to things like red algae bloom that will kill all the fish on a farm site if it flows through it on top of that there are the grey seals tens of thousands of the buggers that can sometimes swim up to a pen and take a bite out of a fish right through the net when salmon farming started there were lots of small operations but the costs and the risks resulted in it consolidating to the point where now there are a few big producers and thats it he paused trout farmings different a much more attractive proposition as a small business less risky all round you can do it on land in sheltered sites other than a few otters and man of course there are no natural predators you can harvest your stock much quicker and sell it more easily some small farmers sell at the roadside more or less the punters walk in pick a fish and they just whip it out with a net and hit it on the head the bigger boys like mellerkirk are more sophisticated they go for volume production and sell to specialist fish shops supermarkets or processors and how many of the bigger boys have we got on our patch three replied the big sergeant one in berwickshire one just outside jedburgh and one in langholm whats their security like the langholm ones good but the other two are crap like sir adrian watson they had advice from mr mcgrigor but they felt that with a manager on site they didnt need to spend that amount of money the truth is sir in trout farming its cheaper just to insure against stock loss i must have a word with the insurers association said pringle or ask big bob if hell do it they need to change that situation meantime youd better talk to the managers dont scare them but warn them to sleep with the light on this weekend dyou know anything about them according to gates theyre both young single people like him that seems to be the type you find in that job ones a woman jeez the superintendent muttered security i dont suppose they ever go to the pub of an evening or anything like that you got the names and addresses of the owners of those two farms john mcgrigors rugby club network approach doesnt seem to have worked with these people lets see if a touch of pringle diplomacy does any better never having met sarah skinner bandit mackenzie found dr helga mccallum a break from the normal run of forensic pathologists she was tiny no more than five feet tall ash blonde and with facial features that made him think of a delicate china doll she looked as if she was in her early twenties although the policeman knew from the job she did that she was probably at least ten years older for a minute or so he felt himself falling in love until he fought it off by imagining her at work standing on tiptoe and up to her elbows in innards tm sorry to have brought you here inspector she said in a slow glasgow drawl looking round the mortuary youve taught me a professional lesson i thought it was bloody obvious that if there were no stomach traces of a drug then it was introduced by other means either up the bum or by injection obviously i have been guilty of not spelling everything out in my report it hasnt been necessary with the officers ive worked with up to now henceforth there was a cutting edge to her voice every t will be crossed and every bloody i dotted mackenzie slipped immediately into mollifying mode my fault doctor not yours the report was quite clear i just misread it im sorry to have to ask you to repeat your analysis of the stomach contents but their absence has become a crucial factor in my chain of evidence and since you might wind up in the witness box its in your interests as much as mine that were dead certain on this dont worry said dr mccallum tm well aware of that although i am used to the court taking my word on the basis of one analysis ive repeated the tests and done some others and i can promise you that the subject did not ingest temazepam within two days of his death any he may have swallowed before that would have been gone from the bloodstream by the time of death she turned stepped over to a long trolley and with a single movement of her forearm whipped away the sheet which covered it you havent met mr mcconnell have you inspector the sudden sight of the naked chalkwhite corpse with its roughly stitched incision from neck to groin made mackenzies stomach clench as if it had been gripped by a fist he felt himself gagging and hoped that it did not show dr grace was quite right in her observation the saponification of the body has made it virtually impossible to detect any puncture marks ive checked nonetheless if only to confirm there are none visible however examination of whats left of the veins of both forearms does reveal the livelihood that the subject was injected repeatedly in the period leading up to his death this old man wasnt given a fatal shot of temazepam but id say that he took it or was fed it intravenously on several occasions does that help the detective looked at the diminutive pathologist it confirms our suspicions about mr mcconnells death short of proving conclusively that he was murdered but as for finding the person who stole just about everything the poor old man had it takes us not one step further forward louise bankier was in her hotel suite when skinner arrived at the balmoral at exactly six oclock he parked his bmw directly in front of the hotel nodding to the familiar figure of the doorman on his way in and announced himself at the reception she appeared from the lift in less than two minutes walking over to him at the desk her key deposited she kissed him quickly on the cheek then took his arm as they headed for the door heads turned as they stepped out into princes street and crossed the narrow pavement to the car bob was quite certain that no one was looking at him did you get your business done he asked as he pulled out from the kerb and drove away signalling a left turn on to waverley bridge yes i did thanks he saw her nod out of the corner of his eye as he swung past the green light ive taken the part we start shooting in edinburgh next month while the christmas lights are still there i liked the script my costar will be ralph annand a very fine scottish actor and i know warren judd the producer of old hes an ex as a matter of fact husband no informal her voice dropped we didnt part friends and we havent worked together since it took a lot of soulsearching before i even began to consider doing his movie my other hesitation was that ive never worked with the director before is that a big factor bob asked it is for me im sufficiently stellar now to be able to turn down parts if even one aspect of the project doesnt feel right the relationship between cast and director is very important its his movie at least in theory it is and he can if he chooses try to impose his will on the actors so nowadays before i commit myself to anything i make sure that the director and i are thinking along the same lines and this blokes okay is he personally hes a limpwristed little jerk professionally however hes one of the real up and coming young men more than that even hes up and hes come if i can put it that way he chuckled at her earthiness you may lou but possibly not in front of the wife who is he anyway she twisted round in her seat to face him have you ever heard of elliott silver his eyebrows rose slightly ah yes him then he grinned wouldnt know him from adam who he very trendy very good hes a young londoner in his late twenties he made a couple of things for television then when he was twentyfive he wrote and directed a gangster movie set in the east end it won two b aftas and an oscar for best screenplay in the four years since then hes won two more baftas and had an oscar nomination early this year he did his first hollywood movie they say its a cert for academy awards for best picture and best director bob whistled wow and here was me thinking that a bafta was an islamic curse louise laughed philistine dont knock them he protested ive got a soft spot for the philistines they had bad reviews but even from them you can see that they were pretty good at getting the job done they were artists in their own way too look at what they did to king saul it wasnt dissimilar to some of the things that have won the turner prize in recent years he swung the car past the palace of holyroodhouse and on the right the floodlit site of the scottish parliament building how many of those things have you won he asked baftas four three film one television and oscars three plus two golden globes in the darkness of holyrood park she could see his soft smile in the dashboard light oh i remember them well he whispered her laugh was deep and raunchy theyre still doing all right moved a little south but still all right i know he said i saw that film of yours a couple of years back the one where you got your kit off that felt very weird ill tell you its as well the cinema was dark have you seen many of my movies several of them i have them on video autographs in the rain good boy youre helping to make me rich you like that do you being rich its okay why is that your ambition he shrugged a lot of people would say i am already youd probably just say that im comfortably off ive had a few legacies in my life and ive invested them well give me five years and i could retire in considerable comfort on my police pension and my investments and will you not a chance the day i feel burned out as a copper then ill go but im a hell of a lot more than five years away from that lou even back then when we were kids i had a vocation for police work and in particular for the investigative side my father wanted me to be a lawyer when i told him i was joining the police he felt let down as if the money he spent sending me to school in glasgow then to university had all been wasted but i said to him i remember it clear as daylight dad i am going to be a lawyer im going into the justice business the only difference between your ambition for me and my own is that i want to work at the sharp end and you know what he replied he looked at me and muttered i bred a fucking idealist but the last thing he ever said to me the night before he died was son you were right on the two occasions in my career when for a fleeting moment ive thought why bob why thats been my answer he drew to a halt in the queue at the willowbrae traffic lights and glanced sideways at lou her profile framed in the lights of the mercedes dealership how about you why do you do it it hasnt brought you happiness i can tell that so what is it fame money she laughed but it was a brittle sound of course it is especially money the traffic began to move through the lights and he eased forward with it i am happy bob really not like you are with your wife and young family but im happy with what i do even way back then the very day i met you when i joined your squash club because i wanted you that same day i joined the drama society because i wanted that even more when we split it was because you followed your presbyterian conscience but if wed stayed together then id have left you eventually for my other lover either that or id have destroyed your life i spent a long time wondering what it was about why i was addicted to autographs in the rain the hot lights the roar of the greasepaint the smell of the crowd as they say for a while i thought i was the most selfindulgent being alive and then one night i was in los angeles at an academy award ceremony i wasnt nominated that year so when it was over i started to leave to meet some man at some party somewhere it had started to rain during the show and it was hammering down outside like a bloody monsoon it was chaotic some very famous people were running for their limos under inadequate umbrellas and twentythousanddollar dresses were being ruined in five seconds flat in the middle of it all i saw a man he was a singer a minor figure in the movie industry but a legend in his own field he was standing there his buckskin jacket soaked his long hair plastered to his head and he was signing autographs not just one or two but dozens maybe hundreds for all the people who were pressed around him wanting a piece of him i dont know how long i watched him standing there signing those soggy books teeshirts programmes anything as best he could as all those bloody movie stars ignored the crowds and ran as fast as their dignity and their heels would allow but eventually someone spotted me shouted to me above the noise louise and waved a baseball cap at me i walked out from under the marquee into the rain i took the marker pen he gave me and i signed watching the ink run even as i wrote then another and another the signatures were barely legible and probably didnt survive the night but i knew as that singer knew that it didnt matter those people out there in the storm were representatives of all those who make people like me i hate the word fans they are our patrons they give us something of themselves love if nothing else and its our solemn duty to give them something back even if it does cause us momentary discomfort so thats why i do it bob so that i can sign autographs in the rain they drove on in silence for a while leaving the city lights behind they had just turned off the a when louise reached out and touched his cheek speaking in general terms of course do you ever wonder she asked quietly what it would be like to be with someone again an old lover after a quarter of a century would it be as good as it was would it be better would it be a letdown in your deepest thoughts do you ever wonder that i cant speak in general terms lou he murmured in terms of bygone lovers myras dead there was someone i never want to see again and there are a couple of others i can barely remember which leaves only you i can only speak of you of course i wonder do you think i could ever forget what it was like we were only youngsters you and i but we were tremendous together today given maturity experience and everything else sure most people might be tempted to play those scenes over again but not me its a delicious thought but thats all it can be for me at least because where i am now is where i want to stay for the rest of my life i am happier than i have ever imagined in ten minutes or so youll find out why just suppose you and i did indulge ourselves even just for one night we could contrive the circumstances without difficulty and afterwards say thanks and walk away sarah would never know or even suspect but id know id know id betrayed her the kids the whole thing and because i had even though id got clean away with it and things might appear to be as perfect as before he tapped his chest in here they would never be quite the same again i speak from experience here i only have what i have now because sarah was tough enough to see us through our tough time that alone means that i feel guilty even fantasising about you theres something else he added i love her like crazy and id die before id betray her again dont get me wrong lou he said glancing across at her i cherish the memory of the time we had as youngsters we were perfection together even if it was too good to last however it can provide a great foundation for lifelong friendship if we both see it that way deal he took his right hand from the wheel and held it out she smiled and shook it firmly deal she said not even for the part of the world which i dont yet have would i spoil what you have now for the truth be told my old love to be as happy as you away from all the glitz and glam is what i want for myself far more than another fifty oscars they drove on towards gullane bobs eyes on the road louise looking out of the window at the lights across the forth as they reached the village bob shifted in his seat oh he exclaimed i almost forgot alex cant make it tonight so we have another dinner companion my pal and colleague neil hell be your taxi back to edinburgh too hes probably there ahead of us one word of explanation rather than warning about him his wife died less than a year ago so if he seems a bit withdrawn thats why he chuckled dont go thinking hes starstruck or anything big mcllhenneys the least impressionable guy i know what exactly is it that you do in bobs team neil asked louise as mcllhenneys car accelerated out of gullane towards the amber glow which hung in the sky over edinburgh we talked about everything but that i noticed one thing though you never called him by his christian name all night not once sarah yes but not him all the other policemen we talked about dan pringle andy martin mario mcguire maggie rose all first names but not him i cant to his face the big darkhaired man answered quietly i respect him too much hes told me i should away from the office but ive told him i just cant do it he gave a soft laugh not till he promotes me another three ranks at any rate its a police thing part of being in a disciplined service an inspector might be on firstname terms with a chief inspector when there are no pcs around maybe even with a superintendent if theyve come through the ranks together but when an officer moves into the command corridor when he becomes an acc or a dcc he goes on to another level his rank carries with it an extra degree of respect if hes bob skinner it makes him a demigod although he could not see it she smiled at him and to think he told me you were the least impressionable man he knows maybe hes right but hes the exception although it would embarrass him to know it im not alone bobs greatness is that although hes the most natural leader any of us who work with him have ever met hes also a man of the people thats what the word police means you know if you trace it back to its root linguistically policemen and politicians are both the same thing men of the people now isnt that bloody ironic how a single root could have produced such different fruits the twain never meet not quite chief officers have to live with politicians so they have to acquire some of their skills proud jimmy sir james proud our chief has them under his thumb and mr chase our new acc is that sort of animal too but a police officer with a politicians duplicity now hed be a dangerous man what about bob he hates them hed drown the buggers at birth the irony is that he used to work for them as an adviser but one secretary of state let him down he walked away from that job and hes never forgiven the man sifice is that politician still in office no you dont want to get on the bosss wrong side thats the irony you see he hates politicians yet hes hugely influential himself hes come to realise that too maybe he should become a politician himself then louise suggested new blood to change the breed youre right i travel internationally and its the same everywhere i go politicians have become so ideologically inbred that you cant tell them apart neil shuddered dont wish that on him please if bob skinner ever went into politics hed be like julius bloody caesar hed frighten the weak and the venal among his enemies so much that eventually theyd pluck up the courage to kill him some of the oldguard lefties on the police board have tried already metaphorically she chuckled at his reaction okay i withdraw that wish they drove on in silence for a while there was a new moon but the night was clear and crisp out on the firth of forth lights shone on several moored tankers and rigs hey exclaimed louise suddenly you didnt answer my question what do you do in bobs team tm his exec his adc his personal assistant andy martin the head of cid calls me his vicar on earth so youll know where all the bodies are buried then those that i dont know about i dont want to know about did he tell you about the trouble in london last friday night i know about that was there an aftermath he mentioned something on the way out neil detected an underlying concern in her question there was but it lasted about two minutes a highranker in the met did something very autographs in the rain stupid he doubted my bosss judgement and worse his word he wont do that again let me guess he went on looking across at her youre blaming yourself for letting him stick you in a taxi and get you out of there before the police turned up sort of well dont he doesnt use his position very often but when he does its for the right reasons in this case he made you disappear to protect you from the possibility of unwanted publicity and to protect sarah as well louise nodded i understand that now shes a stunner isnt she and those children are lovely all children are lovely mcllhenney murmured in the dark even those that aint how many do you have she asked two lauren and spencer laurens eleven going on twenty spencer is nine going on ten how about you do you have children no ive never been in one place or one marriage long enough the upside is that apart from one time about twentyfive years ago ive never stayed long enough to get really hurt either she sighed in the dark god i shouldnt have said that should i not to you its okay honestly no one can say anything thatll make it hurt any worse than it does already its better when people dont walk on eggshells around you im just younger than the average widower or widow thats all you know what i sat in the church during olives service and i thought of all the couples gathered round me and i realised that one out of every pair will sit in a frontrow seat at a funeral one day its part of the deal if its a good marriage the hurt is a cross worth bearing even though you might be selfish enough to wish that she was the one left to bear it so really dont feel awkward or sorry for me louise envy me if you like but dont pity me spontaneously she reached out and squeezed his arm sorry she said t mean they laughed in harmony jesus christ she exclaimed suddenly sounding more glaswegian what a bloody evening i havent had a deep conversation with a man in five years or more and here ive had two in one night autographs in the rain id better just shut up then for a moment she thought he was being serious oh no she said quickly dont do that i like talking to you i like meeting someone who isnt impressed by who i am or what i do who said i wasnt youre a scottish heroine louise right up there with connery even if you are about forty years younger thats very gallant of you sir but actually im just under thirty years younger how old are you pushing forty hard dont worry about it its no big deal in fact i find it better to think of myself as being in my early forties than in my late thirties til bear that in mind the truth is the only age ambition i have is to stick around long enough to see the kids through university after that i can keep my date any time your date i had a dream a few weeks after it was about a grey bridge olive was on the other side i was able to see her but i couldnt cross not then he broke off sorry this is getting heavy again hey she said not having to say sorry cuts both ways you know you dont need to worry about what you say to me either i get fan mail neil people tell me all sort of things some of them would break your heart but i still read them he smiled across at her youre quite a lady louise for an actress and youre quite a bloke for a copper you must have some interrogation technique just like bobs i suppose not at all in fact i let people talk to me he makes them as he spoke he drove through the traffic lights at the foot of waterloo place and pulled up outside the balmoral thanks neil she said for the lift and the deep conversation my pleasure louise lou please call me lou all my real friends do he stepped out of the car and went round to open her door but she had let herself out and stood waiting for him on the pavement this is where i let myself down he said big and sheepish can i have your autograph just a punter at heart eh she laughed as he found a pen and fumbled in his pockets for a piece of paper ill send you a photograph signed to neil spencer and lauren will i post it to the office god no some bugger would open it send it to my home address he found a business card scribbled on the back and gave it to her til tell you what she said im off to london tomorrow then im back here next friday for another meeting about the movie and im staying until weve done all our location shots ill deliver it myself if you like would you that would be really nice of you the kids would love it he stood there watching her as she stepped into the hotel see you then she called with a final wave bob rolled over on to his back and sensed that sarah although he was lyiilg still was awake also whats up he whispered nothing at all i was just lying here thinking about this evening and about louise shes a very nice lady not at all precious considering all she is thats a scots thing he told her jocks and jockesses who make it big internationally in entertainment or sports have to be very careful when they come home if theyre even suspected of putting on airs and graces they dont half catch it in the neck we like our heroes to be ordinary sometimes we even like them to be fallen lou could never turn into a prima donna though she was always too nice a girl for that shes beautiful now so she must have been a stunner as a girl he whistled softly she could see his smile in the pale light of the bedside alarm clock oh she was i remember the first time i saw her in a crowded corridor at the freshers fair i was flogging squash club membership i knew just from looking at her that shed never played in her life hardly anyone did then but i pitched her just the same was it tough to leave her you better believe it i shouldnt have got involved in the first place myra and i had just got engaged so i was spoken for but she did my head in just your head aye okay that too she frowned arent you surprised shes never settled down herself not really back then she was always looking for something without knowing what it was she still is i think maybe back then she was looking for you autographs in the rain she heard him chuckle nah her ambitions ran beyond me even then as shed tell you herself did you ever regret it which getting involved or chucking her i should have regretted the first but i never did as for leaving her to be honest it was touch and go which of them i split with but i wouldnt have made lou happy longterm i know that now although i didnt at the time no i stayed with myra because she had a hold on me i loved her plus she had me fucking hypnotised just like everyone else but its worked out we had alex then down the road you came along and the kids the icing on the cake of my charmed life she rolled towards him oh youre working well tonight she murmured the inescapable telephone rang quietly by the bedside whothehellisthat bob grumbled but as always he picked it up bob andy martin sounded tense sorry but youll want to hear this ive just had the manager of the balmoral on the blower in a flap theres been a fire in a guests suite its louise bankiers shes a friend of yours isnt she skinner sat bolt upright is she all right smoke inhalation martin answered shell be all right but theyve sent for an ambulance okay tell them to take her to the murrayfield hospital not the royal then call there and make sure theyre ready to receive and treat her if its nonemergency shell be more comfortable there and shell have more privacy im on my way there now he paused hey andy how come the manager called you because hes shitting himself he says it wasnt an accident ive no idea how it happened andy exclaimed guy bronte the general manager of the balmoral hotel i only know that as soon as the senior fire officer looked at it he said that it couldnt have been ignited by accident tell me what happened exactly it was just after am the fire alarm went off and our board pinpointed the location as number twoten miss bankiers suite i was sleeping here tonight rather than at home so i was wakened with everyone else when we got to the room one of my undermanagers opened the door with an emergency pass key our sprinkler system had dealt with the outbreak by that time but there was still a lot of smoke around miss bankier was still lying in bed soaked by the spray and coughing very badly we have a doctor as a guest tonight he examined her and said that she was in no danger but recommended hospitalisation as a precaution the ambulance took her away ten minutes ago did you evacuate the hotel yes but only very briefly we were able to let everyone return to their rooms almost at once are the firemen still here asked martin yes theyre up in twoten that was a daft question the detective murmured to himself as an afterthought with a fucking big fire appliance parked outside bronte led the way up to the second floor using the stairs rather than the lift even though the firefighters had declared the emergency officially over a bulky figure in a fire suit and white helmet stood outside the door for all his armour the chief superintendent recognised him at once hello matt he called out youre a bit overdressed for this one thats the way i like them son said the veteran divisional officer matthew grogan theres nothing nicer than turning up at a fire to find that its out autographs in the rain no that this one really was a fire mind you what do you mean it was the smoke alarm in the room that went off but there was nae flame so what was it a pair of smoke canisters hidden in a laundry basket with a timer on it that must have been set for two in the morning or thereabouts together theyd have generated a hell of an amount of smoke it was nontoxic the sort of stuff that we use in our training exercises but you wouldnt know that if you were in the middle of the stuff its bloody realistic and if you inhale enough of it youll still have a right bad cough the woman in this room must have had a hell of a fright what was her name anyway grogan nodded in the direction of bronte who was heading towards the stairs she had an oxygen mask on when the paramedics wheeled her out of the room they transferred her into that fella got all coy when i asked him who she was he said that he wisnae at liberty to say ah nearly told him that i was at liberty to close his fucking hotel but what the hell so who is she shes a friend of bob skinner martin told him i asked guy to keep the name quiet because to be frank i didnt want any of your boys to be tempted to make a few quid by phoning a tip to one of the tabloids dont take it personally though matt dont worry son the big fireman assured him i live in the real world you were right wheres the device in here i had a good look at it but i didnt touch it the ignition blew the lid off the basket so it got soaked like everything else martin looked into the suite it was in fact a single large room with a seating area and a double bed against the far wall every item in it carpets furniture bedding was drenched with water the baskets in the bathroom said grogan there was a towel in it over the canisters maybe the woman chucked it in herself or maybe someone put it in there so she wouldnt see them if she looked in thats quite likely the detective concurred well find out soon enough he reached into the pocket of his leather jacket for his mobile meantime id better get a cid team along here twentyfive years on bob skinner grinned and you still look just as good in bed i promise you i dont feel as good louise replied in a hoarse whisper she lay in a bluecovered bed in a wellappointed private room in fact she said i feel as if ive had something large rough and hard down my throat just like old times then he muttered wickedly she started to laugh then broke into a coughing fit quickly he poured her a glass of water from a jug by the bedside and handed it to her no more funnies please she entreated him when the paroxysm had passed i really am bloody sore no more i promise you fed me that one though you have to admit you always had an earthy sense of humour ms bankier he paused and the smile left his face the problem is that someone out there isnt seeing the joke any more what do you mean she whispered frowning back at him he sat on the edge of her bed and took her hand in his i mean my dear that what happened in your room tonight wasnt an accident she gasped and he felt her grip tighten what her question tailed off someone planted a smokebomb in the linen basket in your suite timed to go off during the night she stared at him astonished you mean someone tried to kill me i dont think so the smoke itself was harmless there was just a hell of a lot of it someone did want to give you a fright though at the very least he looked at her as if he was choosing his words very carefully which raises a clear and obvious probability one that should have occurred to me before but didnt maybe because ive fallen victim to my own legend conversely maybe it didnt occur to you because you havent autographs in the rain last friday nights incident might well have had nothing to do with me it might not have been random given whats just happened im bloody near certain that it was aimed at you her eyes widened her mouth opened as if to speak then her throat constricted and she started to cough she sipped more water until she was settled lou he asked her quietly have you ever suspected that you might have a stalker she stared at him then at the wall then out of the window suddenly outside a lion roared she started eyes widening still further bob smiled at her surprise dont be alarmed edinburgh zoos right next door what is this place its a private hospital i thought it would be better for you if you came here listen we can talk about this in the morning ill have the staff give you a knockout pill for tonight but when you waken i want you to think about what ive just asked you you be okay to leave here in the morning but do you have to go back to london she shrugged her shoulders wincing at the movement my schedule for next week was learning the script for my new movie thats all that and packing for a longer stay up here but other than that no i dont have to you have an assistant dont you i have a secretary shes based at my agents office would you trust her to pack for you and to courier the cases up here sure good in that case i want you to stay up here under my protection i dont want you in a hotel though you can move into our spare room for a while no she snapped the word out with no little discomfort if someones after me bob i dont want to be anywhere near sarah or your children okay he conceded well find another solution longterm but for a couple of days youll be okay in gullane no one will know where you are other than you and us thatll give us time to find you a safe house bob she protested im not living like a prisoner i cant no but we can take precautions she smiled and gave in back to the old days again better than dealing with it after its happened you get some sleep now phone your secretary first thing in the morning ill be back to pick you up around ten dan pringle opened one eye experimentally exposure to light did not send a shaft of pain shooting through his head and so he opened the other what time did we get in last night he asked huskily about two thirty he turned round to see his wife standing beside their bed with a mug of tea in her hand dan she said severely you had better be aware that am not driving you back from edinburgh to galashiels every friday night in life we have moved and thats that get used to it like many police officers dan pringle enjoyed a drink he enjoyed also to get away from the job at least once a week among a group of friends with whom he could discuss sport sex current affairs and even politics on occasion but never work the biggest sacrifice which he had made in revitalising his cid career was in wrenching himself away from his social circle to move on to his new borders territory i know love he sighed last night was a oneoff i promise it was only our second friday away i had to have a fix well if you want another countered elma pringle you can get a patrol car to run you home afterwards dan pulled himself up in bed oh no i cant do that jim elder was bad enough about cid using pandas as taxis but this new acc ops chase hed have my guts theres a story about that willie michaels got a car to take him back to broxburn after a masonic dinner in edinburgh and when chase found out about it he sent him a bill for the equivalent taxi fare the ops room superintendent was telling me that he has his lackey jack good spotcheck the logged patrol movements every day looking for that very thing why should you call inspector good a lackey ive never heard you speak like that about di mcllhenney and he does the same job for mr skinner or about jack mcgurk for that matter does he hell as like jack goods a tea boy in uniform big neils a firstclass detective doing a valuable cid liaison job and hes a hard man to boot goods next job will be to draw his pension neils will be on up the ladder either to special branch or deputy divisional commander id have him down here ill tell you as for jack mcgurk hes a good lad too i trust jack i like him close to me thats good elma remarked because hes downstairs hes what for christs sake why didnt you tell me i just did anyway didnt you hear the doorbell i heard fuck all dan moaned climbing out of bed and stumbling into th ensuite shower room give him a coffee and tell him ill be down in ten minutes what time is it ten to ten jesus ill bet im the only copper has his saturday morning disrupted better than you disrupting mine with your bloody snoring ill tell him but you hurry up jack mcgurk had just finished the scotsman saturday sports section when his boss appeared in his living room unshaven but showered and dressed in jeans and a crewnecked sweater what the hell brings you here the superintendent growled his greeting fish the sergeant growled back pringle seemed to stop in midstride never you mean weve found it no sir mcgurk replied i mean weve lost another few tons there were times when the young detective regretted being six feet four it meant that there was more of him to be glared at jesus christ pringle barked how the fuck did we manage that i dont know yet sir where was it howdengate trout farm thats the one just outside jedburgh ive called di dorwards forensic team down the owner and the manager should be waiting for us when we get there aye okay the superintendent muttered resigned to the loss of his saturday but thankful that he had declined the last whisky on offer the night before let me run my shaver over my chin and well be on our way youre driving son are you sure hell be here asked andy martin skinner nodded its a clear morning there was no reply when i called the house and his mobiles switched off theres nowhere else hell be he pointed across the playing fields look there he is across three practice rugby fields in the training area behind murrayfield stadium half a dozen minipitches had been laid out neil mcllhenney bulky in a north face fleece stood on the touchline of the third walking towards him skinner and martin saw him tense as a small figure in white shorts and a red bib took a pass from the player inside and accelerated effortlessly towards the line leaving his immediate opponent floundering in his wake as he touched the ball down mcllhenney punched the air with his right hand by his side a rangy darkhaired girl jumped up and down clapping then she caught sight of the two newcomers and tugged at her fathers shoulder lovely turn of speed neil said martin hes got the gift as he runs of making his marker think hes got a chance and getting him to commit himself far too early you just cant teach that if his basic speed grows with him and he keeps that knack id say he could be a bit special mcllhenney nodded not trying to disguise his pride thats what the coaches here say too martin glanced at the two adults on the field who were rounding up their sides now that the final whistle had gone i know these guys i played with them and against them theyre top class so were you pal skinner murmured you gave up the game far too soon i know his friend conceded but theres no point in dwelling on it on the other hand i played ten years too soon if i had carried on and suppose i had done all the things they said i was capable of caps british lions all that stuff where would i be now retired and sitting in the stands watching guys who couldnt have laced my boots making silly money for playing the game while i did it for love and travel expenses now you pal he said as spencer mcllhenney ran towards them with a fair wind a run of luck and given that you get to be the size of your old man youve got a future hello mr skinner the boy called out did you come to watch me spence lauren chided her brother dont be silly ah but i did and to talk to your dad mcllhenney ruffled his sons hair go and get changed and have your iovril ill see you back at the car as the youngster ran off he handed the keys to lauren go on ahead of us honey while i talk to mr skinner and mr martin as she took them from him and turned to leave them bob watched her tall for her age almost ready to burst into womanhood she was a younger version of her mother so much so that he wondered whether on occasion it broke neils heart just to look at her im a lucky man eh said the inspector what a legacy now what dug you two from the bosoms of your respective families you didnt just come to see mine no the dcc admitted it has to do with lou after you dropped her off last night she had a mishap he outlined what had happened in louise bankiers suite and was struck by the mix of horror and anxiety which crossed the face of his exec who the hell would do a thing like that to the woman he exclaimed im betting that its the same bastard who fired that shotgun in london last friday night not at me but at lou do either of you disagree with that assumption no said the head of cid someones stalking her trying to scare the life out of her a blank cartridge then a smoke bomb nasty stuff yes but whos to say that the next one wont be lethal we have to assume that it will be and we have to give her protection who she is the fact that shes a friend of mine that doesnt come into it theres a clear threat to her safety and she has to be protected at the same time we have to keep it quiet this sort of craziness can bring all sorts of bugs out of the woodwork we dont want any copycatting however theres a limit to what we can do lou has a movie commitment fortunately its here in edinburgh but she wont cancel it autographs in the rain no mcllhenney murmured shes not the sort of lady to be frightened into seclusion exactly so we have to help her get on with her life as safely as we can we need a safe house then boss the inspector suggested she wont have it but i wont have her in a hotel nor will she agree to stay at my place not with the kids there she says as if i couldnt fortify it but there it is so what i plan to do is have her rent a house for her stay here a detached house not a flat or a semi install certain security devices that she doesnt need to know about like geophones to detect movement in the garden and an alarm system linked to the nearest nick or somewhere suitable then im going to persuade her to bring her secretary up here for company as much as anything else on top of all that i want to give her a minder someone to watch over her to make sure she gets to work safely then home at night to take her shopping if she wants to go to keep an eye on her if she wants to go out for a meal got anyone in mind mcllhenney asked casually yes you but its not an order it doesnt need to be of course ill do it he frowned there is just one problem though i know said skinner and ive anticipated it if there is an emergency you cant just run off and leave lauren and spence so that girl you have as a parttime help dyou think shed work for you on a livein basis for the duration of this job dont worry about the added cost i can take care of that til have to ask her boss but im sure she will neil paused but what about sammy pye hes single maybe but hes too young whoever does this job has to be someone with whom lou can feel comfortable and safe she knows you plus she likes you i could tell that last night over dinner besides sammys full of ruth mcconnell at the moment and ruthie has her own problems with her uncles death and its aftermath he looked from one friend to the other so thats it sorted then neil youll look after her andy youll catch the bastard whos after her the approach to howdengate trout farm was the opposite of that to mgllerkirk it ran along a tight steepsided valley through which a river ran pringle was in no mood for a walk so mcgurk drove his astra along the rough forest track looking ahead carefully for boulders they drove through woods for over a mile until they came suddenly to an end and the unmade road opened out into a flat field with hills rising on either side in the middle distance they saw a number of buildings close to the river and next to several large rectangular tanks halfburied in the ground looks bigger than the other one the superintendent observed it is sir if the size of the loss is anything to go by when i spoke to the manager he estimated the stock nicked at four tons whats his name arthur symonds mcgurk replied hell be waiting for us with the owner his names glenn lander like sir adrian watson he owns the estate on which the farm stands trouts an extension of his business the sergeant drew to a halt beside half a dozen cars which were parked beside the first building as the detectives climbed out two men walked towards them they were both in their twenties one was very tall taller even than mcgurk by a few inches but more heavily built with fair hair the other was stocky with a ruddy complexion and very wide shoulders in build he reminded pringle of andy martin as he approached with hand outstretched he imagined him too in the back row of the scrum looking at the other man he guessed that he might pack down immediately in front mr pringle im glenn lander and this is my manager arthur symonds morning the policeman shook the landowners hand and nodded sideways this is ds mcgurk he was pleasantly surprised by the contrast between lander and sir adrian watson but he saw no reason to show it well gentlemen he barked have you two been living on another planet i mean after what autographs in the rain happened last weekend how the hell could you manage to lose another farmful of fresh fucking fish arthur symonds blushed bright red it was my fault im afraid id have done the same thing art said lander at once dont blame yourself because i wont so what did happen you guys were warned werent you to keep the farm guarded overnight aye we were the giant agreed and i was here only i had a phone call just before midnight from the police in hawick or so they said they told me that my father had been hit by a car on his way home from the pub and that he was critical they told me that they were taking him to the borders general but that it was touch and go whether or not he made it i never thought or doubted it for a second i just jumped in the land rover and bombed out of here when i got to the hospital they didnt know what the fuck i was talking about eventually i worked out what might have happened and called glenn you never thought to call home before you went tearing off my dad lives alone mr pringle hes in the pub every friday night and every friday night hes the worse for drink no just fridays either i just took it at face value so how long would it have been before you realised youd been set up symonds knotted his eyebrows i never thought to check my watch but given the time it took me to get up to gala then the time i spent farting about the place trying to find my old man it would have been over an hour anyway the superintendent looked at the young estate owner and you mr lander how did you react when mr symonds called you apart from calling him a dimwitted fucking secondrower you mean then having to apologise to my girlfriend for my language after what happened to mellerkirk last weekend i jumped straight out of bed and drove to the farm i was here inside ten minutes didnt you ever stop to wonder what youd have done if youd driven right into the middle of them no but id a shotgun in my jeep pringle ran a hand over his eyes i never heard that son he murmured so what did you find he continued an empty farm basically there was nothing here but a lot of tyre tracks a few fish left swimming in the tanks and a few dead ones on the ground and floating on the surface did you pass any large vehicles heading in the opposite direction as you were driving here i didnt pass anything mr pringle i hit a deer on the road but that was all i saw how many people do you employ here sir two in addition to art then we have a vet who looks in regularly to check on the stock iwell want to speak to all of them glenn lander reached into a pocket i guessed as much he said pulling out a single sheet of paper there are their names and addresses he made to hand it to pringle but jack mcgurk took it from him do you have doubts about any of them asked the sergeant no ive known the two workers since i was a kid and mr gibb the vet has looked after the estate since god was a boy well talk to them nonetheless said pringle who are your insurers i assume you are covered royal sun alliance mmm mellerkirks with cgu lander laughed just as well one company might not have fancied two claims in a week the bluff superintendent snorted i think youll find that the big commercial insurers all compare notes youd better budget for double the premium next year unless he barked suddenly you finally take police advice and install decent security itd still have to be costeffective mr pringle we can arrange that by advising the companies to adjust their premiums accordingly they take police advice as well you know and ill make damn sure they get it i dont like being hauled out on a saturday because you boys are too tight to pay for proper alarms and surveillance equipment the landowner shrugged his wide shoulders do that if you must now can art and i go weve got a game up at raebura place this afternoon edinburgh accies seconds dont let us keep you then the superintendent muttered but dont let the opposition sell the big yin here any dummies hes bought one already this weekend autographs in the rain lander laughed and the two turned to leave symonds wearing a wounded look on his lofty face the detectives watched them as they drove off then walked across to one of the men who were left on the site he was wearing a white tunic with black wellingtons and he had red hair morning arthur pringle called out solved the crime yet detective inspector dorward head of the forensics unit turned and scowled at him as he stepped out of a tapedoff area you wish sir he said sourly i got no fingerprints off any dead fish last week and i dont suppose these be any different can you tell us anything oh yes i can always tell you something last week i told you that there were four people involved in the raid going by the footprints that were left around they were all wearing wellies we established from the casts we took that three sets were cheap ownbrand jobs bought almost certainly from milletts but the fourth was a more expensive brand whose stockists include dickson and tiso both of edinburgh and various other countrywear specialists judging by what ive seen so far id say that the same people did this and going by the tyre tracks id say that they used the same two vehicles two oh yes sir that volume offish and water takes some shifting is there any chance of you being able to follow the vehicles to their destination by following the mud on their tracks asked jack mcgurk dorward eyed the tall sergeant up and down then looked at pringle as if over the top of imaginary spectacles who is this dan he murmured your faithful redskin companion he turned back to mcgurk if you look up he said you will see dark clouds you should see them okay since youre a lot closer to them than i am its going to rain any minute now and the forecast is that it will spread to all parts by midafternoon on top of that the track through those woods leads to a minor road which leads very shortly thereafter to a trunk road which in turn has had traffic pounding up and down it all night i can take a sample of mud here and if you find these vehicles ill probably be able to prove for you that they were here thats bloody clever as it is lad i draw the line at the impossible the redhaired inspector turned and went back to his whitecoated team pringle grinned up at his aide nice one tonto he chuckled now heres what you will do everyones come up kosher at mellerkirk so far but the possibility remains that it was an inside job if this was an inside job as well then with the same thieves involved there is a chance that its a conspiracy so i want you to have our people check into all the staff at the two farms to see if theres any connection between any of them but if its anyone i fancy the managers gates just happened to be off watch last weekend and symonds says he had what turned out to be a hoax phone call ibut we can verify that he had a call sir can you verify that he wasnt expecting it i tell you jack the team thats doing it either has inside info or its done its homework bloody well to know about symonds father being a piss artist the lad gates and big lurch there i want them watched ill get people on to it sir the superintendent scowled again and tugged at his moustache one thing does seem bloody clear though sergeant these people must have an outlet somewhere they stole three tons last weekend now another four theres no way theyre going to stockpile seven tons of frozen trout theyve found a buyer for the first lot already its the only explanation and if they can shift this lot quickly as well theyll be on the lookout for more exactly son so its up to us to be waiting for them if they do and if there is someone on the inside that could be bloody difficult can you really do all that for me louise bankier asked the remnants of lunch lay scattered around her seonaid was gnawing happily on a rattle in her high chair abandoned by her brothers who were watching cartoons in their playroom not just for you bob skinner assured her id do it for anyone in your situation not that ive ever had anyone in your situation before its a bit unusual in scotland but my colleagues down south have as a matter of fact protection from stalkers was on the agenda at my london conference its been decided to treat it as a form of terrorism which is exactly what it is what about your secretary sarah interposed can you bring her up here louise nodded yes id have done that anyway for the duration of the edinburgh filming glenys always goes on the payroll when im working on a movie name on the end titles and everything after the dress designer but before the hairdresser shes single then she has a boyfriend but ill fly him up at weekends so they dont miss each other only after hes been thoroughly vetted said bob but i know him hes been to my house fine but he doesnt get in again without being quietly checked out sorry to lapse into policespeak but in nine crimes against the person out often the victim knows the attacker he read her expression dont worry lou i say vetted but he wont feel a thing i promise unless hes our man in which case hell feel plenty the man in the car in london she said i know you didnt see his face but did you notice anything about him skin tone for example yes he was white i saw his hand it wasnt clarence then hes black and very darkskinned then thats a relief but im still not making any exceptions to security procedures please lou forget about that side of it thats our business and my people are good at it he poured her more coffee are you happy with neil as your minder very happy i like him and he strikes me as formidable too im sure ill feel safe with him around but can you spare him from your office i have a very good secretary just like you she can cope for a while anyway he added it wont be for long i intend to catch this bastard double quick and lock him up lets hope you do she glanced out of the window towards the sea it looked grey and cold the threatened rain had made its way up from the borders and was falling hard i dont like this feeling of being constrained ive never suffered from claustrophobia before but thats what this feels like im just like everyone else i like mixing with people and i know that not being able to will do my head in it neednt be as bad as that with neil around you can go out she looked at him i really should too shouldnt i she suggested you wont catch this man unless he shows himself again will you maybe we will but its unlikely isnt it yes of course it is but how will you draw him out if youve got me holed up in a house somewhere honest to god even if i was ruthless enough to use you as bait i dont think id need to this man followed you to soho with me he followed you to edinburgh and he found your room number in the balmoral hell find out where youre living all right maybe if were lucky just trying to will get him caught but i doubt it sometimes people like this are dumber than you think but it always pays to assume that theyre intelligent he must be to have got into my hotel room not really said bob what did you do with your key when you were out here last night you dont need to tell me you walked over to me at reception left it there and then we headed off in my car youre our stalker you distract the receptionist for ten seconds and youre in there but how do you put the key back uncle bob a small voice came from beside the fridge skinner looked over his shoulder in surprise and saw mark standing behind him with a sevenup in each hand you dont son its a card key you see so all you do is go down to the foyer again wait till the receptionists back is turned and i autographs in the rain chuck it on the floor behind the desk he grinned at his adopted son reaching out a hand to ruffle his hair clever little soandso though arent you ill make you either a master criminal or an ace detective when you grow up whichll it be detective mark replied at once better security and longterm prospects the three adults laughed as he headed back to the playroom you think hes kidding bob joked hell have worked that out marks always had a phenomenal memory now hes developing the mental power to back it up what hes actually going to be is a mathematician and probably before he grows up at that he rapped the table top but back to our discussion see how mark wandered in here without us noticing him thats how easily the stalker could have got into your room god louise murmured what advantages do we have privacy for the moment youre out of the spotlight for now in that nobody knows where you are possibly one other edge also if this mans from out of town and lets assume he is theres just a chance that he doesnt know who and what i am that illusion lasted for five minutes longer until the phone rang ive found a house boss neil mcllhenney announced i checked the to let section in the espc office after we all split up there was a place listed in craiglockhart avenue a detached bungalow rang the viewing number and had a look its newly refurbished new kitchen and stuff very well furnished with a nice big open garden that you couldnt hide a mouse in to cap it all its just a couple of minutes walk from my place couldnt be better we can show it to lou tomorrow afternoon if you like keith stanleys the letting solicitor we know him so he shouldnt be hard to deal with skinner smiled at his execs pleasure over a job well done yeah well do that you make the arrangements and tell us where and when well meet you there fine said mcllhenney theres one more thing i just had a call from alan royston the press officer he was a bit leery about phoning you but theres a piece in the news today in their gossip column it talks about lou being seen leaving the balmoral last night and here i quote looking starstruck herself on the arm of a very senior edinburgh policeman roystons already had the news of the screws the sunday mail the people and the sunday herald on the blower he wants to know how he should play it shit skinner snapped drawing startled looks from the two women tell him to play it straight neil the plain truth that were old friends from way back and that i was taking lou to dinner with family and friends tell him also to make it clear what will happen if anyone as much as suggests anything different thanks mate see you tomorrow what was that sarah asked if our man was in any doubt about who i am he knows now courtesy of our wellmeaning and very wellinformed local evening newspaper are you sure im on overtime for this dave gwendoline dell looked at the detective inspector doubtfully dont worry about that gwennie he told her in a tone of voice which made her worry even more til square it with the dci on monday anyway look at me im missing out on the joys of an afternoon in the st enoch centre with the wife and weans no wonder they call you bandit she muttered looking out of the car at the bungalow and at the rain which was lashing down okay im here now will you tell me why mackenzie nodded ach gwennie its just well ive always fancied you and heres an empty house her mouth fell open in astonishment she glared at him with instant fury until she saw the laughter in his eyes if you didnt sign my fitness reports she exclaimed listen cut the crap what are we here for its that bag that the old dear told you about ive been wondering about it bigger than a handbag she said big enough to make her think that ruth had come for the weekend ive been wondering what was in it and why if it was that bulky and she wasnt staying for the weekend she bothered to bring it into the house unless there was something in it she needed he smiled at her again the obvious answer is that there was something in it she needed drugs dell suggested she could have got a whole fucking pharmacy in there even if were right and she was feeding the old mans habit she could have carried the temazepam and the works in her pocket no there was something else in that bag all joking over he looked at the sergeant ive been trying to think like skinner he told her he impressed you that much he nodded emphatically that much just talking to him changed my outlook on a lot of things we were trained to look for the obvious first and foremost so was he but once he sees it he questions it he told me that when he was in the field hed turn up at a crime scene and ask himself a few simple questions what type of crime was this was it opportunistic or was it premeditated was it driven by anger or financial gain was it a stupid crime or was it well planned ive been asking myself all those questions and i find myself looking at something that was clearly premeditated moneydriven and very well planned a very intelligent crime so fucking intelligent that were not even sure if its been committed or not is this murder is it extortion is it both or did the old boy give this woman all his money just because he liked her did he just run his bath too hot take a heart attack from the shock and drown in it we dont bloody know do we now that ruth mcconnells been taken out of the frame and our faith in the obvious has been destroyed we know hardly anything agreed said ds dell so what would your new hero skinner do in our shoes thats what ive been asking myself and then i remembered something he said when we were at the golf club he said hed look at the whole scene in a mirror what did he mean by that well so far weve been concentrating on whats missing from the house now we know but its taken us nowhere but instead of that what if theres something in the house that shouldnt be such as maybe well know when we find it maybe we wont but lets just have a look round with that objective in mind and maybe well find something that will give us a clue about what was in that big bag the woman was carrying is that likely dell asked doubtful once more we know that the old man was injected within a short time of his death itd be reasonable to assume that the woman did it but she was very careful to remove the syringe from the house exactly exclaimed mackenzie and as big bob skinner pointed out when we had our chat that was a major mistake like he said she should have chucked the thing in the bath wed just have assumed that the old autographs in the rain chap had shot himself up the woman could have been the avon lady going to the wrong address how dyou know about the avon lady she shot back at him my mother told me he opened the car door and stepped out into the rain come on lets get on with it the sergeant followed him up the path with the collar of her heavy coat turned up to protect her hair against the rain as much as possible then waited as he fumbled with the keys finally he swung the door open the house was cold with an unpleasant musty reek clinging to it dell shivered i dont like this place she said eh dyou think its haunted in a way i believe that evil clings to places and takes a long time to go away and i feel that something evil happened here he gave her a look that was a mix of scorn and cynicism thatll sound good in the witness box lets find some evidence in my experience that works better with juries ill take the bathroom and bedrooms you take the kitchen okay but what am i looking for look at not for look at everything and ask what its doing there if theres no good answer she did as he instructed and went into the kitchen she looked around it was neat and tidy with neither utensils cups nor saucers scattered around she began by opening the high fitted cupboards on the wall facing the door one contained only food in tins and packets the other was full of crockery and glassware she went from cupboard to cupboard drawer to drawer but saw nothing in any of them that would have been out of place in any kitchen finally she glanced along the work surfaces toaster microwave blender she said absently coming to a rack on the wall and flicking through its contents bills bookmark empty cassette box postcard she took it out and looked at it from ruth love from corfu nice thought on a day like this she left the kitchen and walked across the hall into the living room it was just as neat two chairs were placed on either side of the gas fire so that both looked at the television set in the corner redundant fire irons stood in the hearth a brass knight in armour with poker tongs shovel and brush as weapons alongside a rack held newspapers and magazines she looked around as ruth had done virtually the only other items left were the old mans hifi equipment and his small collection of vinyl records and cds all of it gathered together in a purposemade unit the system looked impressive if not new it was made up of carefully chosen separates like her own all except the turntable from the mission cyrus range she peered at it amplifier power amp cd player tuner systemdek turntable she paused and her eyes narrowed slightly she bent and looked at the recordings lined on their shelves twelveinch lps and compact discs straightening up she went back through to the kitchen and took the cassette box empty of tape or label from the rack dave she called stepping back into the hall have you come across a tape player through there the inspector emerged from the front bedroom no why she held up the box he didnt have a deck in his system either i was just wondering what this was doing here it was in the rack in the kitchen but ruth could have put it there i think she must have tidied up after you left her here the other day he took it from her and looked at it maybe well take it anyway it doesnt look as if its been dusted so we can always see if we can lift a print off it other than ruths the old mans and ours i dont know what itll tell us though his wicked smile flashed back here maybe she had a karaoke machine in that box maybe the old fella was hooked on that as well when a man is six feet four inches tall and is brought up in edinburgh there has always been a fair chance that at some time in his youth someone will persuade him to pack down in the back row of a scrum today when a woman is six feet four inches tall that fair chance becomes a certainty in jack mcgurks case most of his classmates in his year at the royal high school had been vertically disadvantaged and so in his penultimate year he had been pitched into the second row of the scrum and the middle of the lineout he had done well in schools rugby not because of any inborn technical skills but because his natural aptitude for violence in closequarter situations particularly those on the blind side of the referee quickly had earned him a reputation which had made most opponents back off unfortunately he had carried this trait with him into senior rugby his career had come to an end before his nineteenth birthday two seconds after he had squeezed the testicles of a twentysixyearold policeman and one time scotland b flanker named andrew martin in the middle of a ruck a trip to casualty a bad case of concussion and four lost teeth had been all that it had taken to make him realise that the game at that level was something entirely different and that he wanted no part of it mcgurk was fairly certain that ten years on there was little chance of the head of cid even if he remembered the incident and it had been a fairly powerful squeeze identifying him as the culprit as it happened he was wrong but martin was not a man to bear a grudge particularly since the referee having seen the provocation had been blind to the retaliation the detective sergeants jaw ached as he wandered into raeburn place the traditional home of edinburgh academicals rugby football club the very ground where his brief flirtation with the game had ended the second xv was the only side in action that afternoon pitted against jedforest seconds he had decided to go along to the match out of nothing more than t curiosity to see whether lander and his manager chum were any good at the game the rain was hammering down as he wandered into the ground under his golf umbrella and found shelter in the small grandstand the first half was almost over and already jed were fourteen points down he could see why at the first lineout when arthur symonds on his own hookers throw had the ball stripped from him easily by a smaller but more committed opponent look at that big lad a disgruntled jed supporter moaned in the general direction of mcgurk as the nearest available listener he looks like a fucking tree stood among all the rest of them but all he is is the fucking fairy on top accies scrumhalf used the unexpected good possession to feed his backs but the inside centre was tackled in open field by a determined form whom the detective recognised as glenn lander unfortunately the flanker missed an easy opportunity to turn his man and regain possession accies scrumhalf used the resulting ruck to reset his attack before spinning a long pass directly out to his left wing who crossed the line and ran behind the posts look at them roared the jed diehard beside mcgurk boys against men and the boys are still stuffing us had it not been for the incessant heavy rain which continued all through the match the policeman would have left at the halftime break instead he stayed under his shelter and watched the debacle until the end a further converted try soon after the restart put the result beyond any doubt and the home side seemed content to contain their opponents from that point on happily the referee exercised merciful common sense with almost twenty minutes left to noside he abandoned the meaningless match because of the deteriorating ground conditions thirty players and around the same number of spectators applauded his decision in evident relief and as a man headed directly for the pavilion and the sanctuary of the bar the tall detective who had come to the match by bus saw the sense of this approach as he hustled across the pitch avoiding like the rest the most churnedup areas he saw a man in a waxed cotton coat and matching flat cap walk over to glenn lander and speak to him the young estate owner his face a mask of mud turned as if to reply then caught sight of mcgurk at first it was impossible to read his expression beneath the camouflage autographs in the rain until he grinned said something to the other man and as he turned towards the exit headed in the direction of the policeman did you decide to follow us sergeant he asked just as they reached the pavilion he was still breathing heavily evidence that at least he had tried until the end nah i just got curious thats all i havent been to a club game since i chucked playing myself so i thought id come along to see what you boys were like lander gave a short breathless laugh as he folded his umbrella mcgurk glanced at him and noticed that blood was seeping from a slight cut beside his right eye mingling with the mud and whats the verdict the truth plain and unvarnished you asked for it you cover a fair bit of ground but you never seem to put your hands on the ball as for your big pal symonds your fucking trout can jump higher than him youd be better off at home looking after them sorry he added lander shook his head dont be our coach is going to say a bloody sight worse when he gets us in that dressing room i take your point about the fish really we should be back at howdengate trying to sort out restocking but if art and i had stayed at home at such short notice the team would have been light the club could have landed in hot water with therfu unlike your two and a half ton of trout which by now will be in very cold water frozen in fact mcgurk shook the young landowners hand then climbed the stairs to the pavilion only the smaller of the two bars was open and the lounge area was crowded he stood his brolly with the rest edged up to the bar secured a pint of lager and turned away to find andy and karen martin smiling at him the games much better watched from up here jack said the dcs i didnt know you were a member guest the sergeant replied whose he looked around yours probably thats all right then this club needs all the income it can get this social or professional i saw you speaking to one of the jed lads social really mr pringle and i saw him this morning him and that big useless secondrower of theirs he owns a trout farm and the big lads his manager youll never guess what happened to them last night martins vivid green eyes narrowed youre joking i wish i was sir but when it comes to security these boys just wont take a telling maybe not said martin quietly but you tell dan pringle from me that i want an action plan from him at monday mornings divisional heads meeting three strikes and someones out he sipped his orange juice then shot the other man a curious look funny jack when i saw you there i wondered if you were considering a comeback v at that moment the sergeant knew that he knew i wont if you wont sir he answered my days are long gone he chuckled do you reckon i did you a favour then mcgurk switched his pint to his left hand put two fingers into his mouth and withdrew a dental plate with four upper molars i didnt think so at the time sir he said but ive still got a few of my own teeth left so with hindsight i reckon you did bandit mackenzie slid a plate of four chocolate doughnuts across his desk get outside a couple of these he said one maybe my diets working dell picked one up and dunked it in her coffee youre splashing out arent you i thought i should in the circs what circs he looked at her awkwardly even a little guiltily well its like this he began if wed got a result this afternoon out of our wee bit of private enterprise id have been able to square your overtime with the dci no problem but i doubt if ill be able to persuade him that an empty cassette box counts as a result not unless it turns out to have bible johns dna on it she laughed ironically how does your wife put up with you dave youre the slipperiest bastard i know one of your saving graces is that youre also the most transparent i never had any illusions about being on double time this afternoon she grabbed a second doughnut and popped it into a brown paper bag which lay on the desk so ill have this for later he grinned still beats the st enoch centre on a saturday though doesnt it i wouldnt know she answered im a reasonably affluent single woman i prefer princes square mackenzie laughed its just as well i dont fancy you youre way too pricey for me she wrinkled her nose and flashed her eyes at him of course you fancy me but your other saving grace is that you love your wife youre too fucking sharp by half girl you could wind up on point duty somewhere if youre not careful he reached into a side pocket of his jacket for the cassette box here stick a label on this and get it to a technician on monday but the container he laid on the desk held a tape the recording of his interrogation of ruth mcconnell earlier in the week shit wrong pocket he reached down to the other side found the box which they had taken from john mcconnells kitchen and laid it on the desk beside the other here wait a minute he sat upright eyes narrowing theyre different sizes the sergeant leaned forward peering at the desk she took the tape from its box and tried to fit it into the other it was too wide by a few millimetres then what the hell is it she asked ill tell you mackenzie said quietly its a video eight cassette box and old john mcconnell didnt have a camcorder gwennie that big awkward bag your witness saw the woman carry into the house a pound to a pinch of shit there was a video camera in it the bitch was filming him she looked at him in disbelief but why in heavens name would she want to do that heavens got nothing to do with this he leaned back in his chair once more yes sergeant your overtime is safe with me the dci will okay it for sure when i report this to him who knows he might even okay some for me he smiled til report it somewhere else too im looking forward to hearing what bob skinner makes of this i suppose i should thank you mcgurk dan pringle growled into the telephone although it might have occurred to you that it was down to me to break the bad news to the head of cid that my divisions on the way to becoming a laughing stock i tried to call him this afternoon i was going to give it another shot tonight im sorry gaffer honest i couldnt have known that dcs martin would be there far less that hed see me talking to lander from the clubhouse bar but when he did i had no bloody choice but to tell him pringle sighed aye i know son im just a bit pissed off thats all and youre in line three strikes and someones out indeed our andy is not known for his sense of humour either not when it comes to the job at any rate so wed better take him at his word and have an action plan in place for monday the sergeants heart sagged at the use of the plural he knew what was coming next did you have plans for tomorrow well yes sir aye well so had i were both stuffed then you said there are two other substantial fish farms on our patch didnt you thats right in berwickshire just north of coldstream and down near langholm in that case i want you to arrange for the owners of them both to meet the two of us on site tomorrow whether they like it or not if our weekends buggered sos theirs autographs in the rain when sammy pye answered the phone once more in ruth mcconnells flat bob skinner needed no further confirmation that his secretarys private life had taken a new turn he smiled he wondered what the young sergeant would make of her over the longterm he was still grinning when she came on the line then he remembered why he was calling her ruthie he began your pal mackenzies out to impress all of a sudden hes been back to your uncles house for another look around i hope he didnt turn it upside down she snorted it took me long enough to tidy the place up when he left me there the other day im sure he didnt he and his sergeant may have found something though theres just something he needs to check with you first and i said id do it for him its about your uncle john and his missing possessions can you tell me whether or not he ever owned a video camcorder specifically a nondigital model the sort that takes eightmillimetre cassettes he waited but only for a few seconds no sir she said vehemently im quite sure that he didnt apart from his music stuff uncle john wasnt a man for toys like that why he didnt even have a video recorder far less a camera youre absolutely sure of that are you couldnt he maybe have bought a camera in the last few months of his life one that you didnt know about absolutely not sir he wouldnt have done that and there was a good reason why not i offered to buy him one for christmas a few years back he told me not to he said that one of the great regrets of his life was that he didnt have any cine film or video of aunt cecily not a scrap she had wanted him to buy a camcorder but he had always refused he said he thought the things were intrusive they annoyed him whenever he saw them in holiday resorts and there was no way he wanted to be taken for a german then my aunt died and he realised what he had denied himself but after refusing her one he just couldnt contemplate buying one for himself or letting me either no sir no way okay he said possibility discounted that gives inspector mackenzie something to go on thanks he was about to hang up but added by the way whose turn is it for the dishes tonight he left her laughing then called bandit mackenzie on his mobile number your box means something inspector he told him ruthies dead certain that her uncle never owned a camera what does it mean though sir i hate to think i saw a home movie earlier this year and i never wanted to see its like again i only hope any advice there was a silence think for yourself bandit skinner said finally why would she do it well need to find her to learn that i suppose maybe has she done it before now youre cooking so so ill run a check through the central criminal intelligence unit for other suspicious deaths involving single old people with drug problems why just old people that makes it difficult who said it was going to be easy you do that ill have a look in my hat see if i can find another rabbit autographs in the rain the big darkhaired solicitor looked merely nonplussed when the very recognisable figure of the deputy chief constable stepped into the living room of the house just off craiglockhart avenue when louise bankier followed him a few moments later his expression turned to one of pure bewilderment he looked at neil mcllhenney im sorry mr stanley said the big detective answering his unspoken accusation i had to be a wee bit circumspect when you showed me round yesterday he glanced at skinner all i told mr stanley was that we were looking for discreet accommodation for a vip visitor to edinburgh i kept miss bankiers name out of it just in case nothing came of it naturally the dcc continued picking up the explanation if you read the evening news yesterday and a few other papers today you may have seen a reference to ms bankier being in town these stories are to say the least unwelcome keith stanley had recovered his composure i can imagine he exclaimed skinner thought he caught an assumption behind his remark til tell you keith what i told the media ms bankier and i are old friends shes also a public figure who is going to be working in edinburgh for a while and wishes to maintain a semblance of a private life rather than be incarcerated in an hotel shes asked me as a friend if i would help her find somewhere suitable you might think that this house comfortable as it is seems a little modest for one of the worlds leading film actors if you did youd be right thats exactly why were here theres an estate for rent out beside dalmahoy louise could move in there but it would be like running up a flag it would be just the sort of place where the press would expect to find her this on the other hand is an ordinary house in an ordinary suburb just like ms bankiers family home near glasgow in fact where people mind their own business and do not observe their neighbours coming and going i cant think of anywhere in edinburgh where someone would be less likely to pick up the phone and tip off the tabloids that she was here to back that up of course if you rent this house to ms bankier we will expect your client and your firm to be bound by the normal rules of confidentiality of course the solicitor exclaimed but even at that ms bankiers a very famous lady and as we all know this is a surprisingly small town sure agreed skinner but if through no ones fault it does leak and the paparazzi turn up here theyll stand out like a sore thumb and theyll be moved on like any other loiterers now would you like to show louise around keith stanley nodded of course he looked at the woman well he began with a smile this is the living room skinner and mcllhenney remained behind as agent and potential tenant left the room there you are the dcc muttered the word stalker was never mentioned you dont think we should tell him big keiths a professional if he asks ill tell him if not thats his judgement this was a good spot though neil nice house and like you said a piece of piss to protect the film production company will pay a premium rent and a good security deposit if lou likes it once weve gone you talk to keith about the things we need to do for security dont go into too much detail but you can tell him that we want to install automatic openers to the driveway gate and garage door the garage is attached to the house with a steel connecting door so that way you can drive straight in and lou can go in without ever being in the open air tell keith that well leave the auto openers for his clients when the lease expires as an added sweetener not that hell need it i saw the glint of money in his eye lets get everything done as quickly as we can i want lou in here by tuesday l i autographs in the rain looking across the table maggie rose thought that dan pringle looked a little flustered that struck her as unusual she had seen pringle happy sad angry and hungover but never flustered she wondered whether after all the country air was proving too fresh for her veteran colleague and whether sooner rather than later andy martin might suggest moving her to the borders and him back to edinburgh then it came pringles turn to report and she understood another fish hijacking dan willie michaels exclaimed only to have the smile wiped from his lips by a single glower you can bloody laugh came the growl ive seen the figures on pilferage of electrical goods from the factories in your area so have i said the head of cid from the head of the table dont worry thats next on the agenda carry on dan pringle shot another arrowlike glance at his west lothian colleague very good sir he said like i said last week the danger has existed for a while theres a cavalier attitude among some of these fish farmers they think that insuring against theft is the only precaution worth taking the first thing i want to do sir and here id welcome your involvement is to speak to the major insurers and draw their attention to whats happened i want them all to review their cover for these farms at once wherever they are and to put the wind up the operators with big premium increases for those who dont follow police security advice til do that dan martin agreed and going by past experience theyll agree to that suggestion the only problem is that itll take them upwards of a week to agree and longer than that to implement weve had two thefts in a week what can we do in the short term to prevent another pringles heavy eyebrows came together as he tugged at a corner of his moustache the best we can sir given our manpower resources given the cost of this scale of operation i reckon that there are two other borders trout farms that are worth doing what are the costs dan asked maggie rose two vehicles four guys somewhere to kill it quick and freeze it quicker and the take thats the thing mags the estimate is that a total of seven tons has been stolen thats about sixteen thousand pounds of trout im told that if you sell it fresh to the big stores depending on the market you might get one fifty a pound for it frozen youll get less if you process it either smoke it or turn it into pate youll get more but these boys are unlikely to have done that so even if theyve managed to find a gullible market that would take it all fresh their top take will have been twentyfour grand knock off expenses and split it four ways and its no a hell of a lot to risk the jail for so im expecting another theft somewhere maybe not on my patch but somewhere okay said martin well alert every farm in britain and well use the information to stir up the insurers as well but what about the two other farms on your patch mcgurk and i visited them yesterday replied pringle theres langholm rainbow farm and country fresh trout near coldstream langholms the biggest of the lot but anyone that does it is asking for it the owner a man called stephenson has highdefinition video cameras on high poles and he floodlights the place at night plus the sites surrounded by an alarmed fence he smokes or processes most of his fish on site so hes at the top end of profitability he assured us that hes never compromised with security the other one country fresh is run by a woman her names mercy alvarez she and her husband started the place then she divorced him and got it as part of her settlement did you say mercy greg jay looked down the table short for mercedes maggie rose explained its a popular spanish girls name t could imagine this one being popular said pringle shes a real looker just like youd imagine a senora dark eyes long dark hair fine dan martin interrupted but whats her security like crap same as mellerkirk and howdengate an onsite manager and no perimeter alarms no alarms at all in fact she did say that shed install video surveillance though did you believe her to be frank no i didnt she struck me as apathetic about the whole business she was a bit aggressive in fact still mcgurk left her details of insuranceapproved installers tell him to go back in a couple of days and see if shes done anything about it i might just give her some encouragement myself okay but i had another thought whats that why dont we install our own why should we let her pay for it and if she wont let her insurance company shove her premium skyhigh i didnt mean install it for her i meant install our own setup on the qt theres a wee woodland overlooking the farm we could stick a night vision video camera in there with a timer and a longlife battery martin rubbed the back of his hand against his chin as he considered the superintendents suggestion would the tapes last long enough set up two cameras with two timers well change the tapes and batteries first light every morning costly mind wed need high quality kit divert it from the crime prevention budget pringle suggested itll be money spent better than on telly commercials the head of cid laughed the boss would agree with you there okay dan go ahead youll tell the owner of course ach why should i shed never install her own if i did that no but as soon as this meetings over ill talk to the telecommunications people fine martin turned to detective superintendent michaels right willie about this pilferage epidemic of yours glenys algodon looked around the living room not even moderately impressed its all right the secretary said in a slightly transatlantic accent but when you compare it to the house the studio rented for you in sri lanka on the last gig or even your own place in beverly hills i mean look how close the neighbours are neil mcllhenney felt his hackles rise the woman had treated him like a taxidriver when he had collected her from her shuttle flight at edinburgh airport now here she was criticising the accommodation that he had picked out louise bankier defused the bomb inside him with a simple laugh compared to your flat in london or mine for that matter were luxuriating in space here she said what about the south african movie last year when they wouldnt let us leave the hotel or that place off malaysia where we did the location shots for that awful scifi epic you and i and the makeup girl had to share a room and the toilets she turned grinning to the big detective moving across towards him french style they were and the shower head was directly above you plus there was no hot water on the island and the cold was in short supply so you had to she stopped herself short blushing slightly and laid the flat of her hand on his chest still laughing believe me neil this house is lovely just lovely plus as bob said yesterday its just like my mum and dads place in bearsden his anger was completely forgotten dissolved by the music of her laughter and the warmth of her touch he looked from her to glenys algodon she was smiling too at the malaysian memory but he noticed that she did not blush she was almost as tall as her employer with copper coloured hair that at first he had assumed was dyed until he saw that her skin tone was a very light brown indicating a mix of ethnic origin a west indian grandparent perhaps or a mauritian i suppose so she conceded but do you really want clarence here at weekends i dont mind at all said louise if you dont and if neils happy glenyss frown returned neils in charge of my security the actress explained hes a policeman like his colleague she nodded towards a second man in the room standing quietly beside the window excuse me boss lady the secretary exclaimed but whats this about when we talked about this project at first you said that you might stay in glasgow with your father and your sister now here you are holed up in a bungalow in the sticks of edinburgh surrounded by coppers louise looked up at the big inspector neil she asked quietly do you want to explain sure lets all sit down though no you go ahead ill make us all some coffee i noticed that someones done some shopping for us as she spoke the doorbell rang mcllhenney went to the front door and opened it a woman stood in the small porch she could have been louise bankier in her twenties hi she said with a smile you must be inspector neil im lucy lous sister come on in the detective swung the door wide she told me you were coming through to see her he led the younger bankier into the living room taking her coat from her on the way and hanging it on a hook in the hall the reunited sisters embraced good to see you luce louise exclaimed you pitched up at just the right moment as usual im just about to make coffee come with me theres stuff ive got to tell you the two women headed for the kitchen leaving the policemen alone with the secretary okay said glenys sharply as soon as the door had closed what is this i didnt introduce myself properly at the airport he began my name is detective inspector neil mcllhenney im the executive assistant to detective chief constable bob skinner we have reason to believe no bullshit the woman snapped plain talk please okay said mcllhenney lous got a stalker someone set off a smoke bomb in her hotel room early saturday morning put her in hospital for a few hours a week before that she was in regent street with my boss whos an old friend of hers some bastard in a car white male dark ford mondeo fired a shotgun at them it was a blank but dcc skinner didnt autographs in the rain know that at the time hes made a few enemies so he assumed at first that it was the real thing and that he was the target now were assuming that ms bankier was as long as shes working in edinburgh shes under our protection effectively ill be her bodyguard you mean living with us no but ill be very close my house is a few hundred yards away and weve installed an alarm system thats linked to there and to the nearest police station weve got some toys in the garden as well thatll pick up anything heavier than a cat as soon as he steps over the fence she looked at him your wifes gonna love that my wife is dead he answered coldly she flicked an apologetic glance at him then looked down hey im sorry so am i mcllhenney nodded across to the other younger man this is detective sergeant stevie steele hes been detached from other duties to the investigative side of this thing and hell report directly to dcs martin our head of cid and through him to dcc skinner first off hes going to need to talk to you sure said glenys all her earlier suspicion and aggression had vanished leaving only concern inspector she asked you said that your boss is an old friend of louise how old they were students together ah i wonder maybe its him she smiled at mcllhenney louise has had a few male involvements in her life she explained warren judd was the most serious but thats over a while now yet ive known for almost as long as ive worked for her that there was someone way back someone who left a mark on her that aint never worn off i dont want to get too corny but ive always thought of him as the love of her life friday before last she told me that she was meeting someone for dinner she didnt say who but from the way she said it and the way she looked real nervous unlike ive ever seen her i knew that it was him i got to get a look at this guy mcllhenney turned to steele stevie he murmured youd do well to forget you ever heard any of that and you too ms algodon thats a part of louises life that youd better keep very confidential now he snapped suddenly sergeant sure ms algodon glenys glenys then i know already from the metropolitan police that youve reported a couple of people to them as shall i say unwelcome correspondents they were both interviewed immediately and they were both found to be innocent just fans who had taken adulation a bit too far very quietly weve confirmed already that neither of these men was in edinburgh on friday night one of them is dead and the other is a recluse who conducts almost his entire life over the internet ican you recall what alarmed you about them she shrugged they were persistent thats all i thought they were possibly obsessive personalities so i took no chances youre qualified to judge of course said steele casually having a degree in psychology how did you know that she shot back same way we know that your boyfriend clarence sparrow is a solicitor and a west ham season ticket holder we take our job seriously glenys im sure you do too i appreciate your ability to make sound judgements about ms bankiers correspondence can you tell me how you base these first of all what volume of mail does she receive probably less than youd think the secretary told him louise has a mature following and the older you get the less likelier you are to write fan mail these days more and more of it comes over the internet louise has a website and theres an email address attached there is an official fan club and we receive mail through that also there are people who just write to louise bankier london or great britain even and these are passed on by the post office do you get much crank stuff very little most people just write to thank louise for a particular movie or for being like a friend to them they aint even looking for a reply usually but they always get one sometimes with a photograph and its always signed personally and with a little ps message she even insists on signing off her own email even if i draft it i have her signature programmed in and we can add it when i get nasty ones as i do very occasionally i never show them to her i send them a stern reply signed by me warning them off if necessary i dont burn them or shred them though i keep them for at least two years in case theres a repeat from the same source autographs in the rain almost invariably theyre signed too with return addresses when they come in the mail i always check them out and the addresses are always genuine when they come in the email i pass them back to the provider for them to deal with have you had any nasty ones lately only one or two in the last six months we dont get all that many and as i said they were all signed and addressed theyre in a file at the agency in london where im usually based fine steele nodded i can have them checked out what about your internet correspondence some but not much netheads are too scared of being blocked out she paused there was one message though a couple of months back that i didnt show to lou it came on hotmail it was unsigned and odd enough for me to check it out with microsoft all they could tell me was that the holder of that mailbox was someone called john steed and that he had logged on and registered through a cyber cafe in newcastle give me two minutes to boot up my laptop and ill show you it she picked up a bag which she had laid on a chair unzipped it and produced a portable computer clipped into the lid beneath a transparent screen was a photograph of a smiling black man the detectives waited as she switched it on and opened her email folders she had just clicked on a file and handed the computer to steele when the bankier sisters came back into the room lucy wore a worried look louise followed behind her carrying four china cups and saucers on a tray she laid one beside the sergeant on a small table as he looked at the message with mcllhenney peering over his shoulder hi louise they read silently this is a message to thank you for the major contribution you have made to world cinema during your outstanding career however every bitch has its day as they say and its in the nature of things that yours has to be over quite soon when that time comes i hope that you will have a moment to contemplate the effect that you have had on the lives of the millions to whom you have provided an idle distraction and that you will be able to judge at that time whether the sacrifices you have made along the way have been worth it after all john steed what is it louise asked an email i didnt show you glenys confessed ah one of them you know the secretary exclaimed of course i do louise laughed not even an actress is vain enough to assume that she only gets nice mail she held out a hand to steele lets see it the sergeant glanced at mcllhenney who nodded grimfaced she took the laptop from him and read you see what i mean the secretary said when she was finished its odd but you couldnt call it threatening neil mcllhenney and louise bankier exchanged meaningful glances until you see the signature said the detective he looked at the others you three are probably too young to remember the tv series and no bugger went to the movie they made a few years back the name john steed that was the name of the lead character the series was called the avengers bob skinner was rarely surprised but even he was taken aback when ruth buzzed through to his office to say that detective inspector david mackenzie was at the front desk asking if he might see him the bandit the dcc exclaimed i wonder what the hell he wants aye sure ill see him have someone show him the way up when ruth showed the lanarkshire detective into the big woodpanelled office she recalled his mockery of her boss at their first unfortunate meeting somewhere along the line she mused as she saw the expression on his face he has learned respect well david said skinner as she left does your mother know youre out he grinned at the younger mans momentary confusion i mean does your divisional commander know that youre through here ive told detective superintendent lillie that i had to come through to edinburgh to pursue my enquiries sir he frowned how did you know shes a woman youd be amazed by what i know for example youre an albion rovers supporter the inspectors mouth fell open dont be embarrassed about it son skinner laughed its the main reason why i like you tell me though did you tell the lady whom you were coming to see mackenzie gave a slight awkward grin not exactly shed have gutted me like a fish if id told her that i said i had to reinterview a witness but what if i hadnt been in didnt you think to call first i suppose i should have but the thing is it isnt really you ive come to see i want another chat with ruth not under caution this time i hope no of course not she isnt back on the list so far ive drawn a blank with my check on drugsrelated deaths the fatalities are nearly all on smack and most of them found in derelict buildings not drowned in their baths no i need ruths help again thats all lets see if she can then skinner leaned forward picked up one of his telephones and buzzed twice less than half a minute later the door opened christ ruthie he murmured were you waiting outside more or less sir mr chase was in my office with about a days worth of dictation i just excused myself and ran skinner scowled i must tell acc chase that anything he dictates over the weekend will have to be typed up by jack good youve got your work cut out as it is looking after the two of us five days a week its part of his game plan sir he wants a secretary of his own he can have one skinner retorted but good goes back to traffic thats the deal and ill tell him too he turned to mackenzie sorry david were washing linen here now how can ruth help you i want to take this investigation off on another tack sir i sat down yesterday and i reviewed everything we know about this death there are questions all over the place the drugs in the old mans system the missing syringe that was used to inject him the identity of the woman the video camera what happened to all his possessions and his money then it came to me that theres another gap in our knowledge one that we can fill we know very little about the victim himself we know that his only two living relatives were ruths mother his sisterinlaw and ruth herself we know that he was a member of dullatur golf club for about sixty years till he stopped playing we know that he was a british rail manager in glasgow until his retirement but thats it and its all completely impersonal it gives me no clue to what this man was like and i should know that so ruth he looked at her directly for the first time id be grateful if you would tell me about your uncle what sort of man was he she stared back at him as if she was slightly puzzled by his question what was he like yes for example was he your favourite uncle inspector he was my only uncle my late father had one brother and no sisters and my mother is an only child i see i knew you were his only niece but i didnt realise that it doesnt really answer the spirit of my question though ruth caught his shrewd look would he have been my favourite uncle if he had competition you mean no probably not why not she sucked in her breath i find it hard to say i went to see him out of family duty as much as anything else the fact that i hadnt seen him for autographs in the rain months before his death should tell you something i may have felt guilty if i hadnt phoned him for a while but i didnt do anything about it he could be a very remote man not cold just remote for example i dont recall my father ever telling any funny stories about him my dad had a great sense of humour he loved people yet he never had anything to say about uncle john even about their childhood and there was less than two years between them in age dad was the older he and aunt cecily didnt visit us very often and we rarely visited them when we did meet it was always very formal i never remember much chat later when i got a bit older i used to duck out of even those occasional visits suddenly she frowned for a while i didnt feel comfortable with uncle john why asked mackenzie quietly there was this one time she murmured id be about thirteen and my mum and dad had a party for my dads sixtyfifth birthday and his retirement he was head teacher in a big secondary in kilmarnock uncle john and aunt cecily were invited i remember my mum being surprised when they came well as i said i was about thirteen i was shall we say a big girl for my age but i was still short of any sexual awakening i didnt have a clue about any of that stuff nothing to go on save tweeny chitchat nevertheless i was wearing a very short skirt and a stickup bra because i thought they were fashionable and my good old mum had indulged me shes about twenty years younger than my dad he was midforties when they met he was married before she added in explanation but his first wife left him for a bloke in glasgow anyway there was music at the party i had a dance with my dad and then my uncle john asked me to dance with him it wasnt the same as dancing with my dad i can tell you thinking about it now i remember it quite clearly are you saying he touched you asked mackenzie no she said quickly nowhere he shouldnt not in the way i think you mean anyway no there was a slow tune playing and he danced fairly close he was leaning over me then he gave me a hug and i felt this enormous hard thing pressed against my abdomen it was just for a second or two until the record stopped i wasnt scared i suppose i was taken aback more than anything else i suppose that even then i must have known something about male equipment but it took a conversation with a school pal to tell me that dear uncle john had had a monster erection for his little niece looking back now i have no doubt that he was letting me know it deliberately what did you do nothing but i knew that i didnt want to dance with him again even after i found out for sure that he hadnt had a stick of rock shoved down his trousers i didnt say anything to my mum or dad the terrible thing is that a young girl in that position is afraid that if she does tell tales shell be accused of making them up but i was very wary of uncle john for a while after that in fact for about five years until i was how do i say not sexually experienced but sexually confident i probably made a point subconsciously of never being alone with him as she looked at the inspector her eyes seemed to harden there you are bandit she said theres an insight into my uncle the victim he was an old lecher at first mackenzie gazed back at her as if he could think of nothing to say i wish that was the first time id heard a story like that he murmured at last but i saw the same thing actually happen to a kid once at a family party just like you she screamed though and i nailed the guy who did it there and then i charged him with indecent assault that was the time i told you about the time i nicked my own brother for the second time that afternoon bob skinners eyebrows rose in surprise have you spoken to ruths mother yet he asked quickly no sir the strathclyde detective answered you should said ruth maybe he tried it on with her as well neil mcllhenney looked at the three beautiful women who sat in a circle facing him stevie steele had gone taking with him a printout of john steeds enigmatic message its easier for me to give this advice than it will be for you to take it he said but i dont want you to get this thing out of proportion this bloke has made two extravagant gestures so far unpleasant stunts they were but stupid too because they were both very risky for example central london is patrolled by armed response teams if one of them had been in the area when he fired that shotgun it could have backfired on him fatally weve also found a security tape in the balmoral which may show a man flipping a room key behind the reception counter the suspects back is to the camera but it was still a reckless thing to do if there is a next time the inspector muttered grimly hes cooked that said he added quickly hes not going to do it here no one will break into this house i promise you that you believe me glenys algodons eyes dropped to her lap even louise looked hesitant for a moment of course she said not quite quickly enough listen lou said neil if it makes you feel safer i will have an armed woman officer stationed permanently with you thanks but no really i have faith in you im still just a bit shaken by what happened the other night thats all he smiled at her t dont blame you but its going to be all right honest inspector can i ask you something lucy bankiers question interrupted their exchange fire away he said what about our house in bearsden i mean is it conceivable that this man could try something there dads quite frail these days and i wouldnt want to worry him with any of this but if theres a chance lucy he told her right now your house in bearsden is being watched by special branch officers as my boss said earlier this sort of incident is being regarded as a form of terrorism these days and handled appropriately im not sb but ive been given this role for a variety of reasons the best being that this is how mr skinner wants it otherwise my colleague mario mcguire or one of his team would be here he chuckled tm better looking than mcguire anyway be sure lucy it would be just as dangerous for anyone to attack your house in glasgow as it would be to try anything here thats good to know sighed the younger bankier sister sincerely one thing though where did you leave your car i assume that you drove through yes its in the street thats fine for today but in future when youre through here park it in the driveway of the house mcllhenney rose from his chair okay louise he said tm off hopefully you can get on with learning that script with no interruptions she stood with him and walked him to the door oh yes he added there may be one the big man will probably look in on you before he goes home my other jailer she murmured with a smile im sorry if it feels like that but its for my own good yes sir i know but still i am this mans prisoner effectively no youre not he assured her you can go where you like when you like with me okay she shot back still smiling take me to a movie tomorrow night any damned movie he hesitated in the dark among people whod recognise you hey she protested im not hiding from the world at large just from one man and hes not going to try anything in a crowd with you around the worst thatll happen is that youll have to watch me sign a few autographs she broke off picked up what looked like a piece of card from the hall table and handed it to him that reminds me i promised you this he turned it over it was a photograph signed for neil lauren and spencer with love lou hey thanks he exclaimed almost bashfully okay tell you what he glanced at her enquiringly hows your schedule tomorrow autographs in the rain i read in the morning then i have a production meeting here in the afternoon with warren judd and elliott silver im executive producer on this project as well its part of the deal well he said suddenly tentative once thats done would you like to have supper with the kids and me after that you and i can go on to a movie somewhere discreet you understand she smiled it seemed to light up the narrow hall hey id love it i enjoy nothing more than just behaving like an ordinary human being until youve lived in a goldfish bowl like mine you cant know how precious that is sure i can he murmured she looked at him but came nowhere close to reading his thoughts sure i can dan pringles description had been spot on andy martin acknowledged as he stepped out of his sports car after a bumpy journey up the sort of country track for which it had decidedly not been designed despite his discomfort he was glad that he had come he was intrigued by the superintendents investigation but had felt remote from it as was the case with bob skinner the ties of his supervisory role chafed him from time to time and occasionally he felt compelled to loosen them albeit less frequently than his friend and commander as he started to walk towards the woman she turned in his direction mercedes alvarez would have stood out in any crowd she was he guessed in her midthirties and looked as stereotypically spanish as anyone he had ever seen with jetblack hair and sparkling brown eyes which seemed to burn like coals as she glared at her unexpected visitor yes she demanded aggressively as they approached each other you cant read the sign maybe the one on the gate which says that this place is not open to the public yes i read it ms alvarez the detective chief superintendent replied but i dont qualify as the public im a policeman he introduced himself but she was unmollified another policeman she protested two of you came to see me yesterday they even asked me to meet them here wasnt that enough apparently not they reported to me that you seemed less than interested in what they had to say no thats not so of course i am interested in my fish of course i am sorry for what happened to those two other farmers whoever they are im glad to hear it in that case i assume that youll follow their advice and install the security equipment that they recommended he sensed her move on to the defensive for the first time til look into it she said dismissively til have to see what it costs maybe i cant afford it autographs in the rain martin glanced around the big site listening to the noise of the pumps and the music of the running water which flowed constantly through the big tanks you cant afford not to ms alvarez if you want to be able to insure your stock in the future youre going to have to invest in alarms and a proper video system who says i say we say the police who are expending considerable time and money investigating the consequences of other farmers too shortsighted to invest in proper protection against theft we say youll have to and you can be dead certain that the insurance companies will back us up the woman flared up again her latin eyes flashing you cant threaten me like that martin grinned at her amused by her reaction sure i can he told her i can back it up too dont make me have to install that equipment she seemed to capitulate finally she smiled at him okay okay she exclaimed raising her hands in token of defeat til need to speak to mr john my bank manager maybe its really him who runs this place but ill do it is that andrew john the detective asked yes his office is in edinburgh but he comes to see me down here i know andrew ill speak to him tell him what the situation is i shouldnt think there will be a problem the smile left her face in an instant no she snapped you no do that thats my business ill deal with it okay then but you make sure you do im going to send detective sergeant mcgurk back here on friday ill expect you to show him a functioning video setup if you say so she grumbled but i have an alarm i have a video system kath she called to another younger woman who was loading feed into a dispenser she stopped laid down the big paper sack and walked towards them a big stronglooking girl in the inevitable black rubber boots this is kath adey said the spanish farmer shes my manager and she lives here she pointed to a cottage on the far side of the tank complex she sees everything and she has a loud voice to shout help if she needs to dont you kath sure do mercy you want to hear she asked the policeman ill take your word for it have you got plenty of groceries in that cottage the manager frowned i need milk but otherwise im okay why because if youre the only alarm system this place has for now you cannot leave it until proper equipment is installed and running whatever happens suppose you have an emergency call telling you that your grannys house is on fire and shes stuck on the roof you do not leave that stock unguarded clear the woman frowned at him and nodded clear do you have the number of the police station in coldstream its in the book isnt it look it up keep it handy just in case im not saying that anything will happen but still itd be nice if you and ms alvarez could get these fish to market rather than have someone else do it he looked back at the spanish owner friday remember she sighed okay friday you send your man back on friday he gave her a friendly smile and made to turn back towards his car hell be here he said count on it he drove carefully back down the rough track turning at last on to a road which led to and through the border town of coldstream as soon as he was in open country he eased his speed and dialled the central number of the bank of scotland he had to speak to two successive switchboard operators human screens between bank managers and an admiring public before finally he was put through to andrew johns office im sorry mr martin the bankers secretary told him but mr johns out of the office until thursday he has a series of meetings in england too bad i need to talk to him about one of his clients make me an appointment first thing on thursday ill come to him q age for age naomi mcconnell was as attractive as her daughter from ruths disclosure of the age difference between her parents david mackenzie knew that she was in her early sixties but she could have passed for ten years younger he found it hard to believe that she had been retired from teaching for two years this is very distressing she said as she ushered the policeman into the sitting room of her neat bungalow on the outskirts of the seaside town of ayr in common with most glaswegians he had been taken there by his parents as a boy in common with many he had not been back since for all that he was eighty i was really shocked when i heard that he was dead with all that golf he played he always struck me as such a fit man that i thought hed go on for ever now to learn that there was something suspicious about it ruth told me that someone drowned him in his bath she exclaimed we dont know that for sure mrs mcconnell the policeman cautioned its a possibility but itll probably never be any more than that there were no signs offeree on the body when we found it we do believe that he was drugged though drugged she looked and sounded astonished we suspect that he may have been taking tranquillisers or possibly having these administered to him my god what sort of a world is this or what sort of a world was he living in thats exactly what we have to find out thats why im here to ask you what you knew of your brotherinlaw ruths mother drew herself up in her chair as much as i wanted to and that wasnt much i hope im not incriminating myself here but i never liked john mcconnell the last time i saw him was at maxs funeral my husbands funeral five years ago since then weve exchanged christmas cards but thats been it autographs in the rain why did you dislike him mackenzie asked i dont know for sure but it was instant i can tell you that there was something creepy about him i remember the way he looked at me this first time we met and a few times after when i caught him off guard i felt as if he was sizing me up tm sorry to be blunt but do you mean sexually thats exactly what i mean i felt as if the man was undressing me with his eyes what about his wife he asked what was she like cecily naomi mcconnell threw back her head in a gesture which david mackenzie had seen in her daughter i never knew whether to feel sorry for him or for her in the end i suppose i felt sorry for them both they endured a sad barren marriage for almost forty years and they always seemed bored in each others company max and i visited them as a duty rather than a pleasure and entertained them on the same basis the detective looked at her did mr mcconnells attentions to you ever go beyond glances he asked cautiously she drew in her breath well i learned early on never to dance with him she snorted with remembered indignation in fact i remember once oh nearly twenty years ago at a party we had here when max retired i saw him dancing with ruth she was barely in her teens then but she was a well developed girl i probably let her overdress a bit that night she was gorgeous and didnt even know it anyway as i said i saw john dancing with her and i just wasnt having it so i walked over to the record player and stopped the music he looked at me afterwards and it was the only guilty look i ever had from him i thought about asking ruth if anything anything untoward had happened but she didnt seem flustered so i let it lie your suspicions were spot on though mackenzie blurted the words out in spite of himself you mean he nodded ruth told me exactly the same story yesterday in the circumstances and given her age she seems to have handled it pretty well tell me he continued quickly how did your husband feel about his brother max tolerated john but they were never close by any stretch of the imagination no there was something between them he never said so outright and i never asked him but i think that he either suspected or knew that john had had an affair with lorna his first wife mind you to listen to max talk about her youd think shed had everything in trousers he was very hurt when she left him and he stayed bitter about her for the rest of his life she went off with a man john worked beside in fact max held a bit of a grudge over that too she paused now he did feel sorry for cecily he thought it was sad that such an obviously asexual woman like her should be married to a man like him i asked him once why theyd married in the first place all he said was respectability he believed that his brother was promiscuous he even said to me that he thought he probably cruised the red light district of glasgow in that big car of his so all in all mrs mcconnell you did not regard your brotherinlaw as a very nice man the detective summed up not a bit she agreed he was mean too as tight as a fishs max used to say she laughed and yet in the last few months of his life he gave away all his money and virtually all of his possessions of value everything apart from his naomi gasped ruth didnt tell me that if thats the case i can only suppose that the old fool compromised himself with a woman in some way and that she blackmailed him maybe bandit mackenzie murmured but if she was blackmailing him why did she take a video camera into his house on the day he died thats the biggest mystery of all they looked at each other across the room you said that your husbands first wife went off with a workmate of his brother colleague mrs mcconnell laughed john was management and never slow to let you know it he didnt have workmates but yes lorna went off with a colleague i never knew his name though and max never mentioned it perhaps john kept in touch with her quite possibly but she cant tell you anything now she died about fifteen years ago i remember john phoning to tell max about it to see if he wanted to go to her funeral as far as i know he didnt even send flowers damn said the policeman his frustration showing another closed door i tell you mrs mcconnell your brotherinlaw couldnt have covered his tracks better if hed tried way back when the world was young and james proud was merely an assistant chief constable he met a young cid officer whose vision commitment and intensity were such that he made a bigger impression on him than any man had ever done before he had marked that young man as one who some day would command the force and from that time on had taken a personal interest in his career development bob skinner had known nothing of this at the time he had been totally focused on his twin ambitions of cracking every crime he confronted and possibly even more difficult raising as a lone parent his young daughter to womanhood he had been given time in each cid posting to gather experience and establish his track record but once he had come within sight of the top of the ladder the rest of his climb had been rapid as sir james proud looked at him across the coffee table in his spacious office he knew that only one act remained to bring about the final fulfilment of his vision his own retirement and the installation of his protege as chief constable yet it was something which the two men had discussed only tentatively in the past and never once in those conversations had the deputy allowed himself to anticipate the time when he would sit permanently in the chiefs chair even after an extended period in charge during his bosss enforced absence on sick leave skinner had subtly avoided any detailed discussion of the future or at least of the postproud era so much so that the veteran wondered whether he might have developed an agenda of his own if he had proud mused it was unlikely that assistant chief constable theodore chase featured in it prominently if at all bob skinner was almost invariably tolerant of the views of others he demeaned his own skills as a man manager yet he had gathered around him the most gifted team of detectives on any british force and in spite of his own inclination to keep hands on had given them the leeway they needed to achieve results ted chase though was the exception ruledefying rather than rule proving from the moment that he had settled himself into jim elders old chair the newcomer to the fettes command corridor had set out an agenda which seemed to have been designed to challenge skinners position and authority his peremptory appointment of jack good had started the rot technically the chief could have vetoed it but chase during his excellent interview had subtly established that in the event of his appointment he would have some say in the choice of his personal staff tjien there was his paper his damnably wellcrafted paper on the conimand structure of the force and of the benefits of the deputy being a mirror image of the chief constable rather than someone whose different attributes and skills however admirable they might be as the document had made a point of acknowledging had in the past caused crises in the relationship between the police command and the elected board which supervised its operations proud jimmy had hoped that chase would have backed off if not in the face of skinners clear hostility then of his own mildly discouraging signals but he had not the mans ambition was built of strong materials the old chief had bought time by the simple ruse of saying that he wished to give chase a chance to find his feet in edinburgh while he considered his thoughts at length he knew that this was merely postponing the crisis point the moment when he would either have to tell chase to fall into line or put his paper up for discussion by the board had no other considerations applied he would of course have told the acc what to do with his paper on day one however he had more than a suspicion that if he did that jack good might carelessly allow a copy to fall into the hands of councillor agnes maley bob skinners arch enemy although sir james had contrived to have maley removed from the police board she was still around and capable of making mischief still he had been enjoying his period of peace until that damned civic reception at which the accs wife had made her debut and had behaved in front of sarah skinner and even chrissie by god as if she was lady chase already fervently the chief constable wished that he could discontinue his informal tuesday management sessions with skinner and chase that he could see them separately but not together however he knew that that would only have widened the rift autographs in the rain now as he looked at chase sipping his coffee as if he wanted to get it and the last chocolate digestive biscuit out of the way he could sense anew storm well over the horizon some heavy rain about to fall on his life okay ted he sighed i can read the signs by now stop bristling out with it the acc looked at him as if he had been caught sneaking a biscuit out of turn im sorry sir if i appeared on edge its just that there are a couple of points i have to raise this afternoon and i have a feeling that they may provoke a reaction oh yes said skinner not helping the situation by smiling and what are they ted chase continued to look at sir james ignoring his colleagues grin im finding it increasingly difficult to share a secretary with the deputy sir i dont know how much work my predecessor generated but i really am finding it difficult to secure enough of miss mcconnells time for my needs this week for example mcllhenney seems to be out of the office for long periods and mcconnell is having to cover for his absence why i was in her office yesterday giving her dictation tapes when the dcc buzzed she simply jumped up excused herself and left the room its just not good enough sir i insist either that she is replaced or that i am allocated a secretary of my own skinners smile vanished proud sighed inwardly as the first figurative raindrops began to fall dont you ever the words fell not far short of a snarl suggest again mister that ruth should be moved out the dcc paused waiting for chase to return his gaze but the acc continued to look firmly at sir james okay he exclaimed eventually til support your request for a secretary of your own chases head seemed to turn on a swivel but jack good has to go for a second or two the cumbrians mouth worked like a goldfish tipped on to a kitchen counter but but absolutely no way he protested turning back to proud jimmy for support sir do i or do i not have the right to appoint my own personal staff the chief constable studied his desk as i recall ted you have a say in h that much is certainly true of course he added freezing the accs smirk there are cost considerations how would it be if we gave you your own secretary and replaced inspector good with a promising young sergeant t couldnt accept that i chose good i have great regard for his abilities well no other bastard does skinner boomed the mans your sneak do you think i dont know that do you think i dont know that youve had him going round outstations and even some principal divisional offices making snap inspections and reporting back to you the buggers even been checking on cid he wandered into dan pringles office last week in his wellpressed uniform all that was missing apparently was a swagger stick dan advised him to fuck off but ill bet he didnt tell you that well chase exclaimed raising his voice i am responsible for operations why shouldnt my exec act on my behalf in visiting stations and asking whether they have any operational problems which we can help them solve in principle because you shouldnt have an inspector even appearing to be checking up on a chief super in practice because this ones a twat chief the acc shouted i object to that language what can the dcc have against jack to mistreat a junior officer in that manner sir james sat quietly in his chair skinner with an effort hauled on the frayed reins of his temper if you had consulted jimmy or me he said evenly or anyone else before you were blinded by the shine of his shoes and the gleam of his badge wed have bloody told you jack goods wife is an executive on the scotsman and she has him by the balls weve had three serious leaks to that paper in the last few years and good is suspected of being the source inadvertent or otherwise in every instance thats why he was stuck in the operations room for the duration and only allowed out on special occasions as a bloody ornament then you swan in like a guardian angel and pluck him out of there you might have told me chase complained you didnt give us a chance once youd appointed him we couldnt simply say no weve got nothing we can pin on him we had decided to keep him out of the heart of the action there was nothing wrong with that by the way his record as an officer warranted his previous posting the acc sat back in his chair silenced for the moment then a strange look came into his eyes looking at him sir james proud saw for the first time a sign of malevolence in him good has his uses he said quietly for example this morning he i autographs in the rain back to me on a visit he paid on my instruction to the telecommunications department h told me that he had found a number of very odd installations made by that department over the last couple of days specifically we have just t lied a stateoftheart alarm system in a house in the craiglockhart a of edinburgh this is linked not only to the torphichen place divisional office but also to a private address in the same area on checking good discovered that it is the home of detective inspector mcllhenney the installations were made on the personal instruction of the deputy chief constable further investigation on goods part revealed that the house in which the alarm system is fitted was leased yesterday to a film production company the signatory of the lease was one louise bankier an actress once more chase focused his gaze on the chief constable as he produced a single sheet of paper from a folder on his lap here sir is a cutting from saturdays evening news which appears to link this woman with a senior police officer who is unmistakably our colleague mr skinner chief constable the inescapable conclusion is that the deputy chief has been using police resources to provide sequestrated accommodation for his lady friend during her stay in edinburgh as sir james proud looked at bob skinner he saw the colour drain from his face he pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and glared sternly at chase thank you ted he said now leave the room at once the acc stood a smile of unconstrained triumph on his face and slipped out of the side exit as the door closed proud jimmy looked at the ceiling sorry about that bob he exclaimed but at that moment i thought you were going to kill him skinner was so enraged that he was breathing slightly heavily at that moment jimmy i might have even now you may only have given him a stay of execution the chief dropped into the chair behind his desk what the hell am i going to do about that man he said bring it to a head the dcc snapped put his paper to the board argue against it and have it squashed in the minutes itll read like a reprimand but what if they back it they wont you still have enough on enough of them for them to be afraid to cross you if im wrong about that well i wont be taking any orders from that fucking blackshirt ill tell you that much he sighed but listen thats trivial my big problem is that good knows about lou and that is dangerous given his suspected weakness for pillow talk you know the whole story because i told you straight away i was hoping to avoid it because i just dont trust the man but now chase has to be let in on it as well you speak to him if you will ill handle jack good when it comes to putting the fear of god in people youll concede that im better at it than you the chief let out a sound that was half chuckle half snort you do that then ill send him back to the ops room tomorrow no said skinner quietly keep him here until this is over i want him close where he can feel my hot breath on his neck even though chase wont dare send him out of this office again meantime give the acc a typist just to keep him happy in a strange private way neil mcllhenney was in awe of his daughter of her calmness her maturity and her remarkable common sense for her years since olives death she had replaced her mother as the rock upon which his life was founded therefore it was quite remarkable to see her in awe of someone else louise bankier had not just come for dinner she had provided it king size specials from pizza hut had been delivered ten minutes after neil had brought her round from her secluded address and she had insisted on giving spencer the money to pay for them they had eaten them cut into wedges round the dining table father and children marie the temporarily livingin nanny and their guest lauren had said very little during the meal for once spencer had gone unchecked as he had made the running with a series of quickfire questions which ran the gamut of the movie industry from tom and jerry to tom hanks as neil had watched her he realised that she in turn was studying louise a vivacious vibrant female presence restored unexpectedly to her young life he could not begin to read far less understand all the thoughts which were swirling around in her pre adolescent mind however he was reminded of something that his own grief and their bravery made him overlook too easily the extent to which they too must miss their mother as they prepared to leave lauren and spencer stood politely ready to wish their guest goodbye in keeping with the rest of the evening the youngest mcllhenney had the last word dads taking us skating in princes street gardens on saturday he said would you like to come too hey spence said his father with a grin dont push your luck how did you know i like skating louise responded of course ill cme if your dad lets me i have to do what he says you know he children seemed to look up at him with a new kind of respect okay e sai as long as you continue to remember one thing that ms bankier autographs in the rain being here is not to be talked about at school or to anyone outside this room understood spencer nodded lauren simply said father throwing him an old young reproving look that he had seen so often before and which never failed to tug at his heart louise laughed its a date then hot dogs on your dad he whistled as they stepped out into the moonless sodiumlit night add two more names to the fanclub he said two i always was a fan he murmured thats good to know she answered as he opened the car door for her where are we going then she asked as he slid into his seat beside her somewhere discreet you said yes and somewhere ill feel comfortable in the dark where are you going to find an empty cinema in this town im not but wait and see the next best thing they had been driving for less than ten minutes when neil turned off morningside road and parked close to a small but welllit cinema one of the oldfashioned kind rather than a modern multiplex this is where i take the kids the dominion were going to cinema three its about the size of your average living room you really dont mind going to american beauty i mean you must have seen it no honestly i havent she said you may find this odd but i dont go to the movies much he led her quickly past two short queues of cinemagoers and past the box office i picked up the tickets earlier he explained and i had a quiet word with the manager the only things i asked was that we go in first so that i can eyeball the rest of the audience there only are a couple of dozen seats though she said nothing but looked sideways at him with a quiet smile two and a half hours later they stepped back out into the foyer this time there was no slipping unnoticed past the crowd word had spread and scores of people were waiting holding diaries leaflets future attraction fliers scraps of paper anything that would accommodate an autograph neil stood back as she signed studying every person as they stepped up noting the time she spent with every one and the interest she seemed to take in them all finally it was over as they stepped outside he asked her is it like that every time pretty much she said linking her arm through his as they headed for the car she chuckled enigmatically but at least tonight it isnt raining stevie steele didnt mind newcastle but he did have a strong aversion to wild geese as he stood in the street outside the st james internet cafe he fancied that he heard a fluttering of wings he had spent a good part of the previous day in front of a screen studying the jerky images provided by the balmoral hotels video security system trying to put a face to louise bankiers stalker trying in vain yes there had been that one image a slim man of medium height wearing a loose raincoat and a black hat he had stopped at the reception desk and stood there for a while his back to the camera throughout appearing to steele at any rate to peruse some of the information leaflets on display there then the receptionist had turned to pick up a telephone there had been a movement very little no more than a flick of a wrist and the appearance of something small flying through the air and falling behind the counter only the appearance that was all unless you added the fact that a few seconds afterwards as the receptionist ended her call the man had walked off without turning towards the hotels side exit the only certainty that stevie steele had at the end of the day was that there was nothing else on those security tapes they were patchy in their quality and worse they switched from camera to camera he had walked around the hotel and confirmed what he suspected that each one had a red live light and that anyone with half a brain would be aware when he was being filmed and when he was not the only other slim clue to the identity of the actresss persecutor was that one cryptic email message from the threateningly named john steed it was the only potential lead he had left and he was even beginning to doubt that sure its use of the word bitch was offensive but it was still possible that it was nothing more than a letter from a fan with an odd turn of phrase the only chance of finding out lay in the newcastle cafe from which it had been sent he opened the door and stepped inside autographs in the rain stevie steele was something of a nethead himself he had a home computer and an email address through which he had built up a small network of friends around the world he knew what a cybercafe was a dropoff point at which those without their own internet connection or more likely people travelling away from home could buy online time and coffee while they used it he could see their value in big tourist centre cities and in airports but he was slightly surprised that there was sufficient custom on tyneside to drive such a business as soon as he stepped inside he could see that his scepticism was justified the cafe side of the business seemed lively enough but the three computer terminals which sat on desks against the far wall were all idle a screensaver was displayed on one but the others were switched off as he looked at it a middleaged woman approached him she wore a designer suit and a pleasant smile can i help you she asked in a tone which suggested that that was genuinely what she wanted to do mrs egremont yes im ds steele i called you this morning ah yes the smile stayed in place but behind it was something that he had seen many times before the natural uncertainty sparked by a visit from a policeman he tried to put her at her ease at once im grateful you could see me so quickly he said its nothing to do with you really im trying to trace a customer of yours he reached into his jacket and took out the printout of the steed email this was sent on november the ninth through hotmail from this location the userid is john steed but that mailbox hasnt been used since im hoping that you can recall something about him that will help us trace him paula egremont frowned is this nuisance mail she asked you could say that let me look at my diary she walked over to the till counter and took out a book from a ledge underneath november nine you said thats right a thursday she opened the desk diary and turned over page after page until she round that date her lips moved unconsciously as she read yes she said at last with evident satisfaction t do remember him i had a visit from a coffee rep that day he had supplied me with some poor quality stuff and we had a row about it while we were having it the only other person in the place was my only internet customer of the day a young man in his twenties cleanshaven wearing jeans timberland boots or something of that ilk and a heavy donkey type jacket you know him she shook her head never seen him before or since but the truth is i dont have all that many net customers so i tend to remember them fairly easily can you tell me anything else about him he had a pale complexion and he wore rimless glasses could have been gucci we didnt say much to each other though he came in asked for a coffee pointed at the machine and i switched it on id just given him his coffee when that damn rep came in by the time id finished complaining to him he was signing off he finished his coffee paid and left she smiled apologetically thats all i can tell you im afraid apart oh yes i nearly forgot apart from the hat he was wearing a black hat i detective sergeant jack mcgurk grumbled quietly to himself as he drove down the country road dan pringle was a good guy to work for most of the time but when he felt under pressure he tended to share it around when he started to indulge in creative thinking anything could happen his bright idea of keeping mercy alvarez country fresh trout under secret video surveillance was a prime example it was fine in theory costeffective policing that did a job without tying up teams of detectives round the clock but in practice some poor bugger still had to go and change the tape every so often first thing in the morning too to lessen the chances of his being spotted of course secrecy being the watchword and dan being too new in the division to know whom he could trust completely that poor bugger just had to be jack mcgurk the sergeant had mixed feelings about his transfer to the borders it would mean a move south away from the city even now he was living through the week in a furnished police flat in newtown st boswells on the other hand dan pringle had more or less promised him that if he did the job for three years he would swing him a quick promotion to inspector that was a distant prospect though as he stopped beside the fence which bounded the woods in which the video cameras were hidden in a camouflaged box he could approach through the trees without any danger of being seen from the farm and the road was so isolated that he could leave without attracting any other attention the downside was that at daybreak the forest was still dark and the trees were dripping wet he took his rubber boots from the well of the passenger seat and pulled them on then slipped into his barbour slapping the deep pockets to make sure that he was carrying the fresh tapes and fully charged batteries he made his way through the woods it was thursday morning and he was making the trip for the third time so even in the gloom he knew the way fairly well it had taken him half an hour to find the box on his first morning and he had only just managed to avoid being spotted by the manager as she made her first round of the tanks the box opened from the back he slipped the cameras out one by one exchanged the tapes then finally replaced the depleted batteries finally his job done he risked a look across the clearing mcgurk would have crept away had he not noticed the door kath adeys cottage lay open to the morning chill yet there was no sign of her quickly he glanced around the compound the suzuki jeep which he had seen on his first visit and which he had assumed was hers was still there parked beside one of the sheds he listened there was no sound but the beat of the pumps and the steady splashing of the circulating water and then he looked at the tanks maybe the fish were asleep for there were no signs of trout breaking the surface no signs offish snapping at the food insect or artificial which he had noticed there before yet there was something something much bigger than any trout something in the tank nearest the cottage something floating face down oh shit detective sergeant jack mcgurk muttered as he forgot all about secrecy breaking his cover to rush across the clearing rubber boots flapping awkwardly as he ran for many years andrew john had worn a beard although it had disappeared shortly after the arrival of its first grey hairs andy martin imagined it in place still as he took a seat in the bankers small office in a depressing concrete building in the grassmarket john was a good friend and occasional golf partner of bob skinner and had proved invaluable to him over the years as a sounding board in the business sector sorry to drag you in here so early andy he began but im only paying flying visits to my office this week thats one of the bad things about the commercial side of our business he gave a quick bright laugh and glanced around the small dull room or maybe its one of the good things i spend more time in my customers offices than i do in my own i used to be able to say the same said the head of cid now im scratching around for excuses to get out of the office i found one the other day though he continued thats what brought me here i had occasion to pay a visit to a trout farm near coldstream oh exclaimed andrew john rolling his eyes at the detective and leaning back in his chair country fresh the wellyboot contessa apart from the fact that contessas are italian not spanish thats the very lady whats she been up to martin held up his hands palms outwards nothing nothing at all honest i went to see her because weve had a couple of major thefts from fish farms in that area they both lost all their stock had it hoovered up into container trucks through big suction hoses in both cases their security was crap my guys visited her after the second theft and saw that hers is too she was a bit offhand when they told her she should improve it so i went down to give her a slightly heavier message she told me shed have to speak to you before she did anything so i autographs in the rain thought id have a quiet word with you too were about to recommend to the insurers that they get very tough with farmers who use their policies as alternatives to crime prevention provisions i thought you should be aware of that when she asks you for spending approval or an increased facility or whatever thanks andy said the banker i appreciate that within these four walls it wont make my decision any easier though im as exposed to that lady already as i want to be to that whole sector in fact martin looked at him in surprise whys that ach most of these places are penny operations theres so much fanned salmon on the market now either raised here or dumped by the norwegians that its depressing the price of trout i used to have half a dozen trout farmers as clients most of them estate owners who saw it as a way of making some extra money now ive got only two mercy alvarez and one other the other ones all right for now because hes worked out that the only way to profitability is to add value to the stuff before you let it out the farm gate by processing on site mercy though she just raises it quick and sells it quick so shes dancing around the breakeven line all the time thats no use to me i want to lend to businesses that are going to expand and become more substantial bank customers in the future in that respect fish farms are second last on my wish list whats last asked the detective amused football clubs they soak up tons of borrowing but how do you foreclose on them you dont you sponsor them ah in an ideal world you only sponsor them never lend let some other bugger do that so has mercy been in touch with you since monday no but ive been away from the office remember he leaned across his desk and flicked through a pile of yellow message slips yes theres a note here asking me to call her this morning when you do get in touch with her whatll you say ach i dont know whats the damage likely to be i cant say for sure but i can tell you it wont be any more than next years insurance premium if she doesnt install he broke off as his mobile rang he took it from his pocket excusing himself as he answered i across the desk andrew john saw the chief superintendents face darken fuck he swore quietly im coming down dan is dorward on his way good he ended the call and put the phone away the horse has bolted andrew he said the fish have swum use any analogy you fucking like your customers farm has been done only this time theyve left a casualty behind and it isnt a bloody trout what john gave him a look of pure incredulity kath adey the manager someone hit her over the head then dumped her in a fish tank shes dead andy martin made a point of learning by experience on his second visit to country fresh trout he left his mgf in the care of a uniformed constable stationed at the head of the farm track and called for a police land rover to take him along the rough last leg of the journey dan pringle was standing at the door of the managers cottage as his driver pulled up and he jumped out a black panel van with a spinning ventilator on its roof was parked outside its rear doors open as the head of cid approached his colleague he passed it and glanced inside a plastic coffin lay on the floor its lid alongside it he caught a glimpse of a white face bluetinged tell me about it he asked quietly jack found her said the superintendent the only person on the scene apart from martin himself who was not wearing a white tunic he came to change the tapes in the video and he saw the girl floating in the tank what did the doctor say just what i told you on the phone he put the time of death at shortly after midnight and said that the cause was probably cerebral injury rather than drowning she was battered about the head with something solid then chucked in the tank we found this just beside where the body was floating weve been all over the place looking for a murder weapon everywhere save the tanks theyre not all that deep but given the cold well need to use divers in dry suits if were going to search them properly the subaqua teams on the way down from edinburgh right now effing and blinding all the way ill betcha why the hell did the bastards have to kill her martin muttered grimly well maybe have an answer to that when we have a look at the tapes maybe well have an answer to everything do we know if she received any phone calls or tried to make any pringle frowned not with the cable cut she didnt autographs in the rain the chief superintendent looked sharply at him wheres the alvarez woman he asked i dont know she lives in coldstream but shes not there well you find her dan wherever she is something stinks about this and i dont mean the fish i gave her till friday to have her security installed and this happens two days before he shook his head and slammed his left fist painfully into his right palm in sudden remorseful anger that girl in the van i told her not to leave the farm unattended i read her the bloody riot act and told her that whatever happened she shouldnt leave the fish im going to have these guys mate he said evenly and if ms alvarez does have anything to do with it then god help her send mcgurk and however many people it takes out to find her meanwhile you and i are going up to edinburgh to see the technical people and get as much as we can out of those tapes the head of human resources stared at mackenzie as if he had just asked he to undertake a free climb in winter up the north face of the eiger you cannot seriously expect me to tell you that off the top of my head margaret mair exclaimed the inspector looked at the top of her head on which her hair was drawn into a tight grey bun she reminded him of his first primary teacher a warrior quite literally of the old school for all his urbanity for all his authority he felt a memory of infant intimidation run through him he braved her glare of course i dont miss mair he assured her but i would like you to find out for me its easy to say that young man but not nearly as easy to do it youre talking about the old days of british railways this man mcconnell retired fifteen years ago things have changed since then were privatised now and many of the old personnel records simply dont exist any more those that do might have been transferred to railtrack or to scotrail or to another of the operating companies it would all depend on what mr mcconnell did someone would be paying his pension surely thats a different thing altogether and besides there are thousands upon thousands of pensioners mackenzie decided to change tack but miss mair im not necessarily talking about personnel records alone human resources now she nitpicked not even them i simply want to speak to anyone who might have known this man and with whom he might have had continuing contact over the years okay hes been gone for fifteen years but there must be some people still around in the organisation who remember him and remember who his friends were her lips pursed mr mcconnell didnt necessarily have any friends she said unexpectedly autographs in the rain you remember him yes mr mackenzie as a matter of fact i do i didnt know him you understand he was a senior manager then and i was only a junior executive and i dont recall what section he worked in however assuming that its the same man and i suppose it must be i do recall that he was not regarded as a very nice man she gave a brief but severe nod of her head particularly by the female members of staff the policeman saw her embarrassment and took secret delight in it why was that miss mair he asked ingenuously she sniffed he had a bit of a reputation among the younger girls at any rate they used to call him she paused and for that second he thought he saw her blush they used to call him feely john he had the name of being a bit of a toucher always accidental of course and given his rank no one ever complained but most of the girls didnt like to get too close to him what about the others were there any who didnt mind there were a couple of girls she said there were rumours shall we say they were both flighty types and neither of them worked here long there was gossip once about someone walking into a room at an office party but the detail of it never came to my ears bet it did thought mackenzie but itll never pass your tight old lips now what about male colleagues do you recall anyone with whom he was particularly friendly for example im told that his former sisterinlaw married a colleague of his her name would have been mcconnell too she died about twenty years ago does any of that ring bells no it does not as i told you i did not associate with the man nor did i even know his section in that case do you know anyone who might have mr mackenzie she exclaimed indignant once more i am not a mine of information nor a hoarder of old office gossip i never suggested that you were he said at once in his best mollifying tone all i was hoping to do was to draw on your experience the womans stiff spine seemed to unbend just a fraction very well she conceded if you leave the matter with me i will search my memory rurther and consult other senior colleagues former sisterinlaw you said she pursed her lips again as if she did not approve of sistersinlaw in the former category it may take some time and i can make no promises however if you leave me your telephone number i shall see what i can do you realise gentlemen that you are not going to be seeing a seventymil movie here tony davidson pointed out the forces director of telecommunications had a reputation for plain speaking this is not hollywood we cannot trace fleeing criminals by satellite in the dark we may be able to tell where a specific dustcart is at any moment during its round but thats about it what were playing with here is way short of being even as advanced as that lets have a whack at it anyway tony said andy martin we wont blame you for failing to work miracles but theres a dead girl demanding that we all do our best dan and i will have to take a press conference later on today and it would be nice to have something positive to say davidson nodded and turned off the light in the small viewing room for best results he pressed the start switch of a big video player which sat on a table cabled to a monitor screen on a tall stand this is the first tape he said as a greentinted image appeared on the screen it has a twelvehour slow speed capacity so what were looking for should be towards the middle it has a time display so ill wind it forward to midnight they waited watching as the tape wound on little or nothing changing save for the blur of the white indicators in the bottom left corner of the picture as the hours minutes and seconds flashed by finally the technical director pressed a button and the numbers steadied showing the record time as four minutes past the midnight hour on screen the shape of the compound could be made out they could see the tanks with odd sparkles of green light from the everflowing water as it caught the light from a single window in the cottage beyond they listened and could hear its constant soft tinkle and the dull sound of the pumps davidson ran the tape on switching from slow motion to normal speed sending the time indicator turning faster but still legibly autographs in the rain suddenly with hours showing on screen there was a different movement quickly he froze the picture then returned it to its original running rate looking intently they saw the green ghostly outline of a figure walking across the clearing towards the house a talllong striding man he was dressed in boots and a long hooded jacket and he appeared to be carrying something light in his left hand whats that asked pringle of no one in particular could be a sheet davidson replied or a sack or a tarpaulin the man in the video walked straight up to the cottage righthanded he banged on the front door the knock was loud enough for them to hear above the splashing then stood back round the corner out of sight from anyone who might open it freeze it martin ordered the detectives and the technician studied the still frame on screen id say that he wants the girl to come out so that he can throw that sheet or whatever over her head so why didnt she run it on please tony the scene played itself out the man stood waiting tensed the covering now held in both hands at last they saw another movement another figure a little smaller than him but stocky behind him moving towards him slowly its the girl pringle exclaimed shes come out the back door she was almost on him when he dropped the sheet and turned they saw the blur of movement as she swung at him his hand coming up to catch hers the two greenghost figures together in a silent struggle then as they watched his right hand wrenched clear with something in it his arm rose and fell there was a scream another blow another fainter shout then blow after blow after blow oh my god davidson hissed thats it said martin the plan was to throw that sheet over her head and tie her up while the robbery went ahead but the poor lass had a go she saw his face and he killed her someone she knew pringle mused maybe maybe not but someone shed have been able to identify and then as they watched the screen was filled with green light and the roar of engines came from the speakers four wide beams swung across the picture two of them lighting up a dark shape like that of a petrol tanker then the first shafts of light swung round and shone directly into the camera obliterating all other images even the time readout in the corner dammit shouted pringle in frustration they watched the film for fifteen minutes seeing only green but hearing the sound of the farms machinery harshly throbbing diesel engines and something else louder than the pumps the whoosh of fish and water being sucked from the tanks occasionally an indistinct figure would be framed against the light carrying what could have been a long flexible hose then would move out of shot once again finally it was over the noise of the suction engines stopped as the three listened they heard a single loud splash then another softer then the slamming of vehicle doors it seemed to take the camera some seconds to adjust to the darkness once more when it did the clearing was empty and the scene was as it had been at first save for the fact that the front door of the cottage now stood open and that on the tank nearest to it something no someone floated the head of cid punched the stop button on the player killing what was left of the sound im sorry said davidson in the darkness even before he switched on the light as i said there are limitations to this technology shining a bright light into the lens of a night vision camera will bugger it for sure the man tony asked martin is there anything you can do to isolate and enhance that image to get a face out of it no im afraid not even if he hadnt been wearing that hooded jacket i couldnt get you the sort of definition you need how about those guys who appeared in shot carrying the sucker hoses without the headlamps probably but with all that light behind them not a prayer ah too bad the head of cid sighed then brightened up almost at once still dan he said its not a total loss we can wave those tapes about at our press conference the killer and his pals theyre not going to know theyre useless are they neil mcllhenney reflected on his day as he drove up colinton road there had been an air of unmistakable tension about the place and clear signs that something had happened the accs new secretary for a start drafted in without warning not a hint dropped by ruth in his direction that chase had won his unsubtle battle to increase his personal staff then there had been jack good he never could stand the boiledshirt bastard and even less so since he had made inspector and had shown himself to be the sort who glared when a junior uniform failed to salute him and who insisted on being sirred all the time even by his contemporaries guys who had known him for years but all that day the same jack good had been a bag of nerves he had bumped into him three times in the corridor twice he had been coming out of the toilet but on the first occasion he had been leaving the dccs room on every encounter he had been jumpy like a man trying to get out of the path of a speeding car yes something was up all right and he deduced that it had to do with acc chase and that peculiar grin which he had been carrying all day bob skinner often told mcllhenney more than he needed to know but he never talked about anything that went on inside the chiefs room unless there was a clear reason for it he had never suggested that tension might possibly exist between chase and himself he had never needed to of course neil knew his boss well enough to understand that coppers like chase were anathema to him he had never mentioned chases notorious paper either any more than had ruth who had typed it he might still not have known about it but for a series of heavyhanded hints from good which had eventually provoked him to exclaim one day in his own small office jack exactly what the fuck are you talking about it had to be that damned paper that lay behind chases smirk yet if it was why was his aide so clearly shiteing himself autographs in the rain ah what the hell he thought as he turned into his driveway the boss ii tell me when hes good and ready he drove his car into the garage checked with marie that lauren and spencer were fine then walked the short distance round to louise bankiers safe house as he opened the garden gate he saw almost hidden behind a tall hedge a silvergrey renault megane hatchback he glanced at the registration glasgow of course lucys lou had mentioned that her sister was bringing her father through to see her he rang the bell its echo had barely died before louise swung it open hey he said trying to look severe i thought i told you not to do that take a look through the peephole first i saw you coming up the path and eyeballing poor wee lucys car too he smiled as he noticed that she sounded more glaswegian than ever come and meet the guys she said warren judd and elliott silver had been gone by the time he had arrived the evening before to pick her up he studied them both carefully but politely as she introduced them judd was a short stocky man about his own age he guessed he flashed him a smile and was taken aback by the hostility in the look which he shot back silver was ten years younger in his late twenties of medium height and light build with soft features and unlike his colleague possessed of a ready endearing smile behind them at the window another man stood he was big at least six two bulky shoulders in a denim shirt black hair cut close mcllhenneys eyebrows began to rise unconsciously until lucy walked over to him and took his arm this is barren mason my boyfriend she said hes never met my famous sister before louise smiled at them then exclaimed with more pride in her voice than he had heard before and last but the opposite of least the most important man in my life malcolm bankier my dad dad this is neil mcllhenney whos sort of looking after me while im here the old man in the armchair made to push himself up on a thick brown cane you stay there mr bankier please said the detective laying his left hand gently on his shoulder and offering him his right he settled back then shook it with a gnarled twisted arthritic claw looking not at louise but at his younger daughter who was perched on the broad arm of the chair who is he he exclaimed she got another man shh dad whispered lucy no thats not it the old mans face seemed to brighten up ah hes yours then he cackled lucys got a fella the young woman flushed no mr bankier said neil im not so privileged i work for louise im responsible for her accommodation while shes in edinburgh i just looked in to check on her schedule for tomorrow work for her you say his voice though wavering still kept its cultured middleclass glaswegian tones he waved his stick at judd and silver like these two suddenly his eyes narrowed and he beckoned the policeman tfwards him as mcllhenney leaned over malcolm bankier nodded towards warren judd that wee chap there he hissed loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear watch him seen him before somewhere dont like him neil could think of nothing to say to fill the embarrassing silence but the old man did it for him thought id seen you before too he said with louise long time ago when she was a lass and my wee lucy was a baby not you though someone else sorry lucy bankier glanced up at her sister who nodded come on daddy she said lou says tea will be ready lets go to the dining room she never said a bloody word mr bankier grumbled but he allowed her to help him to his feet and out of the room when they were gone louise looked apologetically at judd im sorry about that warren she said his memorys all over the place these days he hasnt a clue what hes saying dont worry about it the producer laughed but it seemed to mcllhenney without real humour i do though for example i worry for my sister left in bearsden to look after him i give her nursing help of course but he goes through them at a rate of knots ive had to move agencies twice the alzheimers has changed his personality completely for one thing its made him a dirty old man and im not just talking about his toilet habits it makes me so sad hes only seventyfive you know and he wears a bloody nappy yet there are men in their eighties whove as fit as fiddles this started off as one of his better days too well exclaimed judd brusquely wed best leave you with him then as we agreed dont you worry about tomorrow boy wonder and i will take care of that see you on monday to start the new town shooting he turned on his heel and left the room silver in his wake autographs in the rain your dads not as wandered as all that is he mcllhenney murmured hes right about friend judd for a start he never did like warren she snapped he felt rebuffed she saw it and apologised at once im sorry neil im just a bit touchy on that subject soshe i reckon dont take it personally then she smiled no she said take it personally if you like she paused and looked at him you know who he mistook you for dont you she asked i can make a pretty good guess how much has bob told you very little only that you two were close a long time ago but last friday night when we drove back from gullane i knew who you were talking about he was the one eh the big hurt twentyfive years ago yup she admitted and isnt it strange now that dad should mistake you for him you two being such good friends and colleagues and everything she sighed daddy was furious you know furious with bob when we broke up i never talked about him afterwards you know but once when i was visiting home when lucy would be about fourteen he said something in front of her about having seen him on television i had to tell her the whole story until that moment i hadnt realised just how angry he had been she laughed and then on monday evening when he called in she was here and they met i wondered how shed react but you know she just melted she fell for him on the spot just like me two and a half decades before her i tell you its just as well he loves his wife or bob skinner could do untold damage in my family still he chuckled speaking of families i must get back to mine i gather that youve called off your meeting tomorrow yes glenys and i are having another day with the script the guys can finish the location recces theres only one i want to do myself wheres that he asked youll find out she told him mysteriously on saturday autographs in the rain i i where did you find her dan asked andy martin she turned up at her house in coldstream just after five oclock two uniforms spotted her and detained her until mcgurk picked her up and brought her up here to galashiels were just about to question her so far shes brassing it out though she claims she has no idea why we want to talk to her mcgurk was smart enough not to play along with her though hes said nothing at all to her other than that shes wanted for questioning weve let her stew in it so far but were ready to talk to her now have you seen her at all not yet has she seen a lawyer she was allowed to phone her lawyer in coldstream hes a real old country lawyer with more sense than to go anywhere near a criminal matter so hes sent up the young lad in his office who does what little sheriff court work he has hes just arrived but he can see her at the same time as i do jack sneaked a quick look at him he says he looks still wet behind the ears but full of himself puffed up like a rooster nah said martin dryly theres a difference between a rooster and a lawyer whats that a rooster clucks defiance the head of cid cut across pringles laugh what does mcgurk think about the woman he reckons shes lying in her fucking teeth the superintendent glanced across his office at the sergeant mind you jacks still a bit upset after finding that poor lass hes desperate to nail someone for it ill make up my own mind about her go and do it then p martin just remember though mcgurk n j doesnt know as we do that it couldnt have been her hitting the girl on the tape no but you dont know that wasnt her we saw framed in the lights of that lorry true admitted the head of cid go do it then pringle hung up and nodded to mcgurk come on he led the way out of the room downstairs and into the waiting area he spotted the lawyer at once from his sergeants description no more than twentyfive years old smoothcheeked looking precociously pompous in a pinstriped suit mr mark taggart the policeman asked yes the young man exclaimed inspector i insist on seeing my client at once or must i speak to your superiors thats superintendent to you pringle barked dan pringle divisional cid commander and dont fucking threaten me son now you come on wi us and youll see your client but i want to see her alone the young man protested so does ds mcgurk here but were all going to see her together and youre going to keep your mouth shut and let us get on with our interview this is a murder investigation as im sure you know by this time the young lawyer gulped almost comically leaving pringle to guess that any briefing he had been given before he left coldstream might have been less than complete your client hasnt actually killed anyone son but she still has a few questions to answer about her possible knowledge of the crime im not going to caution her at this stage if i decide to in the light of anything she says ill stop the interview and advise you at once until then youre in there because of my generosity of spirit and thats all mercy alvarez was waiting for them in a small windowless room at the rear of the ground floor of the divisional headquarters building the air was thick with cigarette smoke as the two detectives entered pringle felt an old familiar pang the woman glared at them through the blue haze but said nothing the female constable who sat silently with her rose and made to leave until pringle shook his head signalling her to stay he placed twin tapes in the recorder on the table then switched it on identifying everyone in the room for the record weve got a problem with you ms ah the superintendent blurted autographs in the rain out as soon as he had completed the formalities what you mean she snapped well there were only a handful of us who knew that as of friday youd have video security installed on your farm there was you there was jack and me and there was our boss mr martin he paused oh aye and there was kath adey all of which makes it very iffy that last night someone should have broken into your site and emptied out your tanks in view of the short time thats gone by since the last robbery it makes me wonder whether someone tigped off these guys that they only had a couple of days what mercy alvarez interrupted her dark eyes widening country fresh is been robbed good said pringle im impressed by that reaction maybe i was meant to be but im not convinced someone told that gang that they had to do your place before friday now it wasnt dcs martin and it wasnt ds mcgurk and it wasnt me so that just leaves you superintendent mark taggart exclaimed shut up you did you set up your own farm to be robbed ms alvarez the womans face twisted in anger no i did not she spat anyhow you miss someone out what about kath jack mcgurk shook his head we dont think it was her ms alvarez why not she shouted why you accuse me not her the burly superintendent leaned across the table because no ones bashed your head in and chucked you in a fish tank he said quietly because youre not lying in the fucking mortuary up in edinburgh with your brain beside you in a stainless steel dish dan pringle was long past the stage in his police career when he believed that he could be surprised by anyone or anything but right there right then mercy alvarez surprised him she fell off her chair in a dead faint an hour went by before a doctor certified that she had recovered sufficiently for the interview to proceed she was so shaken that pringle was convinced there and then that she had known nothing of her managers murder his tone was gentler when he resumed his questioning lets start again ms alvarez he said when was the last time you saw miss adey alive at four oclock yesterday afternoon when i left the farm to go home okay now i repeat my earlier question did you have any knowledge that your farm was going to be robbed no i did not i swear it did you mention to anyone that the police were insisting that you install security equipment no why should i do i have to spell that out if you do superintendent said the young solicitor a little braver now i shall have to insist that the rest of this interview takes place under caution okay pringle conceded if she did set the place up to be robbed shes no going to admit it caution or not ill rephrase it then did you mention to anyone however innocently that you were considering installing a system i told my bank managers secretary that that was what i wanted to see him about do you know if miss adey spoke with anyone after mr martins visit on monday she might have but only by telephone she never leave the farm after that i guess she spoke to the video man what video man a salesman who came see us a few months ago he left us information then and a card i told kate to phone him was his name anders asked mcgurk yes i think that was it pringle looked at the sergeant enquiring i found a leaflet and a card by the phone in the cottage he explained there was an entry in miss adeys diary too she had an appointment with raymond anders of eildon security at four this afternoon on the farm the superintendent drew mcgurk into a corner lets find out whether he kept it he whispered lets find out too but very quietly whether he paid any unsuccessful sales visits to the other two farms the tall detective nodded and left the room just one other thing ms alvarez pringle continued for now at any rate where were you all day today when we were trying to contact you t was with my boyfriend she said hesitantly his name is glenn lander he had a dinner party last night i stayed over and all day four of us his cousin from england was there with her husband hes a policeman an important policeman i think his name is ted ted chase theres nowhere else to go sir said stevie steele his frustration written all pver his face this bloke exists all right this man calling himself john steed but im no closer to him now than i was at the start t took the best still print from the balmoral video that the techies could provide for me and showed it to the woman in newcastle but she said that she couldnt have identified her own son from the view it showed she said that the guys hat in the print looked similar to the one her customer wore but lets face it a black hats a black hat aye ive got one myself andy martin sighed thats the second time in quick succession that ive been let down by a video tape give a copy of the print to mcllhenney maybe louise bankier or her secretary will spot something in it apart from that theres only one other thing you can do and thats pursue the possibility that this lad really is called john steed and that his message was badly worded but otherwise innocent im doing that already sir steele replied the police on tyneside have reported back to me already theyve turned up three john steeds ones in jail anothers in his eighties and the third is a hemiplegic i even asked them to check on people named john stead just in case the man might have mistyped his own surname when he sent the message no joy there either im waiting for other forces to report back ive asked for traces as far south as middlesbrough and also in london and in our own area where the two incidents have occurred fair enough said bob skinner turning away from the window of the head of cids office it all has to be done but youll get nothing from it big neils first instinct was right the names a phoney part of the message itself well trace mr steed when he has another go at louise and not before and hell find that difficult while shes under surveillance martin suggested autographs in the rain agreed but next week lou starts location work on her movie thats when shell be vulnerable we can protect her and we will by blocking off the streets where theyre filming shell have a dressing room trailer too but shell still be an open target to an extent what about the crew sir asked steele are they being checked out of course they are sergeant said the dcc testily di mcllhenneys getting a list this morning from judd the producer everyone on the team from elliott silver the director right up to the teaboy hell run a pnc check straight away he sighed and come up with fuck all too apart from a couple of potsmokers what about judd himself skinner frowned at martins question he was the first one neil checked he and louise lived together for a while a few years back they talked about getting married but she decided that shed had enough of that game judd didnt like it they had a major argument and they split up but not before he thumped her she almost turned this movie down because of mr judd but she liked the part her agent pressed her and finally he apologised so she agreed do not worry andy his was the first name out of the hat when this all blew up he was even in the hotel on the day that smoke bomb was planted in lous room but he is not the man in the hotel video and he was not john steed in newcastle the physical descriptions just dont match up the guy in the black hat is slim and judds a wee bull of a fellow on top of that from the moment that he arrived at the balmoral all the way through their tour of edinburgh during their meeting afterwards and right up to the moment he left lou swears that he was never out of her sight and that silver was with them the whole time too the big dcc scowled id love it to be judd itd give me a chance to teach him not to knock women around but it isnt he looked at steele so thats where we are young stevie waiting for the stalker to pull another stunt i hope he does too i dont want him just to fade away i want him caught now will you excuse us please i have to talk to mr martin about something unconnected with this of course sir ill find di mcllhenney and give him that print as the door closed behind him martin looked at skinner well he asked yes a grin spread across his face ive spoken to him interviewed him even with the chief constable present mr chase and his lovely wife estelle were indeed entertained by mrs chases cousin on wednesday night they dined on fish soup prepared by ms alvarez braised venison prepared by mr lander and praline ice cream prepared by haagendazs the assistant chief constable having consumed no alcohol all evening he and his good lady began the drive back to edinburgh at am leaving the young lovers slightly the worse for the third bottle of paternina banda azul rioja tinto and about to retire for the night we left him pondering the possibility of being subjected to aggressive crossexamination by a hungry advocate depute that was nice of you laughed the head of cid it wont come to that though dan phoned me a while back raymond anders of eildon security who failed to turn up for his four oclock appointment with kath adey yesterday has also visited the mellerkirk and howdengate trout farms in unsuccessful attempts to sell them video surveillance and alarm systems every copper in the borders is looking for him but hes disappeared dans about to issue a press statement with a description and an appeal for public support in tracing him looks like he could be our man l just like rockefeller plaza louise bankier looked along the ice rink thronged with circling figures on silver skates some steady and assured others much less so they do this every christmas time yes neil replied skating in princes street gardens its a tradition already even though theyve only been doing it for a few years nice though especially on a day like this he leaned forward on the green park bench tightening the laces of his left boot the morning was crisp and cold the ice hard and inviting spencer and lauren leaned on the fence at the entrance to the rink waiting watching as their father checked the fastenings on the shiny new boots which glenys algodon had acquired for louise the day before no one took any notice of them as they readied themselves to take to the ice the actress wore tight black trousers and a heavy parka with a furtrimmed hood so enveloping that it hid her face as effectively as a mask okay he said as she leaned her weight on his outstretched left arm away you go then she pushed herself away and set off deliberately and carefully after the children who were circling and pirouetting with fearless confidence at the very first turn her legs went from under her she fell with a bump lauren gasped spencer laughed then neil was beside her helping her to her feet here he chuckled i thought you said you could do this im supposed to be looking after you if you turn up for filming on crutches next week ill be back on the beat t can skate she insisted with mock indignation im just out of practice thats all he steadied her his strong hands on her waist get away with you lady its like riding a bike you never forget okay so let me go and ill show you he released her and she set off once more slowly but more steadily this time he skated easily alongside autographs in the rain her watching her closely until finally she gathered confidence and began to move more easily youre quite good she told him when she felt able to speak for a flatfooted copper you mean her laugh had a breathless edge if you say so i played ice hockey when i was a kid he replied evenly after i chucked it i didnt skate for a while during my porker years but then i started rollerblading with those two and it seemed natural to take them on to the ice and show them the real thing theyre really good ah but so am i show me nah too many people on the ice plus i dont want to draw attention to us she saw him glancing around youre always watching arent you always at that moment an unsteady skater a young man veered in their direction neil swung smoothly round putting his body between the approaching figure and louise then catching him steadying him and sending him gently on his way they skated on for around twenty minutes lauren and spencer weaving patterns around them until finally she called enough they left the children to their ice ballet and skated off the rink reclaiming their shoes from the kiosk and changing into them on their bench that done they leaned against the fence watching the action on the ice wincing as the occasional beginner came to grief hey she asked glancing at him from the depths of her hood what did you mean earlier your porker years he smiled with a touch of shyness i used to be a far bigger boy than i am now olive used to go on at me about my weight my father died of a heart attack at spences christening and she was always worried that the same might happen to me i just laughed it off i was big sure but i wasnt that unfit i could still chase the bad guys and like everyone else i had this notion that i was immortal that the two of us were then olive fell ill and we knew that we werent i didnt entertain the idea that she would die right up to the very last second in that wee side ward i didnt believe that she would but the mere thought that she could that was enough one of my nightmares is that anything might happen to me while those two are still kids while they still need me so i do everything i can to make sure it doesnt im thirty pounds lighter than i was back then i go to the gym run a bit and play football with the bosss crowd once a week i drink very little alcohol any more and im careful about what i eat plus i have a job that takes me out of the line of fire she looked at him surprised then what are you doing with me he scratched his chin thats a good question i asked it of myself and i asked it of olive i talk to her a lot you know all the time in fact the answer is that im doing what she would want me to do he gave her a confessional smile she likes you you know im honoured louise whispered sincerely so he asked her suddenly ending that moment warren judd my last big mistake she said and he will be i thought i knew everything there was to know about men i thought i was always in control i thought that he was safe but he was anything but i made it clear or i thought i had that i wasnt interested in marrying again i believe im jinxed in that department but warren started on about it and he wouldnt let go i told him to forget it but he kept bringing it up finally we had a big argument and i told him to get out of my house and out of my life he did her voice dropped to a whisper but before he did he beat me up and he raped me when she was able to look at him again she saw him as she had never seen him before his face was dark with anger the little bastard he growled she laid a hand on his arm no neil no its in the past let it stay there ive dealt with it and with him he crawled to get me to do this movie i made him believe me god she said suddenly i dont know why i told you that not that last bit at any rate i have never told anyone about it before dont ever say anything to bob please he doesnt know the whole story it scares me to think what he might do dont worry he assured her i wont do that but if judd ever gives me half an excuse ill beat him bloody she took his hand and squeezed it dont waste your anger ive never had any luck with men for the last ten years ive attracted nothing but maggots she gave a short bitter laugh when that effete little twerp elliott silver made a pass at me last year that was it that was when i decided to give up the species for good v i is this what its going to be like from now on jack mary mcgurk complained looking at her husband as he adjusted the knot of his tie and slipped the narrow end inside the retaining loop is it its my job love its your job to have every weekend ruined she said scornfully its your job to drop everything and go tearing off south even though weve had this party on the kitchen calendar for the last two months its your job to jump every time that man pringle phones he nodded feeling his patience run out yes it wont always be but for now it is she grabbed her jacket from the bed and began to put it on well sod that ill beat you to it im going out youll just have to stay in with the baby fine he shouted at her you do that you just do that you selfish wee bitch go on out and leave me with the kid you know what ill do ill have a uniformed woman constable here inside ten minutes and ill be on my way so yeah go on make your fucking gesture and slam the door on the way out so the bloody neighbours know too she stripped the jacket off again and threw it at him one of the steel buttons caught him just above the eye he felt sharp pain and then a warm trace as a thin line of blood began to run down the side of his face thanks he said coldly ripping a tissue from the box on the dressing table and pressing it to the small wound sorry his wife whispered she sat on the bed her eyes glassy with tears jack she murmured its just not fair he sat beside her no love he agreed its not but dont blame mr pringle and dont blame me if you want to take it out on this man raymond anders hes the guy whos in the frame for bashing that girls head in on thursday now hes been arrested at his sisters house in leeds and pringle and i have to go and get him then bring him up to gala for questioning but couldnt someone else go he shook his head his mouth set tight no this is a murder investigation its down to us to pick this boy up if you want to understand why ill bring home the photographs and let you see them no thanks she retorted i dont want any of that coming into this house but mary im part of that its what i do you dont have to do that you could ask for a transfer back to uniform somewhere in edinburgh not down in the sticks jack mcgurk sighed are we back to that again love we cant stay in edinburgh this is a case in point once were living down there things like this wont be nearly as big a hassle of course they will she snapped itll be worse i dont know anyone down there ill have nothing to do down there ill be like one of your prisoners can you get this through your big thick head i dont want to go to the borders however nice and twee and country bloody casual you try and paint it i want to stay here jack im an edinburgh girl first and foremost he stood up from the bed checking quickly in the mirrored wardrobe door that the cut above his eye had stopped bleeding then he picked up the blazer which earlier he had hung over the back of a chair and slipped it on funny he said as he reached for the door handle i thought we were a couple first and foremost i should be immersing myself in my part you know she told him with mock severity as they headed down the a i should be in the process of turning myself into an edinburgh criminal lawyer as my craft demands i should be spending the day talking to bobs daughter picking up hints and tips from her rather than heading off for a day out in the country with aflatfootlikeyou is that so he drawled point one it was your idea to head out of craiglockhart so that glenys and clarence could indulge in whatever it is young couples like them are supposed to indulge in on sundays personally he offered in an aside i usually watch football on telly with my son point two brilliant and full of promise as ms alexis skinner may be shes a corporate lawyer if you want to splash around or whatever in the realities of the scottish crime scene youre much better off with a career polisman like me cold saturday had continued through the night there was snow all around as they climbed sutra hill but the road was well gritted and wet rather than icy so tell me about it tell me about your lady lawyer neil countered shes a qc for a start shes approached by a friend whose husband has been arrested and charged with murder and she agrees to take the case mcllhenney took a hand from the wheel hold on a minute who wrote the script elliott did in collaboration with a scottish crime novelist theyve dropped a clanger then unless your lady lawyers bent is she louise shook her head no shes a heroine a straight arrow shes broken the rules nevertheless shes not allowed to accept a brief directly from a client shed have to be instructed by a solicitor is that true autographs in the rain of course its bloody true if you want me to be your technical adviser youve got to trust me she turned in her seat and looked at him eagerly would you be our technical adviser i mean like for real he whistled not a chance not officially but from the sound of things you need one alex might not do criminal work herself but she knows plenty of advocates give her a call and shell introduce you to someone but i dont know alex she doesnt know me the big policeman laughed one of the things i like about you louise is that most of the time you forget who and what you are if it makes you feel more comfortable ask the boss to ask her he pointed to his mobile which was clipped into a car adapter call him now if you like no she said you do it for me i dont like to call bob at home sarah was very good when we had dinner the week before last but woman to woman she wont want to hear too much of me youre too sensitive but if you like ill call alex myself and ask her for a couple of introductions theyll be on the payroll yes sure elliott and the writer can pay for her since theyve screwed up hard woman you you better believe it she chuckled whatever crap we talk at oscar time our business is moneydriven im working with warren because i know that together well bring the project in on time and within budget so what happens to the lady lawyer its a complicated script shes intrigued by her client she falls for him in fact as she speaks to the witnesses she becomes more and more convinced that hes been set up she decides to do some freelance investigation of her own stop he cried out dont tell me any more you really need that technical adviser i suppose that all the coppers are bastards too absolutely ah well he laughed thats accurate enough he took the kelso turnoff at carfraemill driving more slowly since the road had been used less heavily than the main trunk route and consequently the surface was less certain eventually he took another turning and headed up a twisting hillside track a few miles on it seemed to peter out he drew up in a deserted parking area okay he said lets see how good those walking boots are they changed into their heavy country footwear and into thick windproof i jackets and gloves what is this place louise asked looking at a fingerpost on the edge of the parking area part of the southern upland way its a walkers route that links the east and west coasts normally it would be busier than this but the snow overnight must have kept folk away thats good she murmured he led her up the track heading east with the sun shining over their shoulders patches of gnarled grass and brown twisted heather showed through the covering of snow and the walkers pathway was still well defined they reached the crest of the first hill after a few minutes and looked around the moorland no trees louise commented surprised no this is the western edge of the lammermuirs if we walked far enough this road would take us to longformacus then to the coast she looked around the rolling land whats that over there she called to him pointing to her right into the distance neil followed the direction of her finger ive never noticed it before but it looks like a trout farm wont the water freeze in weather like this nah they keep it circulating he took a small pair of binoculars from his pocket its beside a small river a tributary of the tweed id guess theyll pump water out of that and through the tanks that looks like quite a big operation he paused and squinted through his fieldglasses again the boys down here have had a lot of trouble with these places just lately he said as he spoke thefts but the most recent one turned very nasty that place looks pretty secure though floodlights highmounted video cameras all they needs a guard on a tower with a machine gun who knows he joked they might have one of them inside that portakabin he put the glasses away and they set off again up the next hill as they stood together at the top louise took his arm can i ask you something neil she said how do you manage to stay as whats the word controlled i suppose dont you ever feel bitter dont you ever feel angry about whats happened to you and the kids she was standing slightly above him on the slope on his eyelevel as he looked at her i tried at first he answered somehow i felt i should i thought about joining a mass action against the tobacco companies until i realised how silly and vindictive that would have been olive smoked when she was a kid because everyone else did including her mother okay the bloody things were advertised but sos beer sos chocolate so are saturated fats sos sex so what would i have got into there suing companies whose shares are probably helping to grow my life insurance policies my isas and my pension fund because my wife exercised her right to choose dont misread me lou i told you yesterday about my nightmare the one about me pegging out while the kids are still young i have others though dark dreams dreams with no conclusion but its the daymares theyre the hardest to cope with there isnt a day in my life goes by without me being back in that consulting room listening to a man who was trying to keep the grief out of his voice as he gave my wife what he knew was a death sentence there isnt a day when im not back in that wee room in the western at the end listening to the click of the diamorphine pump i overcome them by focusing on the positive side of her illness on her determination her cheerfulness the way she never let fear get to the kids not ever on the things we did together on the laughs we had together in the early weeks and months of it at least on her sheer courage lou her sheer unbeatable courage she saw the tears that he was unable to keep from his eyes afterwards he continued not caring about them at first its indescribable what it feels like the numbness where a part of yous been ripped out you wait for the pain to stop eventually the immediacy of it does lessen but you come to terms with the fact that it will always be there as long as you live you come to understand other things too very clearly most of all that two souls became one at the instant you and she met and that although now they may be disjointed that is only a temporary condition only for a while all of us all of the bereft we find our own truth in the midst of our tragedies thats mine i know that one day our two souls will be one again as they were when we were both alive i have nightmares yes but i have a constant vision too one in which olive and i cruise the cosmos together do you believe in god then i believe that we are all god or at least that we are all part of something which for want of a better word weve come to call god or allah or jehovah or that big shiny thing in the sky or whatever autographs in the rain and until that day comes until youre reunited how do you live your life as best i can as happily as i can enjoying my own body while im living in it enjoying my kids as they become adults enjoying their kids however it pans out im not afraid of another relationship i get as horny as the next single man but anyone who becomes involved with me has to understand that one thing is not negotiable she is also going to have to be someone olive would like because shes going to be very close to her abruptly a violent shiver seemed to pass through him hey come on he exclaimed lets get moving or well freeze to the ground he steered her forward down the track one more hill he said then well turnback they trudged on together down then up another crest the steepest of the three they had tackled louise was breathing hard by the time they reached the top neil took a hipflask from another of his pockets and handed it to her whats this she gasped whisky irn bru he grinned i dont drink remember especially not when im driving he watched her as she drank deeply from the flask not daintily from its cup so what about you he asked as she handed it back to him do you have a soulmate she shot him a quick almost furtive glance i think so but his is taken neil was silent for a moment you might be surprised he has a special soul dark and mysterious i suspect but theres a lot of it to go around theres more than one of him thats as well as i can put it he drew a great breath did you mean all that stuff yesterday about giving up men for good sure i did ive been married twice and both times were disasters my other relationships were no better culminating in the episode with warren ive known other women with similar track records and for a while i thought like most of them that all those guys were to blame for not loving us enough then after the last one i tried to put myself in the shoes of all those partners and for the first time it occurred to me that in most cases the bulk f the fault had been mine since i was a young girl i have been obsessed with acting not out of ego at least i dont think so but because i was addicted to it as strongly as an addict is to crack cocaine i have been impossible to live with for any length of time shortterm that was fine people tell me that im goodlooking successful rich and some have even added that im very good in bed any mans dream but as every relationship developed i became more and more remote as my partners quite justifiably i see now wanted more of me than i was prepared or able to give so and when young mr silver whos as sexually interchangeable as anyone ive ever met came on to me it really was the last straw i decided to withdraw from that world she gave her deep throaty laugh that i would have no more of men she murmured that i would live the rest of my days as a garboesque figure alone independent and unto myself that was my clear vision of my declining years was she nodded until when this time louise was standing slightly below him on the hill she looked up at him at his dark hair flecked with grey at his soft blue eyes and the web of lines around them at his oncebroken nose at his expression which to some suggested stolidity but which in fact he had fashioned over the years to mask a developing intellect she took hold of the front of his jacket drew his face down to hers and kissed him lightly on the lips until very recently she whispered pringle and mcgurk had said nothing at all to raymond anders from the time they had collected him from his holding cell in the west yorkshire police headquarters building in leeds until they had installed him in similar accommodation in galashiels they had watched him squirm anxiously seated beside the sergeant in the back of the car they had listened to his occasional pleading question about where they were going and how long the journey would take yet deliberately they had said nothing not one single word now on sunday afternoon refreshed and having gone over the assembled evidence they were ready to begin anders had been formally cautioned by chief superintendent charlie harrison the uniformed divisional commander and advised that he was being held on suspicion of murder he had been advised to call a solicitor and had chosen geoff lesser a formidable high court practitioner from glasgow suspect and solicitor were together when the two policemen walked into the interview room are you two ready to talk to me now asked anders plaintively as they sat down opposite him and loaded the tape recorder pringle made the formal identifications for the record thanks for confirming mr anders he continued with a glance at lesser that weve had no informal discussions with you prior to this interview of the matters under investigation would you just repeat that for the tape that weve said nothing to you until now not a fucking word exclaimed raymond anders he was a tall man but he sat hunched at the table fair hair dull and needing shampoo dandruff on the shoulders of his dark jacket stubble on his long sharp chin thanks thats sufficient said pringle pleasantly do you know why youre here they told me in leeds something to do with the murder of a girl on a trout farm who said anything to you about a trout farm i thought our colleagues in leeds simply detained you in connection with a murder investigation the superintendent caught the quick glance from client to solicitor no point looking at mr lesser he said we havent discussed the case with him either and hes not going to lie to the tape for you so how did you know about the trout farm i guessed i heard it on the car radio that was it which station asked mcgurk radio borders hold on a minute does that mean that your sister was lying to the police when she said that you arrived at her place at just after five on thursday night no i did she was telling the truth in that case said the sergeant prepare to lose your driving licence the news of miss adeys murder wasnt broadcast on radio borders until four thirty its a very local fm station so to hear it you couldnt have been further south than alnwick you must have been doing around two hundred miles an hour to get to your sisters when you did yet still hear that broadcast maybe it was radio scotland then they didnt broadcast the news until just after five and you cant pick them up in leeds congratulations said pringle thats maybe no the fastest opening lie ive ever heard in a formal interview but its up there with the best would you not agree mr lesser the lawyer scowled at him okay the superintendent continued lets cut away the fat and get to the meat of this im going to accept that you got to your sisters when you both say you did where did you leave from hawick thats where my office is right thats a twoandahalfhour drive to leeds minimum in good traffic conditions so you must have been on the road by quarter to three correct anders nodded vigorously starting a small white dandruff storm falling towards the table but you had an appointment with miss adey in her diary in her handwriting timed for four oclock on thursday afternoon more than that youd a date with your girlfriend on thursday night actually son he whispered confidentially i think shes your exgirlfriend now as far as i gather from the boys in leeds your sister and her kids looked autographs in the rain in perfect health so what made you up stakes just like that and bomb off south could it be that after the robbery at country fresh trout went horribly wrong after instead of being blindfolded and tied up in the dark miss adey wound up with her skull smashed in could it be that you panicked and ran for it i dont know anything about her getting killed anders protested i dont know anything about the robberies robberies pringle exclaimed since when have we been talking about more than one robbery no son im interviewing you no the other way around ill get to the others later and then you can get to telling me how you connected them in the meantime jack mcgurk broke in opening the briefcase which he had brought into the room we want you to tell us about this he took out a clear plastic bag and laid it on the table it contained a thick wooden baton around fifteen inches long with a large lead weight set in one end it was blackened and scorched but still clearly identifiable this was found by detective officers when they searched your house in hawick under warrant on friday morning they found it in an old oil drum in your garden shed the sergeant fixed the suspect with an icy look it had been in a fire but forensic examination identified hair blood tissue and bone fragments which were sticking to it as coming from the murder victim mcgurks an angler the superintendent offered he reckons the thing was probably used to kill fish we found the bones of a small trout in a plate in miss adeys kitchen the lassie probably helped herself every so often for her supper her last supper said mcgurk grimly dont be dramatic jack pringle chided he looked at the solicitor in the drum he told him quietly we found the remnants of a large hooded waxed cotton jacket which had been soaked in petrol and set on fire this club which was the murder weapon for sure had been wrapped in it weve got a video tape which we can show you it was taken at night and you cant identify the people in it but we know that one was a tall man in a jacket very like the one which was burned and that the other was miss adey because it shows her murder she tried to defend her employers property with that thing it was taken from her and her skull was bashed in with it thats bad enough in itself for your client now ill get to the other robberies this was the third inside two weeks from a trout farm in the area the total value of the stock stolen being around thirtyfive thousand pounds give or take a few we know that all three thefts were committed by the same gang there are two other linking factors all three farms had very poor security and all three had been visited by your client in failed attempts to sell them video surveillance systems theres one other odd wee fact too the second robbery happened after the resident manager the very large resident manager had been lured away by a bogus call telling him that his father whos recognised as one of hawicks top bevvy merchants had been severely injured on his way home from the pub our man here just happens to drink in the same boozer as mr symonds senior but the licensee told us that he wasnt there that night his girlfriend was but he wasnt i dont think youre going to argue with me if i suggest that the fiscal will support charges of murder and theft against mr anders on the basis of what ive shown and told you no geoff lesser agreed with a heavy sigh im not in fact i propose that you do just that to put mr anders detention on a proper legal footing and to enable me to consult with him properly and at length about his defence ten minutes later the two detectives were back in pringles office anders had been charged formally and left alone with the lawyer that was easier than id thought mcgurk mused aloud i didnt expect that lesser would just roll over like that and let us charge him the neither said the superintendent but i know why he did suppose hed pulled out all the stops and wed bailed anders pro tern the rest of the gang must be feeling pretty insecure right now the boys probably safer in the jail thats what his lawyers thinking maybe mcgurk agreed he was staring at the window absently whats up asked pringle he reached into a compartment of his desk and produced a bottle of whisky and two glasses come on lets have a nip to celebrate he poured two small measures and handed one to the sergeant you still worrying about your wife he asked yes but that wasnt what i was thinking about oh aye yeah i didnt mention this before the interview not just because it autographs in the rain would have muddied the water but because i wanted to be certain now i am that boy anders ive seen him before autographs in the rain hes dead sure of that the head of cid asked he says hes under oath sure and big jacks not a fanciful lad he says that on the afternoon after the howdengate robbery he went to raeburn place on a whim to watch lander and symonds play for jed seconds yes i know karen and i met him in the bar afterwards well dan pringle continued when he was walking across to the pavilion after the game he saw someone go up to lander and speak to him lander answered him then he saw jack broke off his conversation with the other guy straight away and came across to talk to him that other bloke was raymond anders hmm andy martin murmured thats interesting ill grant you im not sure what it tells us if anything but its interesting why should anders show up at raeburn place guys from ha wick are not likely to go up to edinburgh to watch jedforest seconds thats like a parish priest having a season ticket at ibrox whatever the reason is it wants checking into what was lander doing on the night of the robbery his girlfriend he mentioned that he was in bed with her when big symonds phoned him from gala and symonds we know do we that he actually did go to the hospital aye two nurses in the a and e remembered him they said he was in a right state he took some persuading that his father wasnt there after all i wonder if lander has more than one girlfriend or if mercy alvarez gave him an alibi just as she and acc chase gave him one for the night when her farm was done pringle gave a soft hum aye now theres interesting right enough especially said martin since i seem to recall the lady saying to me that she didnt know the other farms that had been robbed dan maybe anders is bang in the frame for this girls murder but we know for sure he didnt act alone theres the footprints and more there were two tanker trucks so that means at least two people no he said sharply at least three on the tape after the girl was killed both trucks drove up at once dan dont get too pleased with yourselves you and mcgurk for nailing anders i understand why you let geoff lesser talk you into charging him at that point and leaving him with him im not as patient as you though not on this i dont just want this guy i want them all the two of you get back in there with your prisoner take the gloves off and lean on him i want names out of him you tell him from me that the crown office will press for every day he holds out on us to become another year added on to the judges recommendation on the minimum sentence he serves before parole if he wants to be out of jail before hes fifty hed better talk to you all right sir murmured pringle with a sigh can it really not wait till tomorrow though the boys locked up and jacks just about to go on up the road hes having problems at home he added marys no happy about the move tonight dan i sympathise with mcgurk but unless you can find someone else experienced to sit in with you its down to him if he likes ill ask karen to talk to his wife and you and i can see what we can do but i want anders leaned on and i want it done now the head of cid paused oh and just in case you think im copping out im about to delight mrs martin by spending the rest of my sunday night digging up insurance company managers i intend to find out the total insurance loss on all three farms whats wrong she asked have i been too pushy or have i just made a total fool of myself she looked at his profile in the faint green light of the cars instrument panel smiling as he gave a small involuntary shudder as if he had just switched off his auto pilot im sorry lou he said i was miles away there i asked you whether i had upset you back there on the moor will i find myself with a new minder tomorrow christ no he exclaimed youve stunned me thats all you took my breath away i mean what brought it on i dont know for sure she answered laughing softly to herself but thinking back i remember wondering whether maybe for all my adult life the man ive been looking for is the sort who puts irn bru in a hip flask shh for a minute he said lets pull in somewhere for a bite and damn the punters we cant talk about this in the car after they had climbed down from the moor their circular route had taken them through kelso duns and on to the al at grantshouse neil looked at the road signs and saw that east linton was only half a mile ahead he turned off the single carriageway trunk road into the halfhidden village drove across the tyne bridge and pulled up close to the drovers inn happily the roadhouse was quiet and they were shown straight to a table for two in the dining room upstairs they ordered a glass of white wine for louise a bottle of sparkling mineral water and two seafood platters with side salad then sat silently as the wine was poured and the bottle opened she smiled at him mischievously as he took his first sip like i said he began tm stunned gobsmacked i dont know what to think and i sure dont know what to say other than this i find you very attractive but im not talking about the autographs in the rain publicity photo or the face up on the big screen youre beautiful on the inside lou and thats where it counts but what i dont understand is what the hell you can see in a big dumb polisman like me given the world you live in with all these bloody superstars and everything she ran the tip of her right index finger round the rim of her glass which lay untouched on the table much the same thing i havent felt the faintest flicker of attraction for a man in the last three years although she smiled again my line of work being what it is i have had a few propositions put to me youre not like anyone ive met not in a while not for as long as i want to remember youre a warm openhearted caring man and you are not in the slightest affected by who i am or by the person im supposed to be nor by any other of those bloody superstars if it comes to it you see through all that when you look at me i can tell youre just looking at louise bankier from bearsden and thats all i am he shook his head not all its who you are and its enough maybe im afraid to look at the face up on the big screen maybe she would overwhelm me no you look through her to get to me you just strip her away so what are you saying what are you asking are you asking anything i dont know im afraid to say any more than i have and i dont know what to ask of you i do know this though i mustnt trifle with you you dont deserve any more hurt in your life and i certainly wont be the one to inflict it you couldnt he told her not you its not in you to hurt me or anyone else anyway im beyond hurt now beyond any hurt i can imagine at least ive found my truth my certainty and thats my shield but what about the loneliness does your shield protect against that he looked at her for a while without replying spinning his glass in his fingers watching the bubbles in the water as if he was considering something finally he laid it down let me tell you a story a true story true as im sitting here in the days and weeks after olive died i experienced certain physical things signs youd call them of her presence around me on another plane the very diy after in fact i lay down on the sofa alone and closed my eyes for the first time in over twentyfour hours as i lay there i felt a line of pressure above my eyes firm yet not painful not like a headache i knew that it was her i knew instinctively that part of her essential being we use the word soul and its as good as any other was merging with mine binding us together a few weeks after that i had a dream i was drawn towards and eventually came to a bridge i could see her on the other side but i couldnt cross she knew i was there she wasnt smiling but she was content that i could see i knew then that she had brought me there the bridge was grey and so was everything around but i knew also that when i can cross ill see colours the like of which ive never imagined she made as if to speak but he held up a hand to stop her no he said softly thats not the story a few months later the big man insisted that i take the kids and go off to his place in spain for a couple of weeks so we went out there and lay beside the pool and went to the beach and all the time i felt this great space around me empty yet not empty then one night i was lying in bed in bob and sarahs guest room asleep and dreaming about olive all of a sudden i woke up he snapped his fingers suddenly making her jump abruptly just like that there was someone there lying beside me it was her she was there in my arms we couldnt speak either of us we just hugged and we cried then after im not sure how long more than a couple of seconds anyway she just faded melted away leaving me alone but with a huge feeling of relief i lay there for a while until eventually i went back to sleep back into the dream from which id awakened but next morning it was all still there as clear as it had been at the time now i know lou that inevitably youre sitting there thinking the poor man or some such and that it was all part of the same dream yet what ive told you is as pure a truth as i can give you just like you ive had many dreams bad ones good ones dark ones bright ones aye even wet ones when i was a teenager but ive never ever had a dream that i could touch ive never before or since had a dream that cried on my shoulder and neither ill bet have you she looked at him unaware of the tears in the corners of her eyes and shook her head olive told me many things in that wordless encounter he continued most of all though she told me to be patient that it would take as long as autographs in the rain it took but that it would be all right until then she was letting me go to get on with my life he frowned why did i tell you this yes the loneliness there is none not any more it left me that night i find the patience part of it difficult from time to time but when i do the kids are there to get me back on track so dont you worry about hurting me love its the other way round given what youve been through its me who has to worry about hurting you as you said earlier she told him you couldnt if you tried its not in you his eyebrows rose as he topped up his water glass are you so sure i know enough about your career to remember that a while back you won an award for wuthering heights back there on the moor dont you think you might have been replaying the role he grinned imagine me as heathcliff she laughed a suppressed giggle at first until it escaped into a long peal of beautiful sound not for a minute she exclaimed more glaswegian than he had ever heard her and loud enough for two other diners to turn and look towards their table heathcliff didnt even carry a hipflask far less fill it with ginger geoff lesser was not a happy man he glared at pringle as the two came ijacetoface in the divisional hqs reception area i was halfway back to glasgow he complained what the hells this about lets just say weve had a change of heart the superintendent growled weve decided to offer your boy a deal but itll be take it or leave it and itll be now im sorry to mess you about but the legal aid pay for it as always yes said lesser with a hint of a grin but slowly as always but what do you mean a deal my client denies all charges strenuously he can get as strenuous as he fucking likes strenuousness does not impress juries and you know it they expect strenuousness theyre impressed by evidence and on the basis of that anders is on the peterhead bus already ah but he will say that someone could have burned that coat and that baton in his shed someone who wanted to frame him for the robberies as you rightly said he had visited all three farms in the course of his everyday visits and in attempting to sell them his systems had himself pointed out to the managers their vulnerability to the type of theft which was subsequently committed what appears to be evidence for the crown is in fact evidence for the defence pringle nodded amiably time will tell sir let me guess he continued i suppose he did a runner after he received an anonymous telephone call warning him that the police would be after him for the girls murder very good superintendent youve worked out what happened oh that i have mr lesser that i have come on and lets see what the poor victim of miscarried justice has to say about it the detective led the way back to the interview room where jack mcgurk and a uniformed constable were sitting silently with raymond anders the room was blue with cigarette smoke right pringle barked at the prisoner you can put that out right now it took me long enough to give up ill be buggered if ill indulge your habit he snatched the cigarette from the mans hand and ground it out in the ashtray which lay on the table he switched on the tape this is a resumed interview with raymond anders by detective superintendent pringle and detective sergeant mcgurk mr geoff lesser solicitor also being present prisoner remains under caution he looked at the constable and jerked a thumb towards the door you can go son right anders he began setting himself down on a chair this afternoon was the ritual dancin this is the serious stuff now youre cooked for this and no messing since we saw you this afternoon the technicians have found blood remnants on a scrap of the coat you burned i didnt burn it the prisoner protested someone else must have this is after you had the anonymous call that caused you to do a runner anders eyes narrowed slightly yes it must have been it would have been the same bloke likely ah said mcgurk speaking for the first time a bloke with a set of keys to your house no of course not son pringle sighed the jacket and the club were burned in an oil drum inside your garden shed that was a daft thing to do but i suppose you didnt want the neighbours to see you however he looked at lesser and let out a great bellowing laugh it wasnt nearly as fucking daft as locking the shed door after youd done it the solicitor stared up at the ceiling dont piss us about any longer raymond we didnt press you on this this afternoon because we hoped that mr lesser might have persuaded you that the smart thing to do would have been to name your accomplices im sure he suggested it to you but youve taken the stupid option give you one chance here tell me who else was in on the robberies i cant promise this but i might be able to persuade the crown office to accept a plea of guilty to the robberies alone if you name your accomplices in ourt as things stand you and you alone are going away for life the anders was as white as his solicitors shirt but he shook his head prisoner declines to answer said mcgurk to the tape look son said pringle be sure of what youre facing here this is a autographs in the rain autographs in the rain brutal murder committed in the furtherance of theft theres no chance of this being talked down to culpable homicide this will be a life sentence the crown wont leave it at that though they will ask the judge to throw the book at you with a minimum sentence recommendation that will make you an old old man by the time you come out mind you you might not want to come out by then you might fancy settling down with a nice bloke for the next twentyfive years i never killed her anders screamed raymond his solicitor warned but in vain i never touched the woman i swear it i was waiting in one of the trucks when she was done what about the coat and the bludgeon mcgurk asked harshly i was given them to bum by whom pringle barked superintendent lesser interjected i must advise my client to say no more thats the last thing you should advise him geoff and you know it now answer the question who gave you the coat and club to burn i cant tell you i never knew his name bollocks who was it cant tell you mcgurk grabbed his shoulder and turned him to face him was it glenn lander whos he anders bleated you know him you met him the day after his farm was robbed i think you arranged to see him at raeburn place to tell him that the robbery had gone fine anders looked at him in astonishment and the sergeant knew that he had hit the mark the prisoner turned desperately to his solicitor i want to go back to my cell sir he pleaded raymond said lesser solemnly at this stage it may be in your interests to cooperate i want to go back to my cell the lawyer shook his head very well he looked across at pringle this interview is over gentlemen i might as well tell you geoff the superintendent said as he switched off the tape that the boy really did a bad job of burning that stuff he says he didnt kill the girl but he did manage to leave part of the baton untouched by the fire and weve got his palmprint off it hell be in court for remand tomorrow morning as per the usual routine youve got till then to persuade him to change his mind the alarm buzzed once its red signal light flashed once but neil mcllhenney was not asleep his right hand flashed out and hit the cancel button inside a second in the same movement he swung out of bed snatched up his jeans sweater and shoes from the floor slipping silently into the trousers not bothering about underwear or socks as he slipped out into the hall there he unlocked his desk with a key on his chain took out a glock automatic pistol and slipped it into a pocket of his heavy outdoor jacket as he pulled it on over his sweater he left the house within a minute of the alarms warning having made barely a sound he ran down colinton road as quickly as he could safely manage in moccasins on the slippery pavement and turned into craiglockhart avenue skidding to a halt as a red glow behind the houses close by told him the reason for the emergency signal as he broke into a run once more he heard a car crashing gears screeching tyres then the roar of an engine as it sped away into the night twenty yards down the avenue he slipped and fell thanking his lucky stars that the glock was on safe as he landed on it he ignored the sharp pain pushed himself to his feet and ran on until he reached the culdesac where louises rented home stood he had made it in less than three minutes yet the house was an inferno the front door was consumed and through it he could see that the wildfire had spread almost instantly along the acrylic hall carpet and up the varnished wooden staircase which led to the two attic bedrooms whatever had happened it had been so sudden so cataclysmic that none of the neighbours had yet been awakened nor as far as he could see or hear had anyone in the house he took out his mobile and keyed in the direct number of the torphichen place office where the backup alarm was situated it was answered quickly this is mcllhenney he snapped theres a fire at the house major outbreak all available appliances at once autographs in the rain ambulances the whole fucking shooting match as he ended the call he saw to his horror a figure appear in one of the bedroom windows it was glenys algodon she was naked silhouetted by the flames behind her as she struggled with the handle of the doubleglazed window unit he held his breath as he watched her knowing that there was nothing he could do no one else he could call who would help at last the window swung open on its central hinge as it did so he heard her screams for the first time and saw the blaze behind her fuelled by the inrush of air reaching out as if to feed on her get out he bellowed on to the roof then jump he vaulted the steel driveway gate into the garden and ran for the bungalow now glenys ill catch you she did as he said and slithered still screaming out of the halfopened window then rolled over tongues of flame which were already licking through the tiles down and off the roof he reached her but only in time to break her fall her weight sent him sprawling beside her on the lawn she rolled around still screaming with her hair on fire he beat it out with his bare hands then dragged her as far away from the house as he could noticing as he did so that her back and buttocks had been turned into one large blister by the heat he held her firmly face down talking to her soothing her until her screams turned to whimpers and stopped finally as she slipped into a daze he took off his heavy jacket slipping the gun into the waistband of his jeans and his mobile into a pocket and covered her gently as he did so he heard an indignant scared voice behind him what are you doing it demanded mcllhenney turned to see a middleaged man in dressinggown and pyjamas peering down at him over the garden wall im having a fucking barbecue he roared what did you think the man recoiled are you a neighbour the policeman snapped nod yes next door well get back in there bring me a blanket or something like it then make a strong cup of tea for the young lady no for you the young lady will be going off in an ambulance in a minute when she does im going to want to talk to you as he spoke the first fire appliance swung round the corner into the cul desac siren silent but blue lights flashing go on the detective shouted more kindly to the neighbour get me that blanket now the firemen did not see him at first as he crouched by glenys instead they cleared the locked driveway gate as he had done hoses connected to the nearest hydrants playing water on the roof and shooting it at the front door behind them another appliance arrived then as the neighbour appeared with a travelling rug an ambulance mcllhenney wrapped glenys carefully in the blanket then stood and waved to the paramedics as they ran across a whitehelmeted figure jumped from the second fire engine spotting the policeman as he did neil do matt grogan called out what the hell are you doing here i live round the corner ill speak to you later ill want to know how and where this started as the veteran firefighter strode towards the blaze the detective helped the ambulance crew as they lifted the casualty and placed her still face downwards on a stretcher she was still dazed but as they lifted her over the low wall she looked at him sideways and he could see that she was numb with horror clarence louise she whispered and then her eyes glazed over once more oh jesus mcllhenney murmured feeling himself shivering but not from the cold of the night he took his handphone from his pocket and dialled a familiar number as always the man on the other end was wide awake although the call was answered on only the second ring yes neil skinner said quietly and evenly his bedside phone had a readout which identified incoming numbers and sometimes callers what is it he knew that at am the call would not be trivial tm at louises place boss theres a fire its still burning but the place is gutted my alarm went off and i got here double quick but it was well alight by then matt grogans here hopefully hell give us an idea of how it happened and skinner did not have to say more glenys got out boss a bit scorched but shell be okay im afraid for clarence sparrow her boyfriend i thought he was catching the last shuttle home to london but louise man louise did she get out mcllhenney took a deep breath lou was never in the house boss she was with me with you skinners exec heard the astonishment in his voice did you have her up for dinner again he asked it was the first time in autographs in the rain mcllhenneys life he had ever heard him ask anything remotely like a stupid question no boss she was asleep when i left her there was a long silence yet during it the two men seemed to say things to each other things which were for life then youd better go and tell her whats happened the dcc said at last ive got to have a word with the neighbours boss and with grogan they can wait until i get there no off you go and see louise you dont want her to be waking up and wandering down there looking for you so clarence was still there said lou she was sitting on neils sofa her hands wrapped around a mug of coffee her eyes were red and blotchy she wbre no makeup her hair was tangled and she was dressed in a teeshirt and neils black towelling dressinggown but she was still beautiful yes love he said quietly since the last time we saw them he must have decided to stay the extra night and clearly from what she said to me glenys assumed that youd come back in after theyd gone to bed she leaned against him her head on his shoulder as she would she murmured she slipped a hand warm from the mug into his and squeezed it you were right love theres someone watching over us he pressed his face against her kissing her hair never doubt it he whispered in her ear it was as if for that moment there was no one else in the room a fact that was not lost on bob skinner and andy martin as they stood in front of the fireplace eventually mcllhenney remembered their presence sorry boss this situations become a bit well unprofessional i suppose who gives a damn said skinner with a quick look that put his assistant at his ease because it did lou wasnt in that house and thank god for it but poor clarence was she reminded him he winced yes poor clarence matt grogan said that they found him in the bedroom doorway hes seen similar before the victims in bed hears these funny noises outside hes halfasleep and opens the door to investigate whoosh the fireballs sucked in and hes right in the middle of it ms algodon was lucky she got out does matt have any theory about how it started asked martin yes the dcc answered and a pretty good one at that the perpetrator climbed over the driveway gate walked up the concrete path to the front door knowingly or otherwise avoiding triggering the geophones we put autographs in the rain me garden and put three cans of petrol up against it then he put detonators in each one he glanced at his two colleagues know what matt thinks he used big firework rockets one in each can he linked the three fuses together with a single petrolsoaked cord lit the blue touchpaper and withdrew effing sharpish the explosion would have been soft probably not enough to wake the neighbours unless they were sleeping with the windows open unlikely in december however it would have blown the front door in triggering your alarm neil and torching the place in seconds you took how long to get there he asked mcllhenney under three minutes nevertheless that would have been enough for the blaze to have been impenetrable even without the second explosion what second explosion boss i never heard anything no it would have happened seconds after the first there was a box of highly inflammable aerosols in the hall they gave the fire a sort of turbo charged effect according to grogan he looked at louise any idea what they might have been she nodded back at him yes they were hair spray were due to start filming this morning and since were shooting in street locations i had arranged for the makeup person to call at the house first thing and fix me up there who dropped them off asked andy martin quietly who knew they were there louise looked up at him for a few seconds theyve been lying there since thursday elliott silver brought them with him when he arrived for our meeting i remember telling him just to leave them in the hallway this is the same guy mcllhenney exclaimed who tried his hand with lou a while back and got sent down the road but neil she protested twisting round to look at him but what love tell me something does he have a car here or does he travel by taxi he has a hire car why because when i was running down craiglockhart avenue i heard a motor taking off sharpish skinner looked at martin talk to him andy have a serious talk with him wheres he living lou hes renting a flat in the new town on india street in fact where were due to begin filming this morning youll find his address in my filo in the hall you better postpone that your director could be busy for a bit til call warren hes in the george hotel dont worry about that skinner assured her ill call in on him myself meantime he continued what are we going to do with you maybe we should move you into a hotel suite no mcllhenney retorted lou stays here but neil she said what about the kids theyll be fine he looked at the dcc anyway we may wind up locking up mr silver before the days out he frowned but even if we dont were finished pissing about now boss arent we too right said skinner if lou is going to stay with you then we make this a fortress armed officers front and back from now on round the clock spence and lauren get taken to school and brought back by car he paused better still they can come to ours its near the end of the school term so a couple of weeks or so at gullane primary with mark wont harm them at all deal said neil looking at lou you okay with that love she hesitated im okay with it except for one thing i dont want to put you in danger he laughed try and keep me out of it okay boss he said to skinner pushing himself up from the sofa ill keep the kids off school this morning theyll think its christmas come early fine ill pick them up this afternoon unless silver confesses everything which you dont think he will asked mcllhenney quietly skinner drew in his breath in a familiar hiss no i dont he admitted if it was him then delivering those aerosols personally was a stupid thing to do and this boy hasnt done a single stupid thing so far apart from persecuting lou in the first place mcllhenney growled that will turn out to have been very stupid indeed the dcc agreed moving towards the door with martin and taking a shot at me even if it was a blank that too right andy he said as mcllhenney saw them into the small hall youll brace silver right away the head of cid nodded yup ill have to postpone my divisional autographs in the rain heads meeting this morning anyway dan pringles in court with the guy we nailed for the fish farm jobs mmm said mcllhenney idly we saw one of them yesterday on the edge of the moors just off the carfraemill to kelso road a big one it was too with a video security system youll be glad to hear martin stared at him is that so he murmured dan pringle showed me a list of all the trout farms on his patch and im dead certain there wasnt one there autographs in the rain policemen are used to being wakened from their slumber in the middle of the night to be told of catastrophe disaster and death film producers on the whole are not warren judd looked a bundle of nerves as he perched on a chair in his balmoral hotel suite sipping black coffee from a jug provided by room service he was shivering not from the cold for the room was warm but from nerves do you know how the fire started he asked his voice shaky were still in the realms of theory said skinner truthfully i wont speculate but you do know that that man glenyss partner is dead his name was clarence sparrow and if he isnt dead hes a bloody phoenix it was the policemans turn to shudder as he recalled what matt grogan had shown him under that tarpaulin glenys algodon got out by the skin of her teeth and of her back shell be in a lot of pain and discomfort for the next few days and shell have a new hairdo for a while but she will be all right and ms bankier definitely wasnt there youre sure about that i mean if the fire was that bad mr judd the dcc said slowly i have spoken to louise she is shocked but in good health why wasnt she there where was she we start shooting tomorrow it isnt like her to have late nights while shes working she had a dinnerdate she hadnt got back when the fire started dinner date with whom skinner frowned as he looked at the producer sensing old passions old jealousy within him but he sensed nothing else with neil her bodyguard he told him abruptly they went out for the day they had supper and then they went back to his place judds cup slipped in his fingers spilling coffee on to the balmorals expensive carpet she he whispered the dcc stared at him hard neils a fine man he murmured evenly one of the very best of people as is louise as louise has always been as she was when i knew her first when you were not as much as a black cloud on the far horizon she deserves someone like him and if you ever grudge her that mister or reproach her or wish her anything but the very best of luck then in neil mcllhenney and me you will have made two of the worst enemies that a man could possibly have but who is he judd croaked hes a policeman hes my executive assistant lous been under our discreet protection since shes been in edinburgh she has a stalker a persecutor before tonight there have been two incidents one in london and one in edinburgh neither was a lethal attack tonights was were looking for a slimbuilt man in his late twenties who signs himself john steed in emails but whose name that quite certainly is not what about my movie the producer exclaimed are you shutting me down skinner grinned whether i would or wouldnt do that is academic your coproducer wont have it and thats that youre going to lose today while we make revised security arrangements for louise but you should be able to start shooting tomorrow however from now on no one is going to know where louise is staying neither you nor your director nor the costars not even glenys when she recovers that knowledge stays within my team til also be putting a man on set so that no one can boobytrap any of your props youll be responsible for checking everybody on set you see one unfamiliar face you shout bloody murder judd nodded his head whatever you say boss ill call the unit manager right now and tell him to stand everyone down for twentyfour hours we can reschedule and make up the loss over the next couple of weeks the only days i cant change are the hogmanay street party stuff but thats wild footage doesnt involve the cast and next saturday and sunday weve got the okay to shoot the big closing scene in parliament hall we set up overnight friday so we can film both days if necessary thats fine no worries there theres only one other thing youre going to have to do telly have been to the fire scene already and the press will be all over it very soon so my media manager is going to have to issue a statement confirming that theres been a fatality sparrows parents will be advised of his death first thing in the morning once thats done i want you to issue a statement expressing regret and explaining that the house was occupied by members of your production team including louise bankiers assistant you should add that lou is shocked by clarences death and by glenyss injury in this tragic accident you can lie in your statement i cant he left the producer in his suite to come to terms with everything that had happened and to begin revising his schedule elliott silvers address had been easy to find louise bankier was one of those traditionalists who still carried a filofax rather than an electronic notebook and like all filofreaks she updated hers daily and took it with her everywhere she went neil mcllhenney found it without difficulty scribbled it on a clean page in the notes section and handed it to andy martin as he was leaving martin enjoyed driving through the empty streets of the city at night listening to the frying sound of the tarmac beneath the wide tyres of his mgf driving fast through lights which normally were blocked with daytime traffic he zipped through holy corner and bruntsfield on into lothian road and past the new office blocks which had changed edinburghs skyline in recent years finally taking the unnecessarily complicated route which led him to india street elliott silver had made his temporary home on the basement level of a tall grey tenement building he parked in the street outside looked around the other vehicles until he found a mercedes aclass with the rental company tag still hanging from the rearview mirror he laid a hand on the hood but it told him nothing it was cold the head of cid trotted down the steps checking his watch as he went am the man should be well asleep he murmured to himself as he rang the doorbell there was no answer not until the third ring eventually the bluepainted door swung open framing a leggy blonde woman wrapped in a silk dressinggown backlit and made transparent by the hall yes she snapped what the hell is it wheres the fire craiglockhart he said but its out now he flashed his warrant card dcs martin edinburgh cid i want to see mr silver is he in whats up grade a sleepy mans voice sounded from the depths of the hall is it some drunk cos if it is its the police mr silver martin called out then the man stepped into view and he recognised him even unshaven in boxer shorts a face from a quintin jardine hundred screens and many more magazine covers that of ralph annand louises costar unbidden martin stepped into the hall elliott silver he repeated im told hes living here is that true and if so is he here yes the third voice came from the bedroom door a man fair hair tousled leaning naked against its jamb im elliott now what the fuck do you want as little as i can get away with martin replied his legendary patience wearing thin where were you between midnight and two oclock vhere in bed okay he turned to the woman thumb jerked towards annand him i know who are you grade annand she replied ralphs wife right his green gaze flashed back to the director so whos to say you didnt slip out were you in bed alone elliott silver gave a long bored sigh and shook his head so who else is here no one mr policeman but you werent in bed alone no it was andy martins turn to sigh okay he asked which one silver flashed him a wicked triumphant smile both of them mr policeman shocked to the core sunshine said the detective to the very core now go and get some kit on all of you and get your sore and sorry arses back in here because its my turn to shock you skinners car stood outside the balmoral no obstruction to traffic since it was only just after five he thought about driving home but saw no point in wakening sarah or the baby earlier than necessary and so instead he drove down towards fettes stopping only to pick up a couple of filled rolls in an allnight cafe in stockbridge the night security staff came to something approaching attention as he parked in his reserved space opening the door for him before he reached it tiredness was beginning to catch up with him as he unlocked his office he debated whether to grab a couple of hours sleep on the couch or to attack the rolls instead his mind made up he switched on the coffee filter which stood ever ready in the corner the bread was fresh from the bakers oven not too well fired buttered and filled with egg mayonnaise he ate them with pleasure and chased them with strong coffee then looked around how many mornings like this bob he asked himself aloud caught in limbo in the nothing hours nothing happening nothing to do but think too many especially in the time between myra and sarah christ in the time between sarah and sarah i was worried about big neil too facing the same thing then he goes and surprises the shit out of me him and lou fucking big dark horse that he is lets hope eh he looked around feeling suddenly selfconscious as if there was a chance that someone might catch the dcc talking to himself in the night suddenly a thought caught him and he laughed quietly not so daft a notion with chase around he opened the deep drawer of his desk better just check to see if hes hiding in here and then he noticed the small table beside his desk the bank of telephones on top and on the second shelf beneath the fax his private secure fax with a plastic tray suspended from it a tray that was no longer empty intrigued glad to have something to do he took the message from its holder and scanned it there was a cover sheet headed private eyes only above an impressive crest bald eagle surrounded by the legend national security council of the united states of america which was followed in its turn by a second line from the office of the deputy chair skinner grinned as he pictured his old friend joe doherty whom he had known since his days as fbi resident in london before a college buddy had become president and set him on the road to greatness he saw his thin lined sallow face the slimness of his build which made him seem smaller than his five feet nine as he began to read he heard his midwestern drawl when he had finished the threepage message he put it down with a faint tinge of excitement he reached out for his outside line then stopped considering finally he exclaimed aloud once more to the ghosts in the room ah bugger it why should i be awake and him asleep the boys got to learn he took a card from his wallet where he had tucked it away picked up the phone and dialled david mackenzies mobile number as he had expected the strathclyde di was too good a copper too keen too inquisitive too scared to miss out on anything to switch off his hand phone while he slept or to divert calls to the night shift after a few rings a sleepy voice came on the line mumbling a hello bandit its dcc skinner glad youre awake sir its the voice slurred thats right its quarter to six say sorry to your wife for me then go downstairs get a great big notepad and call me back on the number i gave you he hung up the telephone and waited looking at the second hand on his watch one minute and twelve seconds later the phone rang he grabbed it grinning good man he exclaimed its going to be worth it i promise how are you getting on with old man mcconnell slowly someone in the scotrail office is looking into his record for me but shes doing it grudgingly and bloody slowly i doubt if shell come up with anything fuck her is that an order sir because if its all the same to you skinner chuckled okay just forget her for a while ive got a new tack for you one that will awake your basest instincts remember i said a few days back that id do some brainstorming of my own well listen to me and ill tell you what ive been up to he raced on autographs in the rain what do we know about the late john mcconnell one he was a keen golfer irrelevant to your investigation two he was a dirty old man possibly relevant to your investigation three he was apparently into jellies highly relevant to your investigation four someone ripped him off for most of his liquid assets again highly relevant to your investigation five hes dead the reason for your investigation agreed yes sir said mackenzie wide awake now good so lets join the dots forget the golf thats nothing what we have is a young woman who by some means or another gets this old geezer hooked on drugs the means well hes an old lecher with a penchant for the young stuff so join those dots up too she feeds his addiction but at a cost over a period of a few months he gives her all his money she withdraws it posing as his niece also she sells his prize possessions and does a runner with that money too were talking a total ripoff in excess of one hundred thousand finally shes got the lot so one day she turns up feeds him a final shot and while hes orbiting around venus immerses him in a scalding bath and drowns him are you in any doubt inspector that thats how it happened no sir none at all which leaves us with that video camera why the hell did she take that video camera with her on that last visit one reason only to make a movie and why the hell skinner asked would she do that because shes a fruitcake mackenzie exclaimed maybe she is maybe she isnt ive met a lot of fruitcakes in my career son and all but a very few of them had a purpose behind the things they did so i continue to ask why did she film the old boy well need to find her to find that out wont we ah but bandit maybe by finding out well find her that brainstorming ive been doing has focused on that listen he said urgently young girl old man dirty old man home movies its porn beyond a doubt its a porno movie but add in the drugs element and you take it up a notch not just sex but sadomasochism finally add in the fact that the old man winds up dead is your blood running cold yet bandit because it should i have a friend in the states who has access to just about everything including fbi investigations into the pornography industry were way behind the column in britain in that area sure were good at catching the sort of dirty bastards who collect kiddie pics but theres all sorts of stuff going on that we dont have a clue about the americans do the fbi wage a real war on it but there are places where even they cant go the cia have been involved as well and even they cant cap it pornography has moved on from the corner shop way way on its a major internet industry now and it shows just what a dangerous thing the net can be there are all sorts of sites that can be accessed easily some of them offer membership some of them just oneoff sales but they all involve money collected through credit cards you imagine it and you can find it and with the right kit and enough credit in your account you can download it guys like us might lock you up if youre caught but you wont be the softer of these sites are tolerated the hardest might not be but they cant be stopped either because they operate outside regulation outside the us outside europe in south america in the far east in asia in bandit country sometimes they move their administration around from place to place that includes the accounts always hard to spot through which they collect their dough potentially the money in it is better than drugs and easier skinner paused still with me all the way said mackenzie breathlessly okay this is it at the very end of the pornography industry there exists something so awful we dont even like to think about it the snuff movie a film which is the ultimate in sexosadism a film in which the torture and death on screen are not simulated they are real theyve been around for a while of course since back before the video days made mostly in south america but with todays technology he paused letting the suggestion strike home so bandit what if just what if mind the lady with the video camera was making a snuff movie with old john mcconnell as the star why sir why the inspector exclaimed maybe you said it yourself fruitcake but remember on the internet you can upload to a site as well as download from it he took a sup from his cold coffee i cant answer any more whys but heres another what if what if this woman didnt make any mistakes she autographs in the rain couldnt have known that the old dear across the road would eyeball her taking the camera into the house so what if by taking the syringe with her and leaving the cassette box she was leaving us a message jesus bandit mackenzie whispered what sort of a mind do you have i ask myself that sometimes i suspect its much like your own its been around longer thats all so its more experienced in contemplating evil he went on quickly so back to my friend in the states hes come up with a list of potential websites the sort of net location where one finds extreme pornography what i suggest you do inspector suggest mind ive got sod all to do with this investigation is get yourself a computer with a modem and get looking but be sure you use a mainstream connection if you try to log on through the strathclyde police computer address you might just find yourself blocked out the dcc chuckled again you got that pen handy yes sir good here you are then i hope you have plenty of paper its a long list so hes not talking not a cheep andy not a dickybird i talked to him right up to the moment he went up before the sheriff and geoff lesser went as far as he could to persuade the lad to turn crown evidence but he was having none of it so he went into court the charges murder and theft were read out he made no plea and he was remanded in custody hell be in saughton by now honour among fish rustlers dyou think maybe but more likely terror i think that hes just plain scared of someone another member of the gang andy martin heaved a sigh maybe after hes been locked away from them for a week or two hell start to feel braver tell lesser that theres a deal on the table well drop the murder charge in exchange for names in the witness box well also ensure that he never spends a single day in the same prison as another gang member that will be open to him until we catch the rest of the gang ourselves with indictable evidence against them til tell him said dan pringle he looked at the head of cid christ andy man you look knackered i feel it the dcs confessed ive been up most of the bloody night karen no sleeping is she that was the night before last no weve got an operation going up in edinburgh and it took a bad turn on us i wound up rousting three unsavoury citizens out of their bed and i mean bed at about half four have you not been home since martin grinned sure but by that time karen was awake and being sick she no over that yet not quite im told we go on to cravings next spam and mango pizzas at two in the morning that sort of thing autographs in the rain not necessarily with my wife it was just baked beans but they can bring problems of their own especially in the winter when ye canna sleep with the windows open anyway said the head of cid steering the discussion back on to professional lines with one thing and another i decided to scrub the monday briefing altogether and come down to gala to see you instead give me a stateofplay report on the fish farm investigations pringle nodded sure but let me get mcgurk in he stepped out of his office for a few seconds and returned with the beanpole sergeant following behind right sir he began the story so far we have raymond anders in custody and charged he denies killing the girl but admits to driving one of the trucks at the alvarez place we have mercy alvarez spending the night on which her farm was raided in bed with glenn lander after having dinner with assistant chief constable chase and mrs chase who stayed long enough to clear them of any possible involvement in the robbery we have glenn lander spending the night on which his farm was raided in bed with mercy alvarez having entertained another cousin until just after midnight we have raymond anders making contact with glenn lander at raeburn place on the afternoon after his farm was done we believe to tell him that the stock had been moved successfully we have the robbery taking place the day before anders was due to meet kath adey to sell her a security system we have the gang going along to country fresh prepared to restrain and blindfold the girl only for her to be killed when she fights back martin nodded yes to all those weve got anders and through jacks sighting at the accies match a strong link to glenn lander now why was no apparent attempt made to lure adey away from the farm i suggest that it was because they knew she wouldnt go because i had given her and mercy alvarez a very clear warning that she should not so they didnt even try they cut her telephone line instead so she couldnt raise the alarm what if she had a mobile asked mcgurk they dont work in that gully someone knew that too i have no doubt that it was the same person who knew that it was pointless trying to get her to leave strong link number two mercy alvarez who told me that she didnt know the other fish farms that had been robbed two out of three said pringle yes now what of the third what about mellerkirk how does that connect it doesnt sir martin looked at mcgurk as he spoke theres no connection between lander or alvarez and sir adrian watson not one that ive been able to make at any rate oh there is a connection jack a very clear one weve all been thinking in terms of maybe ten or twelve grand apiece as the proceeds of these robberies in other words okay but maybe not worth killing over however the insured losses in each of the three farms are mellerkirk thirty thousand howdengate forty thousand and country fresh forty thousand total one hundred and ten thousand pounds spread over three different insurers so it doesnt show up too fast what do you have three businesses operating on the edge of profitability anyone who steals their fish is actually doing them a favour for they can restock with the insurance lift and still have a tidy sum left to reinvest or reduce debt or whatever of course if theyre stealing their own fish themselves theyre doing even better arent they they are indeed pringle agreed were pretty close to nailing lander and alvarez now all we need to do is tie in that bastard watson if it is him martin countered adrian watsons worth about seven million quid cash on top of that he owns the estate and he has two fucking botticellis hanging on his walls what the hells he doing involved in a thirtygrand insurance scam especially one with murder involved his fish are worth stealing though especially he stopped in mid sentence and a big grin spread across his face wiping away all his earlier weariness pringle stared at the head of cid the grin was infectious it spread to him what is it he demanded what the hell have you been hiding up your sleeve its funny said andy martin slowly that a good coppers a good copper all the time neil mcllhenney was out for a drive yesterday with a friend he took her down to the western end of the lammermuirs to the far end of the track that takes the walkers to longformacus while he was up there he spotted a fish farm but theres no fish farm there sir mcgurk protested ive listed them all and ive visited them all there just isnt one there autographs in the rain youre right jack there isnt according to the local environmental health department or to the scottish executive department of agriculture or to the trout farmers association sammy pye checked with all of them this morning and called me while i was driving down here it doesnt exist but its there nonetheless because big neil says it is and so does the lady who was with him i have a feeling that if you look at raymond anders business records you might find some unexplained equipment purchases that can be explained right there martin leaned back in his chair the grin was far from extinguished sammy checked something else for me too bright lad sammy the land in that area is owned by a family trust theres not much you can do with it other than graze sheep shoot and fish the river that runs through it the trust was established by a rubber planter who bought the land when he came back from the far east sixty years ago he must have seen the war signs in the air and got out in the nick of time its administered by a small firm of surveyors to the landed gentry based in edinburgh there are only two trustees now the planters daughter and her son his name is gates bill gates the exclaimed dan pringle then ran out of adjectives bastards arent they just they steal their own fish take the insurance money or nearly all of it and restock at a profit having transferred the originals to another site for sale in the normal way at top market prices total take probably fifty grand each after theyd paid off anders and the third man in the team so what do we do now pringle mused lift them martin shook his head too soon too soon youd get gates but if he kept quiet the crown office wouldnt act against lander or alvarez on the basis of the evidence we have at the moment we have to catch them together i dont envy you the job dan but its got to be done we have to stake out that farm until they all show up karen sat in her car and took a deep breath and looked up the narrow path which led to the terraced house well sergeant neville she whispered to herself if you had known that this came with the territory would you have taken it on she saw a curtain move in a groundfloor window of course you would she answered herself doesnt make it easy though steeling herself she stepped out of the car the front door opened before she reached it the woman who awaited her was in the second half of her twenties only a few years younger than she was herself she was casually dressed in a hard rock teeshirt and designer jeans but she wore them well her dark hair was wavy permed karen guessed mrs martin the woman in the doorway asked unnecessarily for she had been expecting the visit im mary mcgurk come on in she showed the visitor into her small living room a toddler sat in the middle of the floor playing intently with a plastic hammer and bricks this is regan said her mother we called her after the guy in the sweeney jacks idea but it suits her look at her shes about as good at the diy as her father she glanced at her visitor again here have we met karen grinned pleased to be recognised yes at a cid dance a couple of years ago you were with jack and i was with sammy pye i was ds neville then in the head of cids office i still am in a way i married him a few months back yes i remember now you were the girl in that dress fast track to the top eh said mary mcgurk with a light laugh youre off your mark in another way too i see when are you due the early summer actually god is it that obvious already well youre quite well endowed naturally who could forget that dress come to think of it so autographs in the rain hah laughed karen tell me about it i expect that ill have boobs like mountains for a few months but that after that theyll be off to the deep south no the other woman smiled thats not necessarily how it goes good luck to you anyway therell be times when youre grateful for the company if nothing else now would you like a cup of tea its made thatd be nice thanks as she waited in an armchair regan put down her hammer crawled over and climbed up on to her lap aunty she said in a clear voice get you down off there the mother scolded as she returned ah leave her alone shes fine fine but a bit erratic still though put her down if she starts to feel warm these new nappies are good but they dont work miracles so mrs martin she said as she put a cup of tea and a twofinger kitkat on a small table beside her chair what brings you here for a start i havent come to act the grand lady its karen okay mary mcgurk nodded andy my husband said i should come but not before superintendent pringle spoke to jack and he agreed ive had a bee in my bonnet for a while mary about the police service and the way it handles its officers now although ive left the force im actually in a position to do something about it when a police officer has a problem on the job if he or she has a close call or he sees something thats really hard to take then theres very good established machinery these days to deal with the consequences the force our force at least is as interested in a persons emotional wellbeing as in his physical fitness and that stretches from the rawest police cadet to the chief constable for example andy even had counselling himself earlier on this year but keep that to yourself theres a flaw in it we listen to me talking as if im still part of it give support for onthejob developments but we tend to forget that there can be trauma down the line as well especially if the officers partner isnt part of the force when coppers marry coppers like andy and me or like maggie rose and mario mcguire theres a builtin understanding in the relationship just the same as when teachers marry teachers doctors marry doctors social workers set up home with social workers and so on autographs in the rain but when a copper marries an art teacher you mean mary interrupted no i didnt im still speaking generally here in my own case when andy goes out of that door every day for all his rank i know that there are risks because of the way he does his job you do not always get to deal with nice people ironically his predecessor rarely set foot outside his office yet he was killed in a plane crash coming back from a meeting in london i can live with these risks because ive been exposed to them myself and i can keep them in perspective but it has to be more difficult for you to watch jack go out on an investigation where someones been murdered and vwhere the person who did it is still at large now the fact is the risks are minimal but theyre always going to be there in your mind when the niggling stress they cause is compounded by something else like in your case a career move to another division then too damn right its going to affect you and because of that its inevitable that its going to affect jack karen held up a hand i promise you this jack has not been running around the borders moaning about his bloody wife or anything like that but he and dan pringle work very closely together dan likes him and he cares about him so even if jack tried he couldnt hide his worries from him what im getting round to saying here mary is that i believe that there should be a proper support group for officers partners as well as for the men and women themselves and im bloody well going to see that it is set up mary mcgurk opened her mouth to speak but in the end only a sigh came out youre right in what youre saying she murmured at last i do feel remote sometimes but can i ask you a straight question karen interposed suppose jack wasnt a detective and this move wasnt happening would you two still have a problem no not through me anyway i love him okay i want you to tell me what we can do to help but first i have to j make a point this is a disciplined service and jack was in it when you two married in this setup in the lower ranks you dont always get to apply for your job very often an officer is offered a posting with his longterm career development in mind in a force like ours with a big geographical area that can sometimes mean moving house thats whats happened with jack he wasnt posted down to the borders because detective superintendent pringle likes the way he makes coffee or thinks hes fun to have around dan took him down there because he believes that hes a damn good officer who could fill his own shoes one day divisional commander and above at the moment hes living monday to friday in a reasonably comfortable police squat down in the division thats not ideal for him and its bloody awful for you with the baby and even worse since the job can have erratic hours they dont have many major investigations down in the borders just your luck that he should pitch up there at the start of one maybe said mary but what if i move down there and its just the same with him never being home its such a big thing moving house and at least in edinburgh ive got my family my friends look we cant solve all your problems if you put enough pressure on jack he can ask for a move back up town and hell get it itll be cid too not back into uniform unless thats what he wants but it will slow down his career development and it could prevent him going as far as he might so what can we do to make this move as positive for you as possible youre an art teacher would you like to go back to work parttime or full time well get you a job would it be easier for you to move south without the big commitment of buying a house fine keep this one put a tenant in it a young copper maybe wholl look after the place or else well find you a nice place in a nice community that you can rent until its time for jacks next move which will probably be to a divisional detective inspector job do you want to get to know people down there as a first step you can join the police partners support group that im setting up ive only sent out one mailshot and ive got two hundred members already one third of them in the borders you can do all that asked mary even a job i called round the education departments before i came here this morning im a trained teacher too i know the ropes theres a job going in a secondary in galashiels that you could start after christmas full time or mornings only up to you can i talk to jack about it karen looked down at regan who was sleeping on her lap i think that would be a pretty good idea dont you q take it away jackie said dan pringle youre looking a happier boy this morning even in this freezing bloody pit f youre looking a bit smug yourself sir if i may say so you and mary got things sorted out then for the foreseeable at least said the sergeant shes going to give it a shot shes going for an interview with the council head of education on monday then once this thing cracks were going to look at places to rent in and around gala shes also going to help karen martin set up this support group of hers the way things are going shell have no bloody time for regan and me when she gets down here aye well well no be sending the dcss wife out to counsel you pringle rumbled you boys still okay in here he enquired conversationally rather than solicitously fine sir dc donovan and i have never been more comfortable have we jason no sergeant the young detective constable agreed not bothering to hide the irony in his voice but so far it hasna rained the three were seated on folding chairs in a deep camouflaged hide which had been dug out under cover of darkness on the crest of a hillock just over a quarter of a mile from the supposedly nonexistent fish farm its walls were lined with black plastic to contain the damp a small butane gas heater burned in a corner of the tenfoot square trench and a camping stove stood beside it with a kettle coming to the boil the sloping roof which used the line of the hillside was planking with heather laid over the top and it was ventilated by the slit window through which its occupants were able to keep watch on the floodlit enclosure the man still there the superintendent asked yes mcgurk replied still the same story no ones come or gone autographs in the rain since we set up here overnight on monday the blokes living in the portakabin near the entrance he comes out every so often to load the automatic feeders and check the stock then he goes back in again always he wears this big parka thing with a hood so we cant get a good look at him one thing though hes got a rifle in there we dont get all that many gulls this far inland but hes shot a couple that have come close has he now said pringle that makes this a siege in that case when we take this place down well have armed officers in the team sir donovan called out suddenly peering through the observation hatch theres something going on here theres a tanker arriving mcgurk grabbed his nonreflective field glasses and turned to look out of the viewing slot right enough boss he said although pringle was peering over his shoulder a big vehicle not unlike a petrol tanker or the sort of machine they use to pump out septic tanks one man in the cab the guys out of the portakabin and hes opening the gate as they watched the driver of the tanker eased it carefully through the gates and took up position within reach for its long flexible hose of two of the eight large tanks satisfied he left the engine running and jumped from the cab fucking hell its gates mcgurk called out in a stifled shout as the three policemen watched the mellerkirk manager and the hooded man unfastened the suction pipe from the side of the tanker and positioned it in the tank on the left then gates stepped up to a control panel mounted beside the door and pressed a button a new sound overrode that of the engine the higherpitched noise of a pump at work jack said pringle i want him followed when he leaves here ill stay here and keep an eye on whats happening you two get down the hill and into your land rover and be in position to follow when he moves off no radio just in case we keep in touch through our mobiles the sergeant nodded and led donovan out of the hide taking care to disturb the sloping roof as little as possible as they left the pumping operation continued for twenty minutes until both tanks had been emptied as gates and his companion stowed the hose once more pringle took out his mobile and called mcgurks number ready jack yes sir magic this isnt it said the superintendent its just like being a real polisman again okay hes on the move call me when you get where youre going he ended the call and watched as the tanker turned awkwardly within the compound then drove back out of the gate the hooded man closed it behind him then went back inside his portakabin pringle sat back and waited he made himself a mug of tea from the kettle on the small gas stove eventually he made another at last his mobile played its little tune yes he answered eagerly youre not going to believe this sir came jack mcgurks drawl gates has just driven up the track to mellerkirk v in his hide the superintendent laughed quietly the audacious wee so andso he said the insurance moneys come through and gates is selling sir adrian watsons own fucking fish back to him at top dollar you can bet i wish i could find it in my heart to feel sorry for the arrogant bastard but when this comes out in evidence in the high court itll be the talk of the new club job well done jack lets keep the other two under close observation then all well have to do is wait until they show up take identifiable photographs of them on site and they should be ours save for one thing boss same old problem how do we identify the fish fuck that were past that now well just charge them all with murder and theft and stand back so were not trampled in the rush to be the lucky one whos allowed to shop the others and become a crown witness are you sure its safe to leave louise on her own asked bob skinner yes replied mcllhenney emphatically theres no problem i thought id take the chance to come into the office since theyre shooting a scene in the laigh hall this afternoon you know where that is just about directly below the great hall itself its a part of the building that we can control quite easily no ones getting in without identifying themselves to a uniformed officer everyone involved on the shoot has to carry a laminated photopass signed by warren judd no less theyll become collectors items the dcc grunted sourly i doubt it theres too many of the bloody things there are a hell of a lot of people in a fullscale film production crew you know especially the sort of bigbudget jobs that lou works on listen to the expert hows the filming been going anyway mr de mille remarkably smoothly considering that they lost monday silver split the crew into two so they could film simultaneously on different locations lous not in every scene herself so it was simply a matterof dividing up the extras theyre all checked out too i hope to be sure they all have photopasses as well even lucy lous sister shes got a walkon part shes a thesp too said skinner surprised i didnt know that well the inspector sounded hesitant it isnt as simple as that shed like to be but shes got a couple of big obstacles no joke intended she looks too much like her sister for a start shed have difficulty establishing her own identity on top of that shes not a very good actress ah thats unfortunate lous got her a couple of jobs on the back of which she has an equity card but she didnt exactly shine in either of them still when she asked for a part in the new movie lou got soft and told silver to write her in what does she play lous characters sister what else shes only got a couple of lines though one in the laigh hall today and the other in the big climax scene theyre shooting that in the great hall over the weekend its not finished already is it no said mcllhenney quickly theyve got another week of location shooting after this then they break for christmas and come back to do the hogmanay stuff and during the break skinner asked i mean theres no reason to suppose were going to have caught this bloke by then have you given any thought to that no i suppose i mean has lou given any thought to it if shes still under protection he went on you have to spend christmas with your kids christ i should have thought this through before i allowed you to move her in with you whatever your personal relationship in spite of your personal relationship he shouted i have messed this up i should have moved her in with mario and maggie not you sure his assistant said quietly if youd done that at the start aye and if alex hadnt been working that friday night lou and i might never have met but she was and we did and there and then things started to happen between us without either of us being aware of it until the truth dawned dont worry im a big boy wellfired in lifes furnace you might say im not disregarding the possibility that lous feelings might change once this clowns caught and the strain is off her it was just about the first thing i asked her in fact she said no that shes sure in any event i know how i feel about her and thats got sod all to do with being her knight in shining armour its man and woman pure and simple so let me ask you this boss he stopped no let me ask you bob man to man if sarah was under this sort of threat would you delegate the job of protecting her or would you allow the chief to delegate it sitting on the edge of his desk the dcc smiled at his friend no i would not he answered truthfully as you know damn well doesnt alter my question though what are we going to do during that christmas break to get you and the kids together yet protect lou shes thought about that too we havent discussed life after john steed as you might put it but the christmas question has come up lou has four homes said neil one in london one on the cote dazur one in ireland where shes officially resident and one in beverly hills its autographs in the rain on an estate with its own security and she wants us all to go there for christmas if we did dyou think your pal in the states could fix it for me to carry a firearm i know he could skinner grinned dont shoot anyone unless you have to though it could get messy i promise boss in that case he was interrupted by the ringing of the dccs private line skinner frowned in momentary exasperation then picked it up yes he snapped its dave mackenzie mr skinner im going to need your help the strathclyde di sounded anxious sure if i can what do you want me to do can you have a word with my superintendent asked mackenzie plaintively ive spent all week logging on to porno websites in the process ive run up this bloody enormous bill on my credit card for material ive downloaded if id known what i was getting into id have cleared the spend before i started i didnt though when i went to the dci he crapped himself and referred it up the line the super went apeshit and demanded to know exactly what the fuck ive been up to i had to show her the list you gave me now shes demanding to know exactly where the fuck it came from i tried to tell her that i had a source to protect she told me that in that case i could protect him even more by paying my own credit card bill im in it deep sir can you help me skinner laughed i reckon i can he said is this your divisional commander youre talking about thats right youre in luck bandit she and i went to the same primary school in motherwell not only will i fix it i wont even need to tell her that i got involved in your investigation after you threatened to lock up my secretary mackenzie sighed with relief thanks sir he exclaimed ive been trying to imagine having to explain to my wife that ive wiped out our christmas spending power by downloading porno videos thats okay ill pull another string and have you set up with an untraceable amex account for the rest of it ah said the inspector i dont think im going to need much of it this is where i get to the good news i think ive got a result skinner in his swivel chair sat bolt upright youve what son i thought autographs in the rain id probably sent you on the dirtiest wild goose chase of all time and youre telling me youve got something yes sir the dcc could almost hear the young man beam i found it on a website on your list called www dot mortestrellas dot ec death stars skinner translated whats the dot ec bit ecuador i think the site narratives in spanish and english its desperate stuff sir a series of short videos of girls made up to look like pop stars being abused and then stabbed or strangled theres an onsite disclaimer that says that all scenes of violence are simulated mackenzies voice grew grim but theyre not sir be sure theyre not l among these i found a series of videos offered for download under the title blue star falling numbers one to six so far ive downloaded the first two theyre different sir the he paused for a second performers are an old man and a young woman both naked and in action her more than him though shes wearing a mask but he isnt the downloaded quality isnt all that great and ive only seen old john mcconnell once on a mortuary slab after hed been dead in his bath for a fortnight but good for you dave said skinner what are you going to do with it first off sir i want to show it to you at some point im going to have to show it to ruth to get an identification and id like you to look at it first charming but i started you off on this so i suppose thats only fair ill tell you what to do download the rest then link it all together if you can transfer it to vcr then do it if not store it on zip discs or whatever it takes and bring it through here we can look at it with my technicians ill have them isolate an image of the old man and enhance it as far as they can well show that to ruthie nothing else til get you a shot of the woman too mask or not it might help come through here tomorrow morning ten oclock well be ready bugger jurisdiction now bandit this investigation doesnt have any borders any more he hung up would you credit that he said the boys got a result he thinks hes found ruthies uncle starring in a south american porno movie you rate that boy dont you said mcllhenney skinner nodded more highly with every encounter he reminds me of a young bloke i knew once hes got the gift whats that luck and he pushes it he looked at his assistant lous on a secure set tomorrow yes mcllhenney nodded come and meet him once youve dropped her off i dont relish watching what i think hes going to show us so i wouldnt mind some company besides another set of eyes might see something mackenzies and mine dont david mackenzie leaned back in his chair and looked at gwendoline dell as she entered his office off the hook with the super she asked he wiped his hand across his forehead in a mock gesture thank god he said or thank bob at least good for you now are you going to tell me what landed you in it in the first place and what youve been doing all week while ive been running myself ragged trying to find john mcconnells grandfather clock not to mention his girlfriend no the inspector replied seriously i wont expose you to it until i have to and even then ill think twice about it sexist pig she exclaimed dont you go treating me differently to a male officer dont worry im not i wouldnt let anyone see this stuff unless it was absolutely necessary he swung his chair round to face the computer which sat on a table beside his desk now bugger off gwennie and dont come in unless i call you the sergeant turned and left with a frown and a disdainful sniff mackenzie pressed the startup button of the pc he was waiting for it to boot up when his phone rang he picked it up i thought i said no calls he told the switchboard operator this is one you said you would take sir the man replied miss mair the inspectors eyebrows rose he smiled tut her through miss mair he said heartily as the call was put through margaret what can i do for you dont be familiar with me young man you can do nothing for me i assure you i on the other hand what time do you have to be on set tomorrow neil asked too casually why she smiled do you want rid of me already not for one second but the boss has got someone coming to see him and hes asked me if i can sit in on the meeting in that case my dear you can drop me off any time you like louise paused as if she was considering something touching her lips in one of the trademark gestures which were familiar to millions of movie fans around the world she caught him looking at her and clenched her fist quickly i cant stop doing that she said not even on camera catherine the great one la hooker a lady brain surgeon several stressedout housewives and now a scots criminal lawyer have all had that same mannerism til bet it suited them all too it looked pretty daft on catherine the great i have to say in this case though it was masking a brilliant idea do you think that the kids would like to come on set tomorrow were shooting the big surprise ending but if we put them on scouts honour or guides honour or whatever it is these days im sure theyll keep the secret till the movie comes out hey could they do that ive got this complicated arrangement for spence with the boss bringing him up town and mario thats my pal mario mcguire you havent met him yet hes head of special branch and his wifes a detective super picking him up from fettes and taking him to his minirugby at murrayfield but im sure that lauren and mark would love it wait a minute while i make a phone call he went into the hall returning a few minutes later sorted sarah will take them to parliament house for ten oclock then shell leave the two younger ones with alex and go shopping you are one popular lady right now ill tell you never mind the kids the greatest gift you can give a mother with five youngsters on her hands is an afternoon of freedom in jenners and john lewis as he looked at her he saw a peculiar expression cross her face what he asked oh nothing you just walked over my grave thats all she tapped her chest once upon a time she said one of my most secret dreams was to be able to take pleasure myself from a gift like that to leave the kids with someone indulge myself then go home in the knowledge that they and their dad would be waiting for me long gone that dream he took her in his arms and held her close rubbing his face in her hair there was much that he could have said to her but not at that moment eventually she looked up at him what about christmas she asked quietly yes come what may suppose we catch this man tomorrow the kids and i will come with you to los angeles ill book the flights tomorrow no she said firmly til book them hey he protested that isnt part of the deal yes it is its my christmas present to you its more than that in fact its a very inadequate thank you for all youve done for me for all youre doing for all youre giving me so please me by saying not another word about the subject she stopped his reply with a kiss theres only one other thing i wish i could do for christmas she murmured whats that give my dad his mind back but all the money in the world wont do that hes all alone now there in his head in every respect in fact he has no friends any more most of them drifted away years ago there was one old guy from his working days but even he seems to have stopped coming around now she sat on the sofa pulling him down beside her my lifes going to change in a lot of ways love one of them will be the amount of time i give to my father being back here for this movie seeing him the other day as he was made me realise how selfish ive been and not only towards him t thought i could discharge my obligations with money by paying for nursing care and such like but in reality ive just abandoned him dumped him on my kid sister made him her problem while ive gone on pinning gold stars on my cv you know whats going to happen to me at new year theyre going to make me a bloody cbe when they offered it to me months ago now i accepted because i thought autographs in the rain it would be nice for my father nice for him they could be turning me into a giant carrot and he wouldnt notice the difference lucy was delighted for me of course but that didnt make me feel any better things are going to be different dads always resisted the idea of going into a nursing home but hes a kind man and if he could still think straight he would accept that its inevitable so im going to make it happen hell be looked after in the best place i can find and ill be there to see him every week and where will this place be neil asked close love she whispered as close by as i can find theres nothing positive yet sir said jack mcgurk im on observation here at the moors site and coordinating mr pringle is watching landers place and donovan my dc on this job is parked at the alvarez womans house half an hour ago she left coldstream heading north then ten minutes ago lander left his house superintendent pringle said i should call you to keep you advised good for dan andy martin retorted but what about gates whos watching him gates is ours sir any time we want him he owns the secret site and he used the fish there to restock sir adrian watsons farm even if we cant do him for theft and murder there will be about twenty other things that the crown office can throw at him not good enough at the very least im going to charge every person at the scene with that girls murder we know where lander and alvarez were but gates is unaccounted for im betting that he was there i want him jack i want to see him go down with a life sentence i hear you sir ill keep you in touch as things develop no tell me once you have a resolution meantime ill call your divisional headquarters like dan asked me to and have an armed response team put at your disposal if you do have to go in there there will be no chances taken with that rifle are any of you three carrying i am sir donovans not qualified and mr pringle wont not any more in that case should you have to go in there you will lead you know the procedure clear warning given then fire in response to a perceived threat take no risks with officers lives you know that there is an armed man on that site i am ordering you to make the assumption that everyone there is carrying im timing that order at eight twentyseven saturday morning december the sixteenth ill back your judgement all the way au luukafna n inc rii very good sir mcgurk understood what he was being told as he signed off the call a cold chill of fear ran through him he went back to the observation slit of the dugout on the moor and watched the site for ten minutes more before the muted tone of his mobile rang out again jackie dan pringle yes sir weve trailed them both to sir adrian watsons estate not to the fish farm but up an access road to somewhere else were out of sight in a layby near the road end we cant go any further all we can do is wait here and hope like hell that there isnt another way out can you take them down there sir the sergeant asked hopefully theyre bound to be meeting up with gates not good enough son they could say theyre all getting ready for a ramblers association hike we have to get them together on that site or identify them there individually only then can we haud on a minute the superintendent broke off jack he resumed breathlessly after a few seconds two tankers have just come out of that access road alvarez is driving one and lander the other its a pound to a pinch theyre heading in your direction well follow them but well out of sight im not going to blow this by having them spot us is your armed team set up theyll be on their way by now sir right call divisional hq and have them given precise instructions to proceed to your hide flatout but jackie its touch and go wholl be there first whatever else happens once those two trucks go into that compound they do not come out understood sir this time the chill of fear turned into a shiver which it took mcgurk some time to control he had never felt so alone his heart was pounding as he peered through the slit watching the site waiting listening for the sound of a police vehicle at the foot of the hill behind him until after god knew how long two long white tanker vehicles appeared up the rough track the first one blowing its horn as it approached rousing the caretaker from his cabin bringing him out to open the gate he watched as the two vehicles drove into the compound taking up position between the rows of tanks among the six which were still full and still he was alone where are you dan he whispered but it brought him no nearer oh shit he slipped backwards out of the hide and began to run crouched moving crabwise round the side of the hill trying to stay invisible to lander alvarez and their warden he could hear the tankers pumping as he moved and hoped that they had no superfast setting at last he came to a small clump near the gate and hid behind it gathering his breath and his nerve this is it jack he said drawing his pistol the walther with which he had always felt most comfortable on the firing range the gun which he had never before drawn far less used for real switching off the safety he launched himself from his hiding place and ran to the gate vrmed police officer he shouted at the top of his voice but too late to stop the sitewatcher who had seen him as soon as he broke cover from reaching his portakabin and diving inside the others still had their backs to him watching their tankers as they sucked up the fish lander alvarez he shouted again armed police stop what youre doing and turn around with your hands raised although she was further away she heard him first she turned as she was told and he seeing her followed suit his hands were still at his side as he walked towards the detective with the woman behind him as if she was trying to use him as a shield i only see one of you sergeant he called out dont you harry as he spoke the minder stepped out of his shelter rifle in his hands and harrys got a bigger gun than you mcgurk levelled the walther drop it or ill he shouted but as he did the man snapped his weapon to his shoulder and sighted it at him he dropped to a crouch and pulled the trigger not one but three shots rang out even after the postmortem and the official enquiry jack mcgurk never knew because he was never told and never asked whether the man had died by his bullet or that fired by the marksman from the armed response team standing on the crest of the hill but he did know how close he had come himself for the rest of his life a tiny crescentshaped nick out of his left ear would always be there to remind him the three of them mcgurk lander mercy alvarez stood or crouched frozen by the echoes of the gunfire until a shout shattered the silence you two on the ground now face down hands on head the two fish farmer lovers did as they were told instantly lying there as dan pringle and dc donovan marched past the sergeant to frisk them autographs in the rain roughly and cuff their hands behind their back with plastic ties finally they were hauled to their feet as the armed team swarmed into the compound mcgurk walked over to the dead man who was he he wondered dan pringle came to stand beside him i can tell you that he used to work at mellerkirk until he got laid off after the first robbery no wonder gates had another job for him his name was harry conroy said glenn lander he was ray anders father rays mother did a runner when he was a kid and he and his sister were adopted by a family in yorkshire ray traced his old man eventually and came back up here to set up his business the estate owner looked at pringle til tell you everything he said it was all gates idea ray tried to sell him a system and when watson wouldnt buy he told him that his place could be knocked over easy just like ours hed tried to sell to mercy and me before that gates thought this was a great idea so he approached us he told us that if we kept clear of our farms on certain nights and asked no questions wed both make a buck we didnt know he was going to balls it up and that harry would kill the girl jack mcgurk hit him a huge righthanded punch on the side of the head far harder than any he had ever thrown on the rugby field no you bastard he snarled at the unconscious figure on the ground fingering his bleeding ear but youd have let harry there make my mary a widow pringle patted him on the shoulder and turned to mercy alvarez ive got a vacancy for a crown witness he said gates planned the whole thing anders is going down because he was there when the girl was killed harrys dead and that other one on the ground there hes having the fucking book thrown at him whether or not the accs married to his cousin you tell us the whole story he just started and youll be charged with defrauding your insurance company youll plead guilty and youll get a couple of years max if you get a really good lawyer the judge might even suspend it what do you say she looked up at the burly policeman a gleam in her dark eyes as her lover began to stir on the ground at her feet where do i sign she asked autographs in the rain whats the big surprise ending by the way neil asked as he and louise stoqd at the entrance to parliament house which had been allocated to the film crew im not telling you that she said with a smile youd find out if you were here to see it but as it is only the kids get to know as he spoke sarahs freelander was waved by a security guard into the area between st giles cathedral and parliament house she drove towards them past the parked cars and the equestrian statue as soon as she stopped the nearside doors opened and lauren and mark jumped out sarah leaned over in the driving seat and she looked at the couple there was still something behind neils eyes something that would always be there but for the first time since his wifes death the big policeman looked content as if a kind of peace had come into his life as of course it had against all hope and to his complete surprise you two are looking pleased with yourselves she said are we louise replied i dont know why he is hes going to work he squeezed her shoulder what are you talking about so are you she laughed you know even after all these years i forget that sometimes when its a scene i really fancy its like going out to play have a good game then said sarah and thanks for helping free up my saturday neil leaned over and closed the passenger door as she drove off louise took each of the children by the hand and turned towards the hall she raised herself slightly on her toes and kissed him have a nice day she whispered as laurens eyes widened he saw them into the building into the safekeeping of the uniformed police at the entrance then walked the short distance to his car the fettes headquarters were on saturday mode and so he found a parking space at the front of the building beside a red ford ka which i seemed to look slightly selfconscious beside bob skinners bmw the dcc said to tell you hes in the technical unit mr mcllhenney the door officer advised him neil nodded and set off along the twisty route to tony davidsons kingdom he rapped on the technical directors door pened it and stepped inside davidson himself was absent but at his meeting table sat bob skinner and another man mcllhenney sized him up early thirties leather jacket type a bit flash maybe confident but clearly in awe of the boss neil said skinner this is the bandit di dave mackenzie david neil mcllhenney my exec as they shook hands neil completed his appraisal with a look in the eye yes he liked the bloke even if he had given ruthie a hard time tonys off working his magic on the downloads that dave brought with him the dcc explained theyre videos and we think they may show ruthies uncle quickly he filled mcllhenney in on the background to mackenzies internet trawl he had barely finished before tony davidson returned to summon them to his neonlit viewing room ive cleaned up mr mackenzies files as best i could he said and edited them together into a single video for ease of viewing ive done a fast transfer to a betacam tape linked to a twenty eightinch monitor he handed skinner a black device bob theres the remote ive seen whats on there and frankly i dont want to see it again he turned and left the room switching off the lights as he went skinner felt himself tense as he pressed the play button on the device the monitor screen flashed grey for a second then black then the title appeared estrella azul caida he read blue star fallen it vanished and a caption appeared also in spanish he translated it for the others dark star at play the dark side of a famous lady it is for you what the hell does that mean he murmured as figures appeared their movements slightly jerky from the download but clear enough an old man silver haired a woman wearing a white carnival mask much younger longlimbed dark hair well cut above shoulderlength both naked her flesh firm his sagging but still showing solid musculature left side on to the camera as she teased him coaxed him stirred him first into life then into prodigious size jesus mcllhenney murmured looking away in disgust as she straddled him when he looked back he could tell by the lighting and the position of the camera that the scene had changed something else too the old man seemed diminished weaker slighter in his build if not in his genitalia as the woman bent over him her right side to the camera jesus this time it was skinner who blasphemed but his was an exclamation of horror he froze the image on the scene david he snapped leave us alone for a minute the strathclyde detective looked at him puzzled but obeyed without question as the door closed behind him the dcc stared at his assistant look he said his hand pointing towards the screen that birthmark on the womans right hip in the shape of a blue star louise has one exactly like it a few years back she did a movie with a nude scene it showed that birthmark i remembered it straight away mcllhenney looked at the image then back at his friend he read shock in his face saw that he was shaking no boss he said quietly lou used to have a birthmark like that one but not any more she had another nude scene in her last movie but one a long one she didnt fancy the idea of showing it again and so she had it removed surgically and new skin grafted on where it had been as it happened the director shot the scene mostly in darkness so it didnt show the graft wasnt perfect theres still a faint mark there i asked her about it and she told me all about it that isnt lou but its some sick cow who wants us to think that it is someone who knew about the birthmark but doesnt know that it aint there anymore the sound of relief which burst from bob skinner was more of an explosion than a sigh bandit he shouted towards the door you can come back in now as the young inspector reentered the room he pressed the play button once more they watched the home movie to the end to the last awful scene the woman still naked still marked injecting the poor sad old man needle into a vein in his erection making him jump with pain holding him until the drugs took him to the edge of a stupor then the bath hot steam obscuring the lens but not enough to hide his feeble struggle first as he felt the scalding heat then as she held him beneath the surface her hands and forearms protected by long rubber gloves and then it was over the three policemen sat breathless staring at the autographs in the rain screen silent until mackenzie spoke do you think it was mcconnell he asked im sure it was skinner answered ruth showed me a photo once and the woman sir the way you reacted back there do you know her we were meant to think that it was louise bankier the film actress said mcllhenney quietly it wasnt though bankier the younger inspector exclaimed one of john mcconnells old workmates was a bloke called malcolm bankier i was tipped off by a contact in scotrail he lives out in bearsden i went to see him last night but hes fucking gaga there was no point even trying to question him poor old bugger doesnt know whether its breakfast time or easter mcllhenneys eyes narrowed who else was there when you saw him he asked there was a nurse and his daughter lucy her name was here was that louise bankiers old man skinner ignored the question and picked up the telephone on the table get me detective sergeant steele he ordered the switchboard operator wherever he is im in mr davidsons viewing room he replaced the phone and sat waiting he and mcllhenney staring at each other eyes locked together oblivious of the third man in the room skinner answered the return call halfway through the first ring stevie dcc here i want to ask you something from the balmoral video you saw from the description the woman in newcastle gave you could john steed be a woman think hard man before you answer he waited you sure another pause thanks the phone slammed down stevie says yes he says it could have been and so could the person in that car in london skinners gaze flashed back to mackenzie bandit the woman the neighbour saw long hair yes sir a wig long like ruthies hair photos around the house ill bet and in the box more than a camera and a stand a wig cut like lous hair and a mask its lucy neil she made that movie she killed the old man shes ruths stalker mcllhenney stared back at him struck dumb for that moment where is she now skinner asked at the great hall in parliament house where lous shooting her big scene and with mackenzies visit last night shell know were before the door of the viewing room had swung closed behind him neil mcllhenney was at the end of the corridor the bluesuited guard looked up startled as the big figure burst through the narrow swing doors yes sir he began but mcllhenney ignored him and walked straight up to the uniformed constable guarding the entrance to the great hall anything happening he asked all quiet sir he opened the brassbound door and stepped inside the finest public room in scotland was perfectly quiet yet it was full of people together they formed a tableau each in position beneath the mighty hammerbeam roof lit bluish by the great movie lights some splashed with colour from the enormous illuminated stained glass window which dominated the south end of the hall there was not a sound until elliott silver broke the perfect silence all right people he cried out in his high airy voice we all know whats happening here so lets he broke off no no no he screamed that lights all wrong theres too much on louise makes her look as if shes got a halo and she isnt even fucking dead yet neil heard a quiet tut to his right and looked sideways to see his daughter standing beside mark both of them in the care of the tiny makeup lady as the lighting cameraman made adjustments to the setup he edged over towards them still looking around then a figure moved beside the great statue of lord stair it was lucy their eyes met and from that moment there was no more doubt only understanding no more questions only truths in her gaze he read success triumph exultation he looked for pity but saw a hatred that seemed as old as time he looked for madness but saw only vicious satisfaction as if she knew she had won and he did not know why he did not know how he looked back across the hall to centre stage for the first time he saw lou her back to him wearing an advocates wig and a dark trouser suit facing her he saw ralph annand a hard expression set on his face his left arm was loosely around the throat of a third actor a young girl and there was something something the policeman could not see in his right hand as it hung by his side he felt a tug at his sleeve and looked down mark mcgrath bob skinners adopted son looked up at him with his wise young eyes is that a real gun uncle neil he whispered he looked again until he saw what mark could see from his viewpoint through the ruck of bodies ralph annand was holding a sawnoff shotgun he gasped and then as if from nowhere warren judd was standing before him what happens in this scene mcllhenney demanded the producer looked at him as if he was insane he took a fistful of his jacket and lifted him on to the points of his toes tell me he hissed judds eyes started out of his head as the policemans grip tore out a forest of chest hairs lous client thats annand is guilty after all someone smuggles him in a shotgun he takes a hostage she tries to block his way and he shoots her as neils mind raced silvers voice slashed through his shots okay everybody take one and action he dropped judd and looked over the heads of the crouching production crew as annand tightened his grip on his mock hostage and raised what was indeed a very real gun he could see that the actor was locked in concentration and in any case he was afraid to shout instead he ran straight forward bulldozing his way through everything in his path over the ten yards between him and the gun flattening silver as the outraged director tried to block him reaching annands awareness and his body at the same time grabbing his right arm and swinging it upward as his finger tightened on the trigger even under such a high roof the explosion sounded huge as the actor fired both barrels of the sawnoff upwards harmlessly away from lou annands face twisted as he swung at mcllhenney with his free arm the policeman headbutted him between the eyes then dropped him like a stone under a shower of coloured glass fragments from the stained glass window which had just disintegrated above their heads he grabbed lou and held her to him protecting her from the particles all around him he was aware of people diving for cover autographs in the rain was it him she whispered ralph no love not him im sorry it was lucy somehow she switched blanks for real cartridges its been lucy all along no she twisted in his arms dont say that its true honey im so sorry but its true do you know a man called john mcconnell he felt her nod an old friend of my dads she murmured strange man he used to visit lucy called him uncle john well lucy killed old uncle john and filmed herself doing it she tried to make herself look like you she tried to make people think that you had done it she began to sob he felt tears soak his shirt she was out to ruin your career to ruin your life if she could elliott silvers womanlike scream from the back of the great hall seemed to tear them apart neil relaxed his hold on louise and followed its direction the makeup woman lay on the ground stunned above her stood lucy holding lauren his daughter just as ralph annand had held his screen hostage but with a cuticle knife pressed to her throat okay daddy she shouted hoarsely bring your car keys over here your little girl and i are going for a ride he looked at lauren signalling to her with his eyes that she should keep calm that he would make it all right he walked towards her reaching down as if for the car keys but in reality for the glock which was tucked into the waistband of his denims finding time to wonder how it could ever be the same between lou and him once he had blown her sisters brains all over parliament house he was aware of bob skinner and of mackenzie watching from the doorway bob knew what he was going to do all right and stood there motionless as if signalling him to get it over with you know why lucy shouted as he walked towards her theres my life and theres hers her with her fucking oscars and me with only simple bloody darren to give me relief from the pain of watching our father shit in his nappy every bloody day in life you know that dont you sure he said evenly but those days are over kid all over he was almost on top of her his hand on the butt of the pistol ready for a pointblank shot when a small voice rang out from behind her drop it and put your hands up lucys eyes widened as she turned her head and her grip on the knife slackened it was enough he let go of his gun snatched the weapon with his flashing left hand then punched her with his right once on the temple pulling the blow slightly but still knocking her senseless he grabbed her round the waist as she fell and as he did he saw mark frightened but brave still holding ralph annands abandoned shotgun which he had retrieved from the floor in the panic creeping round behind lucy as she focused her gaze on neil to ram both barrels into the middle of her back lauren looked up at him with her mothers eyes sometimes dad she said im even more proud of you than i am normally now what she asked is this with you and louise he gazed at her in astonishment then exploded into laughter grabbing his daughter and embarrassing her by throwing her into the air then hugging her to him as lou arrived to hug them both when the hubbub the confusion the panic was over when the unit doctor had sedated lucy before her transfer to hospital under police guard when he had treated elliott silver for hysteria and straightened ralph annands nose when bob skinner long since had taken the children off to join jazz and seonaid he took lou away out of the hall up the stairway and into the deserted signet library im so sorry neil she exploded into tears once again as he sat her down beneath the great tiers of books which held much of the story of scotlands law what should you be sorry for he asked her gently stroking her hair for what my sisters done for what i made do for what she did to your daughter shh love laurens seen worse than that in her short life for one thing shes seen her mother die you have nothing to reproach yourself for and dont ever let me hear you do it again she looked up at him tearstained i love you dyou know that he hugged her i was hoping whats going to happen to her neil what if i dont press charges those are the least of them honey he said sadly but truthfully even if you dont lucy still has to answer to ruth for the awful things she did to john mcconnell she still has to answer to glenys for clarence sparrow but shes crazy she must be theres crazy and theres crazy the law has its own definition he paused looking for and finding a handkerchief to dry her tears autographs in the rain listen he murmured thoughtfully maybe i shouldnt tell you this but the boss would do the same if he was here theres a guy called kevin omalley hes a psychiatrist call him tonight and put him on a retainer it will be better for lucy if hes on her team hes the best and if he says that she is unfit to plead or was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time the crimes were committed the crown is not likely to argue with him if he wasnt working for you hed probably be on their team telling them the same thing but best to be sure whatever happens lucys going away love its a matter of where and for how long thats all he heard a diplomatic cough from the doorway and swivelled round to see bob skinner returned standing behind them i heard that advice inspector he said you were dead right so right in fact that ive already phoned omalley tell me something lou he asked have you got any of your own money in this production not likely she retorted im scottish remember anyway if theyve got me they dont need my money why dyou ask because the productions going to be on hold for a long time itll take them about three years to mend that broken window next door bob skinner was late for work on the following monday morning it was one of those rare days on which he felt slightly fragile after the short notice dinner party which he and sarah had thrown the night before for neil and louise and andy and karen martin he had just settled in behind his desk when his internal telephone rang come in and see me for a minute the chief constable asked unusual he thought as he crossed the hall why the summons proud jimmy looked at him quizzically as he entered his office coffee he invited no thanks ive got one across the hall ah fine have you managed to mollify your pal the lord president of the court of session just about bob replied i spoke to him on saturday night hes a bit upset about the mess in his great hall but hes pleased that everyone walked away from it afterwards the guy whos really pissed off though is warren judd the producer hes having a hell of a time persuading his insurance company to cough up for the reinstatement of the window they seem to think that he should have been able to prevent anyone bringing live rounds on to his set hes asked me to put in a word for him and will you not for him the little shit i will for the window though its a national treasure and it must be restored what news of the girl omalley needs more time with her but provisionally reckons that the crown will accept that she had diminished responsibility at the time of the offences theyll take pleas on two charges of culpable homicide and shell go to hospital for however long it takes which as you and i both know could be for ever thatll not be the case with dan pringles job though three of them autographs in the rain are going down for life for that girls murder and one for the attempted murder of mcgurk as well even though he didnt fire the shot how is the sergeant hes got a sore ear but a change of underpants and the rest of the month off with his wife and kid should see him all right skinner frowned what did you want me for anyway he asked or was that it no said proud jimmy i thought youd like to see this he handed him a sheet of paper the scottish executive information directorate are releasing it at midday take it away with you and read it over your coffee skinner nodded and left the chiefs room walking back to his own settled behind his desk he picked up his mug and read the note when he had finished he began to laugh and laugh and laugh he laughed so loudly that eventually his door opened as neil mcllhenney and ruth mcconnell came unbidden to investigate read that he said choking as he passed the paper to the inspector mcllhenney frowned then did as he was told press release he began em chief inspector of constabulary announced today that assistant chief constable theodore chase of edinburgh has been appointed an assistant inspector in his office with immediate effect announcing the appointment hmcic sir ross montgomerie said although he has been in scotland for only a short time mr chase has impressed me greatly with his dedication to his duties and with his appreciation of the traditional values of police work he is a fine addition to my team is this for real skinner nodded still almost speechless what an operator he said at last who asked mcllhenney chase no you daft bugger the chief how i would love to know what the hell hes got on montgomerie to have managed to pull this one off he shook his head what an operator oh neil he called out his composure restored as his two assistants left ask inspector good to look in on me will you please i the great bell rang midnight amplified by loudspeakers all along princes street happy new millennium saidneil last year was only a rehearsal you appreciate he kissed her long and sweet then kissed his daughter and shook hands formally with his son above their heads fireworks exploded and cascaded from the castle rock thanks for christmas in los angeles he murmured in her ear no said lou thanks for this its much better ah he muttered this is all sweetness and light now but wait for a few hours last year they had three armed events in leith alone in the first twelve hours of the year god you coppers have a cynical view of mankind how am i going to fit into your life i wonder i dont know he said seriously how are you like a glove at the very least im taking a long sabbatical from the film business youve got me for keeps if you want she pressed her hands to his chest dont worry she told him i wont try to supplant olive in here i know i cant no so just be yourself youve got your own place in here he nodded at the children as they gazed up at the pyrotechnics in the sky and in theirs too you dont need to be their mother being you will be enough he grinned big and infectious hey remember what you said a few weeks back about me walking over your grave premonitions dont have to be ominous you know maybe what i was really doing was kickstarting your future she leaned against him in that case neil im only fortytwo and these days lots of women my age how would you feel about that he looked down at her smiling and drew her to him we can but try he answered in her ear as the rockets soared and the crowds roared my love we can but try
