correspondence of carlyle and emerson lxxvi emerson to carlyle concord july my dear carlyle i have lately received from our slow friends james munroe co on account of their sales of the miscellanies and i enclose a bill of exchange for l which cost it is a long time since i sent you any sketch of the account itself and indeed a long time since it was posted as the booksellers say but i will find a time and a clerk also for this i have had no word from you for a long space you wrote me a letter from scotland after the death of your wifes mother and full of pity for me also and since i have heard nothing i confide that all has gone well and prosperously with you that the iron puritan is emerging from the past in shape and stature as he lived and you are recruited by sympathy and content with your picture and that the sure repairs of time and love and active duty have brought peace to the orphan daughters heart my friend alcott must also have visited you before this and you have seen whether any relation could subsist betwixt men so differently excellent his wife here has heard of his arrival on your coast no more i submitted to what seemed a necessity of petty literary patriotism i know not what else to call it and took charge of our thankless little dial here without subscribers enough to pay even a publisher much less any laborer it has no penny for editor or contributor nothing but abuse in the newspapers or at best silence but it serves as a sort of portfolio to carry about a few poems or sentences which would otherwise be transcribed and circulated and always we are waiting when somebody shall come and make it good but i took it as i said and it took me and a great deal of good time to a small purpose i am ashamed to compute how many hours and days these chores consume for me i had it fully in my heart to write at large leisure in noble mornings opened by prayer or by readings of plato or whomsoever else is dearest to the morning muse a chapter on poetry for which all readings all studies are but preparation but now it is july and my chapter is rudest beginnings yet when i go out of doors in the summer night and see how high the stars are i am persuaded that there is time enough here or somewhere for all that i must do and the good world manifests very little impatience stearns wheeler the cambridge tutor a good grecian and the editor you will remember of your american editions is going to london in august probably and on to heidelberg c he means i believe to spend two years in germany and will come to see you on his way a man whose too facile and goodnatured manners do some injustice to his virtues to his great industry and real knowledge he has been corresponding with your tennyson and editing his poems here my mother my wife my two little girls are well the youngest edith is the comfort of my days peace and love be with you with you both and all that is yours r w emerson in our present ignorance of mr alcotts address i advised his wife to write to your care as he was also charged to keep you informed of his place you may therefore receive letters for him with this lxxvii carlyle to emerson chelsea london july my dear emerson lest opportunity again escape me i will take her this time by the forelock and write while the matter is still hot you have been too long without hearing of me far longer at least than i meant here is a second letter from you besides various intermediate notes by the hands of friends since that templand letter of mine the letter arrived yesterday my answer shall get under way today first under the head of business let it be authenticated that the letter enclosed a draft for l a new unexpected munificence out of america which is ever and anon dropping gifts upon me to be received as indeed they partly are like manna dropped out of the sky the gift of unseen divinities the last money i got from you changed itself in the usual soft manner from dollars into sovereigns and was what they call all right all except the little bill of eight pounds and odds i think drawn on frasers executors by brown little and brown which bill the said executors having refused for i know not what reason i returned it to brown with note of the dishonor done it and so the sum still stands on his books in our favor frasers people are not now my booksellers except in the matter of your essays and a second edition of sartor the other books i got transferred to a certain pair of people named chapman and hall strand which operation though i understand it was transacted with great and vehement reluctance on the part of the fraser people yet produced no quarrel between them and me and they still forward parcels c and are full of civility when i see them so that whether this had any effect or none in their treatment of brown and his bill i never knew nor indeed having as you explained it no concern with browns and their affairs did i ever happen to inquire i avoid all booksellers see them rarely the blockheads study never to think of them at all booksales reputation profit c c all this at present is really of the nature of an encumbrance to me which i study not without success to sweep almost altogether out of my head one good is still possible to me in life one only to screw a little more work out of myself my miserable despicable yet living acting and so far imperial and celestial self and this god knows is difficulty enough without any foreign one you ask after cromwell ask not of him he is like to drive me mad there he lies shining clear enough to me nay glowing or painfully burning but far down sunk under two hundred years of cant oblivion unbelief and triviality of every kind through all which and to the top of all which what mortal industry or energy will avail to raise him a thousand times i have rued that my poor activity ever took that direction the likelihood still is that i may abandon the task undone i have bored through the dreariest mountains of rubbish i have visited naseby field and how many other unintelligible fields and places i have c c alas what a talent have i for getting into the impossible meanwhile my studies still proceed i even take a ghoulish kind of pleasure in raking through these old bonehouses and burialaisles now i have the strangest fellowship with that huge genius of death universal president there and catch sometimes through some chink or other glimpses into blessed ulterior regions blessed but as yet altogether silent there is no use of writing of things past unless they can be made in fact things present not yesterday at all but simply today and what it holds of fulfilment and of promises is ours the dead ought to bury their dead ought they not in short i am very unfortunate and deserve your prayers in a quiet kind of way if you lose tidings of me altogether and never hear of me more consider simply that i have gone to my natal element that the mud nymphs have sucked me in as they have done several in their time sterling was here about the time your letters to him came your american reprint of his pieces was naturally gratifying him much he seems getting yearly more restless necessitated to find an outlet for himself unable as yet to do it well i think he will now write review articles for a while which craft is really perhaps the one he is fittest for hitherto i love sterling a radiant creature but very restless incapable either of rest or of effectual motion aurora borealis and sheet lightning which if it could but concentrate itself as i say always we had much talk but on the whole even his talk is not much better for me than silence at present me miserum the poetical works of john sterling philadelphia directly about the time of sterlings departure came alcott some two weeks after i had heard of his arrival on these shores he has been twice here at considerable length the second time all night he is a genial innocent simplehearted man of much natural intelligence and goodness with an air of rusticity veracity and dignity withal which in many ways appeals to one the good alcott with his long lean face and figure with his gray worn temples and mild radiant eyes all bent on saving the world by a return to acorns and the golden age he comes before one like a kind of venerable don quixote whom nobody can even laugh at without loving my poor wife is still weak overshadowed with sorrow her loss is great the loss almost as of the widows mite for except her good mother she had almost no kindred left and as for friends they are not rife in this world god be thanked withal they are not entirely nonextant have i not a friend and friends though they too are in sorrow good be with you all t carlyle by far the valuablest thing that alcott brought me was the newspaper report of emersons last lectures in new york really a right wholesome thing radiant fresh as the morning a thing worth reading which accordingly i clipped from the newspaper and have in a state of assiduous circulation to the comfort of many i cannot bid you quit the dial though it too alas is antinomian somewhat perge perge nevertheless and so now an end t c lxxviii carlyle to emerson chelsea london august my dear emerson this morning your new letter of the th august has arrived exactly one fortnight old thanks to the gods and steamdemons i already perhaps six weeks ago answered your former letter acknowledging the mannagift of the l and other things nor do i think the letter can have been lost for i remember putting it into the postoffice myself today i am on the eve of an expedition into suffolk and full of petty business however i will throw you one word were it only to lighten my own heart a little you are a kind friend to me and a precious and when i mourn over the impotence of human speech and how each of us speak or write as he will has to stand dumb cased up in his own unutterabilities before his unutterable brother i feel always as if emerson were the man i could soonest try to speak with were i within reach of him well we must be content a pen is a pen and worth something though it expresses about as much of a mans meaning perhaps as the stamping of a hoof will express of a horses meaning a very poor expression indeed this letter of th august is missing your bibliopolic advice about cromwell or my next book shall be carefully attended if i live ever to write another book but i have again got down into primeval night and live alone and mute with the manes as you say uncertain whether i shall ever more see day i am partly ashamed of myself but cannot help it one of my grand difficulties i suspect to be that i cannot write two books at once cannot be in the seventeenth century and in the nineteenth at one and the same moment a feat which excels even that of the irishmans bird nobody but a bird can be in two places at once for my heart is sick and sore in behalf of my own poor generation nay i feel withal as if the one hope of help for it consisted in the possibility of new cromwells and new puritans thus do the two centuries stand related to me the seventeenth worthless except precisely in so far as it can be made the nineteenth and yet let anybody try that enterprise heaven help me i believe at least that i ought to hold my tongue more especially at present thanks for asking me to write you a word in the dial had such a purpose struck me long ago there have been many things passing through my head marchmarching as they ever do in long drawn scandalous falstaffregiments a man ashamed to be seen passing through coventry with such a set some one of which snatched out of the ragged rank and dressed and drilled a little might perhaps fitly have been saved from chaos and sent to the dial in future we shall be on the outlook i love your dial and yet it is with a kind of shudder you seem to me in danger of dividing yourselves from the fact of this present universe in which alone ugly as it is can i find any anchorage and soaring away after ideas beliefs revelations and such like into perilous altitudes as i think beyond the curve of perpetual frost for one thing i know not how to utter what impression you give me take the above as some stamping of the forehoof surely i could wish you returned into your own poor nineteenth century its follies and maladies its blind or halfblind but gigantic toilings its laughter and its tears and trying to evolve in some measure the hidden godlike that lies in it that seems to me the kind of feat for literary men alas it is so easy to screw ones self up into high and ever higher altitudes of transcendentalism and see nothing under one but the everlasting snows of himmalayah the earth shrinking to a planet and the indigo firmament sowing itself with daylight stars easy for you for me but whither does it lead i dread always to inanity and mere injuring of the lungs stamp stamp stamp well i do believe for one thing a man has no right to say to his own generation turning quite away from it be damned it is the whole past and the whole future this same cottonspinning dollarhunting canting and shrieking very wretched generation of ours come back into it i tell you and so for the present will stamp no more adieu my friend i must not add a word more my wife is out on a visit it is to bring her back that i am now setting forth for suffolk i hope to see ely too and st ives and huntingdon and various cromwelliana my blessings on the concord household now and always commend me expressly to your wife and your mother farewell dear friend t carlyle lxxix emerson to carlyle concord october my dear carlyle i am in your debt for at least two letters since i sent you any word i should be well content to receive one of these stringent epistles of bark and steel and mellow wine with every days post but as there is no hope that more will be sent without my writing to signify that these have come i hereby certify that i love you well and prize all your messages i read with special interest what you say of these english studies and i doubt not the book is in steady progress again we shall see what change the changed position of the author will make in the book the first history expected its public the second is written to an expecting people the tone of the first was proud to defiance we will see if applauses have mitigated the masters temper this time he has a hero and we shall have a sort of standard to try by the hero who fights the hero who writes well may grand and friendly spirits assist the work in all hours may impulses and presences from that profound world which makes and embraces the whole of humanity keep your feet on the mount of vision which commands the centuries and the book shall be an indispensable benefit to men which is the surest fame let me know all that can be told of your progress in it you shall see in the last dial a certain shadow or mask of yours another richmond who has read your lectures and profited thereby alcott sent me the paper from london but i do not know the name of the writer as for alcott you have discharged your conscience of him manfully and knightly i absolve you well he is a great man and was made for what is greatest but i now fear that he has already touched what best he can and through his more than a prophets egotism and the absence of all useful reconciling talents will bring nothing to pass and be but a voice in the wilderness as you do not seem to have seen in him his pure and noble intellect i fear that it lies under some new and denser clouds an article on cromwell in the dial for october for the dial and its sins i have no defence to set up we write as we can and we know very little about it if the direction of these speculations is to be deplored it is yet a fact for literary history that all the bright boys and girls in new england quite ignorant of each other take the world so and come and make confession to fathers and mothers the boys that they do not wish to go into trade the girls that they do not like morning calls and evening parties they are all religious but hate the churches they reject all the ways of living of other men but have none to offer in their stead perhaps one of these days a great yankee shall come who will easily do the unknown deed the booksellers have sent me accounts lately but i know not why no money little and brown from january to july had sold very few books i inquired of them concerning the bill of exchange on frasers estate which you mention and they said it had not been returned to them but only some information as i think demanded by frasers administrator which they had sent and as they heard nothing again they suppose that it is allowed and paid to you inform me on this matter munroe co allow some credits but charge more debits for binding c and also allege few sales in the hard times i have got a good friend of yours a banking man to promise that he will sift all the account and see if the booksellers have kept their promises but i have never yet got all the papers in readiness for him i am looking to see if i have matter for new lectures having left behind me last spring some halfpromises in new york if you can remember it tell me who writes about loyola and xavier in the edinburgh sterlings papers if he is near you are all in mr russells hands i played my part of fadladeen with great rigor and sent my results to russell but have not now written to j s yours rwe mr al russell who had been instrumental in procuring the american edition of sterlings poetical works lxxx carlyle to emerson chelsea london november my dear emerson your letter finds me here today busied with many things but not likely to be soon more at leisure wherefore i may as well give myself the pleasure of answering it on the spot the fraser bill by brown and little has come all right the dumfries banker apprises me lately that he has got the cash into his hands pray do not pester yourself with these bookseller unintelligibilities i suppose their accounts are all reasonably correct the cheating such as it is done according to rule what signifies it at any rate i am no longer in any vital want of money alas the want that presses far heavier on me is a want of faculty a want of sense and the feeling of that renders one comparatively very indifferent to money i reflect many times that the wealth of the indies the fame of ten shakespeares or ten mahomets would at bottom do me no good at all let us leave these poor slaves of the ingot and slaves of the lamp to their own courses within a certain extent of halter what you say of alcott seems to me altogether just he is a man who has got into the highest intellectual region if that be the highest though in that too there are many stages wherein a man can believe and discern for himself without need of help from any other and even in opposition to all others but i consider him entirely unlikely to accomplish anything considerable except some kind of crabbed semiperverse though still manful existence of his own which indeed is no despicable thing his more than prophetic egoism alas yes it is of such material that thebaid eremites sectfounders and all manner of crossgrained fanatical monstrosities have fashioned themselves in very high and in the highest regions for that matter sectfounders withal are a class i do not like no truly great man from jesus christ downwards as i often say ever founded a sect i mean wilfully intended founding one what a view must a man have of this universe who thinks he can swallow it all who is not doubly and trebly happy that he can keep it from swallowing him on the whole i sometimes hope we have now done with fanatics and agonistic posturemakers in this poor world it will be an immense improvement on the past and the new ideas as alcott calls them will prosper greatly the better on that account the old gloomy gothic cathedrals were good but the great blue dome that hangs over all is better than any cologne one on the whole do not tell the good alcott a word of all this but let him love me as he can and live on vegetables in peace as i living partly on vegetables will continue to love him the best thing alcott did while he staid among us was to circulate some copies of your man the reformer i did not get a copy i applied for one so soon as i knew the right fountain but alcott i think was already gone and now mark for this i think is a novelty if you do not already know it certain radicals have reprinted your essay in lancashire and it is freely circulating there and here as a cheap pamphlet with excellent acceptance so far as i discern various newspaper reviews of it have come athwart me all favorable but all too shallow for sending to you i myself consider it a truly excellent utterance one of the best words you have ever spoken speak many more such and whosoever will distort them into any vegetable or other crotchet let it be at his own peril for the word itself is true and will have to make itself a fact therefore though not a distracted abortive fact i hope words of that kind are not born into facts in the seventh month well if they see the light fullgrown they and their adjuncts in the second century for old time is a most deliberate breeder but to speak without figure i have been very much delighted with the clearness simplicity quiet energy and veracity of this discourse and also with the fact of its spontaneous appearance here among us the prime mover of the printing i find is one thomas ballantyne editor of a manchester newspaper a very good cheery little fellow once a paisley weaver as he informs me a great admirer of all worthy things a lecture read before the mechanics apprentices library association boston january my paper is so fast failing let me tell you of the writer on loyola he is a james stephen head undersecretary of the colonial office that is to say i believe real governor of the british colonies so far as they have any governing he is of wilberforces creed of wilberforces kin a man past middle age yet still in full vigor reckoned an enormous fellow for despatch of business c especially by taylor van artevelde and others who are with him or under him in downing street i regard the man as standing on the confines of genius and dilettantism a man of many really good qualities and excellent at the despatch of business there we will leave him a mrs lee of brookline near you has made a pleasant book about jean paul chiefly by excerpting i am sorry to find gunderode co a decided weariness cromwell cromwell do not mention such a word if you love me and yet farewell my friend tonight yours ever t carlyle i will apprise sterling before long he is at falmouth and well urging me much to start a periodical here gambardella promises to become a real painter there is a glow of real fire in the wild southern man next to no articulate intellect or the like but of inarticulate much or i mistake he has tried to paint me for you but cannot he says life of jean paul frederic richter compiled from various sources together with his autobiography translated from the german in two volumes boston this book which is one of the best in english concerning jean paul was the work of the late mrs thomas eliza buckminster lee in the dial for january is an article by miss fuller on bettine brentano and gunderode a decided weariness the canoness gunderode was a friend of bettines older and not much wiser than herself lxxxi carlyle to emerson chelsea london march dear emerson i know not whose turn it is to write though a suspicion has long attended me that it was yours and above all an indisputable wish that you would do it but this present is a cursory line all on business and as usual all on business of my own i have finished a book and just set the printer to it one solid volume rather bigger than one of the french revolution volumes as i compute it is a somewhat fiery and questionable tract for the times not by a puseyite which the terrible aspect of things here has forced from me i know not whether as preliminary to oliver or not but it had gradually grown to be the preliminary of anything possible for me so there it is written and i am a very sick but withal a comparatively very free man the title of the thing is to be past and present it is divided into four books book i proem book ii the ancient monk book iii the modern worker and book iv horoscope or some such thing the size of it i guessed at above the practical business accordingly is how to cut out that new york scoundrel who fancies that because there is no gallows it is permitted to steal i have a distinct desire to do that altogether apart from the money to be gained thereby a friends goodness ought not to be frustrated by a scoundrel destitute of gallows you told me long since how to do the operation and here according to the best way i had of fitting your scheme into my materials is my way of attempting it the book will not be out here for six good weeks from this date it could be kept back for a week or two longer if that were indispensable but i hope it may not in three weeks half of it will be printed i in the meanwhile get a correct manuscript copy of the latter half made ready joining the printed sheets and this manuscript your bookseller will have a three weeks start of any rival if i instantly despatch the parcel to him will this do this with the announcement of the title as given above pray write to me straightway and say your answer will be here before we can publish and the packet of proofsheets and manuscript may go off whether there be word from you or none and so enough of past and present and indeed enough of all things for my haste is excessive in these hours the last dial came to me about three weeks ago as a postletter charged something like a guinea of postage if i remember so it had to be rejected and i have not yet seen that number but will when my leeway is once brought up a little again the two preceding numbers were to a marked extent more like life than anything i had seen before of the dial there was not indeed anything except the emersonian papers alone which i know by the first ring of them on the tympanum of the mind that i properly speaking liked but there was much that i did not dislike and did half like and i say i fausto pede that will decidedly do better by the bye it were as well if you kept rather a strict outlook on alcott and his english tail i mean so far as we here have any business with it bottomless imbeciles ought not to be seen in company with ralph waldo emerson who has already men listening to him on this side of the water the tail has an individual or two of that genus and the rest is mainly yet undecided for example i knew old myself and can testify if you will believe me that few greater blockheads if blockhead may mean exasperated imbecile and the ninth part of a thinker broke the worlds bread in his day have a care of such i say always to myself and to you which you forgive me adieu my dear emerson may a good genius guide you for you are alone alone and have a steep pilgrimage to make leading high if you do not slip or stumble ever your affectionate t carlyle lxxxii carlyle to emerson chelsea april my dear carlyle along with this letter there will go from liverpool on the th instant the promised parcel complete copy of the book called past and present of which you already had two simultaneous announcements the name of the steam packet i understand is the britannia i have addressed the parcel to the care of messrs little and brown booksellers boston with your name atop i calculate it will arrive safe enough the letter making the second announcement being very similar to the preceding is omitted about one hundred pages of the manuscript copy have proved superfluous the text being there also in a printed shape i had misestimated the printers velocity i was anxious too that there should be no failure as to time the manuscript is very indifferent in that section of it the damage therefore is smaller your presscorrector can acquaint himself with the hand c by means of it a poor young governess confined to a horizontal posture and many sad thoughts by a disease of the spine was our artist in that part of the business her writing is none of the distinctest but it was a work of charity to give it her i hope the thing is all as correct as i could make it i do not bethink me of anything farther i have to add in the way of explanation in fact my prophecy rather is at present that the gibbetless thief at new york will beat us after all never mind if be do to say truth i myself shall almost be glad there has been a botheration in this anxious arrangement of parts correcting of scrawly manuscript copies of what you never wished to read more and insane terror withal of having your own manuscript burnt or lost that has exceeded my computation not to speak of this trouble in which i involve you my friend which i truly declare makes me ashamed true one is bound to resist the devil in all shapes if a man come to steal from you you will put on what locks and padlocks are at hand and not on the whole say steal then but if the locks prove insufficient and the thief do break through that side of the alternative also will suit you very well and with perhaps a faint prayer for gibbets when they are necessary you will say to him next time macte virtute my man all is in a whirl with me here today no other topic but this very poor one can be entered upon i hope for a letter from your own hand soon and some news about still more interesting matters adieu my friend i feel still as if in several senses you stood alone with me under the sky at present the signature to this letter has been cut off lxxxiii emerson to carlyle concord april my dear carlyle it is a pleasure to set your name once more at the head of a sheet it signifies how much gladness how much wealth of being that the good wise mancheering manhelping friend though unseen lives there yonder just out of sight your star burns there just below our eastern horizon and fills the lower and upper air with splendid and splendescent auroras by some refraction which new lenses or else steamships shall operate shall i not yet one day see again the disk of benign phosphorus it is a solid joy to me that whilst you work for all you work for me and with me even if i have little to write and seldom write your name since i last wrote to you i found it needful if only for the households sake to set some new lectures in order and go to new congregations of men i live so much alone shrinking almost cowardly from the contact of worldly and public men that i need more than others to quit home sometimes and roll with the river of travelers and live in hotels i went to baltimore where i had an invitation and read two lectures on new england on my return i stopped at philadelphia and my course being now grown to four lectures read them there at new york my snowball was larger and i read five lectures on new england religion trade genius manners and customs recent literary and spiritual influences from abroad domestic spiritual history perhaps i have not quite done with them yet but may make them the block of a new and somewhat larger structure for boston next winter the newspaper reports of them in new york were such offensive misstatements that i could not send you as i wished a sketch between my two speeches at baltimore i went to washington thirtyseven miles and spent four days the two poles of an enormous political battery galvanic coil on coil selfincreased by series on series of plates from mexico to canada and from the sea westward to the rocky mountains here meet and play and make the air electric and violent yet one feels how little more than how much man is represented there i think in the higher societies of the universe it will turn out that the angels are molecules as the devils were always titans since the dulness of the world needs such mountainous demonstration and the virtue is so modest and concentrating but i must not delay to acknowledge the arrival of your book it came ten or eleven days ago in the britannia with the three letters of different dates announcing it i have read the superfluous hundred pages of manuscript and find it only too popular beside its abundance of brilliant points and proverbs there is a deep steady tide taking in either by hope or by fear all the great classes of society and the philosophic minority also by the powerful lights which are shed on the phenomenon it is true contemporary history which other books are not and you have fairly set solid london city aloft afloat in bright mirage in the air i quarrel only with the popular assumption which is perhaps a condition of the humor itself that the state of society is a new state and was not the same thing in the days of rabelais and of aristophanes as of carlyle orators always allow something to masses out of love to their own art whilst austere philosophy will only know the particles this were of no importance if the historian did not so come to mix himself in some manner with his erring and grieving nations and so saddens the picture for health is always private and original and its essence is in its unmixableness but this book with all its affluence of wit of insight and of daring hints is born for a longevity which i will not now compute in one respect as i hinted above it is only too good so sure of success i mean that you are no longer secure of any respect to your property in our freebooting america you must know that the cheap press has within a few months made a total change in our book markets every english book of any name or credit is instantly converted into a newspaper or coarse pamphlet and hawked by a hundred boys in the streets of all of our cities for or cents dickenss notes for cents blackwoods magazine for cents and so on three or four great new york and philadelphia printinghouses do this work with hot competition one prints bulwers novel yesterday for cents and already in twentyfour hours another has a coarser edition of it for cents in all thoroughfares what to do with my sealed parcel of manuscripts and proofs no bookseller would in these perilous circumstances offer a dollar for my precious parcel i inquired of the lawyers whether i could not by a copyright protect my edition from piracy until an english copy arrived and so secure a sale of a few weeks they said no yet advised the taking a certificate of copyright that we might try the case if we wished after much consulting and balancing for a few hours i decided to print as heretofore on our own account an edition but cheap to make the temptation less to retail at seventyfive cents i print fifteen hundred copies and announce to the public that it is your edition and all good men must buy this i have written to the great reprinters namely to park benjamin and to the harpers of new york to request their forbearance and have engaged little and brown to publish because i think they have something more of weight with booksellers and are a little less likely to be invaded than munroe if we sell a thousand copies at seventyfive cents it will only yield you about two hundred dollars if we should be invaded we can then afford to sell the other five hundred copies at twentyfive cents without loss in thus doing i involve you in some risk but it was the best course that occurred hitherto the miscellanies have not been reprinted in the cheap forms and in the last year james munroe co have sold few copies all books but the cheapest being unsold in the hard times something has however accrued to your credit there jm co fear that if the new book is pirated at new york and the pirate prospers instantly the miscellanies will be plundered we will hope better or at least exult in that which remains to wit a worth unplunderable yet infinitely communicable i have hardly space left to say what i would concerning the dial i heartily hoped i had done with it when lately our poor good publishing miss peabody wrote me that its subscription would not pay its expenses we all writing for love but certain friends are very unwilling it should die and i a little unwilling though very unwilling to be the life of it as editor and now that you are safely through your book and before the greater sequel rushes to its conclusion send me i pray you that short chapter which hovers yet in the limbo of contingency in solid letters and points let it be if that is readiest a criticism on the dial and this too elysian race not blood and yet not ichor let jane carlyle be on my part and watchful of his hours urge the poet in the golden one i think to send you a duplicate of the last number of the dial by mr mann who with his bride sister of the abovementioned miss peabody is going to london and so to prussia he is little known to me but greatly valued as a philanthropist in this state i must go to work a little more methodically this summer and let something grow to a tree in my wide straggling shrubbery with your letters came a letter from sterling who was too noble to allude to his books and manuscript sent hither and which russell all this time has delayed to print i know not why but discouraged i suppose in these times by booksellers i must know precisely and write presently to js farewell rw emerson the late horace mann the following passages from emersons diary relating to past and present seem to have been written a few days after the preceding letter how many things this book of carlyle gives us to think it is a brave grappling with the problem of the times no luxurious holding aloof as is the custom of men of letters who are usually bachelors and not husbands in the state but literature here has thrown off his gown and descended into the open lists the gods are come among us in the likeness of men an honest iliad of english woes who is he that can trust himself in the fray only such as cannot be familiarized but nearest seen and touched is not seen and touched but remains inviolate inaccessible because a higher interest the politics of a higher sphere bring him here and environ him as the ambassador carries his country with him love protects him from profanation what a book this in its relation to english privileged estates how shall queen victoria read this how the primate and bishops of england how the lords how the colleges how the rich and how the poor here is a book as full of treason as an egg is full of meat and every lord and lordship and high form and ceremony of english conservatism tossed like a football into the air and kept in the air with merciless rebounds and kicks and yet not a word in the book is punishable by statute the wit has eluded all official zeal and yet these dire jokes these cunning thrusts this flaming sword of cherubim waved high in air illuminates the whole horizon and shows to the eyes of the universe every wound it inflicts worst of all for the party attacked it bereaves them beforehand of all sympathy by anticipating the plea of poetic and humane conservation and impressing the reader with the conviction that carlyle himself has the truest love for everything old and excellent and a genuine respect for the basis of truth in those whom he exposes gulliver among the lilliputians carlyle must write thus or nohow like a drunken man who can run but cannot walk what a mans book is that no prudences no compromises but a thorough independence a masterly criticism on the times fault perhaps the excess of importance given to the circumstance of today the poet is here for this to dwarf and destroy all merely temporary circumstance and to glorify the perpetual circumstance of men eg dwarf british debt and raise nature and social life but everything must be done well once even bulletins and almanacs must have one excellent and immortal bulletin and almanac so let carlyles be the immortal newspaper lxxxiv carlyle to emerson august dear emerson the bearer of this is mr macready our celebrated actor now on a journey to america who wishes to know you in the pauses of a feverish occupation which he strives honestly to make a noble one this artist become once more a man would like well to meet here and there a true american man he loves heroes as few do and can recognize them you will find whether they have on the cothurnus or not i recommend him to you bid you forward him as you have opportunity in this department of his pilgrimage mr macreadys deserts to the english drama are notable here to all the world but his dignified generous and everyway honorable deportment in private life is known fully i believe only to a few friends i have often said looking at him as a manager of great london theatres this man presiding over the unstablest most chaotic province of english things is the one public man among us who has dared to take his stand on what he understood to be the truth and expect victory from that he puts to shame our bishops and archbishops it is literally so with continued kind wishes yours as of old t carlyle lxxxv emerson to carlyle concord october my dear friend i seize the occasion of having this morsel of paper for twentyfive pounds sterling from the booksellers to send you and which fail not to find enclosed as clerks say to inquire whether you still exist in chelsea london and what is the reason that my generous correspondent has become dumb for weary months i must go far back to resume my thread i think in april last i received your manuscript c of the book which i forthwith proceeded to print after some perplexing debate with the booksellers as i fully informed you in my letter of april or beginning of may since that time i have had no line or word from you i must think that my letter did not reach you or that you have written what has never come to me i assure myself that no harm has befallen you not only because you do not live in a corner and what chances in your dwelling will come at least to my ears but because i have read with great pleasure the story of dr francia which gave the best report of your health and vivacity carlyles article on dr francia in the foreign quarterly review no reprinted in his miscellanies i wrote you in april or may an account of the new state of things which the cheap press has wrought in our book market and specially what difficulties it put in the way of our edition of past and present for a few weeks i believed that the letters i had written to the principal new york and philadelphia booksellers and the preface had succeeded in repelling the pirates but in the fourth or fifth week appeared a mean edition in new york published by one collyer an unknown person and supposed to be a mask of some other bookseller sold for twelve and one half cents and of this wretched copy several thousands were sold whilst our seventyfive cents edition went off slower there was no remedy and we must be content that there was no expense from our edition which before september had paid all its cost and since that time has been earning a little i believe i am not fairly entitled to an account of the book from the publishers until the st of january i have never yet done what i have thought this other last week seriously to do namely to charge the good and faithful ep clark a man of accounts as he is a cashier in a bank with the total auditing and analyzing of these accounts of yours my hesitation has grown from the imperfect materials which i have to offer him to make up so long a story but he is a good man and do you know it a carlylese of that intensity that i have often heard he has collected a sort of album of several volumes containing illustrations of every kind historical critical c to the sartor i must go to boston and challenge him once when i asked him he seemed willing to assume it no more of accounts tonight i send you by this ship a volume of translations from dante by doctor parsons of boston a practising dentist and the son of a dentist it is his gift to you lately went henry james to you with a letter from me he is a fine companion from his intelligence valor and worth and is and has been a very beneficent person as i learn he carried a volume of poems from my friend and nearest neighbor w ellery channing whereof give me i pray you the best opinion you can i am determined he shall be a poet and you must find him such i have too many things to tell you to begin at the end of this sheet which after all this waiting i have been compelled to scribble in a corner with company waiting for me send me instant word of yourself if you love me and of those whom you love and so god keep you and yours r waldo emerson in the second number of the dial in october emerson had published under the title of new poetry an article warmly commending mr channings then unpublished poems lxxxvi carlyle to emerson chelsea london october my dear emerson it is a long weary time since i have had the satisfaction of the smallest dialogue with you the blame is all my own the reasons would be difficult to give alas they are properly noreasons children not of something but of mere idleness confusion inaction inarticulation of nothing in short let us leave them there and profit by the hour which yet is i ran away from london into bristol and south wales when the heats grew violent at the end of june south wales north wales lancashire scotland i roved about everywhere seeking some jacobspillow on which to lay my head and dream of things heavenly yes that at bottom was my modest prayer though i disguised it from myself and the result was i could find no pillow at all but sank into ever meaner restlessness blacker and blacker biliary gloom and returned in the beginning of september thoroughly eclipsed and worn out probably the weariest of all men living under the sky sure enough i have a fatal talent of converting all nature into preternaturalism for myself a truly horrible phantasmreality it is to me what of heavenly radiances it has blended in close neighborhood in intimate union with the hideousness of death and chaos a very ghastly business indeed on the whole it is better to hold ones peace about it i flung myself down on sofas here for my little wife had trimmed up our little dwellingplace into quite glorious order in my absence and i had only to lie down there in reading books and other makebelieve employments i could at least keep silence which was an infinite relief nay gradually as indeed i anticipated the black vortexes and deluges have subsided and now that it is past i begin to feel myself better for my travels after all for one thing articulate speech having returned to me you see what use i make of it on the table of the london library voted in by some unknown benefactor whom i found afterwards to be richard milnes there lay one thing highly gratifying to me the last two numbers of the dial it is to be one of our periodicals henceforth the current number lies on the table till the next arrive then the former goes to the binder we have already in a bound volume all of it that emerson has had the editing of this is right nay in edinburgh and indeed wherever ingenuous inquisitive minds were met with i have to report that the said emerson could number a select and most loving public select and i should say fast growing for good and indifferent reasons it may behove the man to assure himself of this farther to the horror of poor nickerson bookseller frasers successor a certain scoundrel interloper here has reprinted emersons essays on grayish paper to be sold at two shillings distracting nickerson with the fear of change i was glad at this if also angry it indicates several things nickerson has taken his measures will reduce the price of his remaining copies indeed he informs me the best part of his edition was already sold and he has even some color of money due from england to emerson through me with pride enough will i transmit this mournful noble peculium and after that as i perceive such chivalrous international doings must cease between us past and present some one told me was in spite of all your precautions straightway sent forth in modest gray and your benevolent speculation ruined here too you see it is the same such chivalries therefore are now impossible for myself i say well let them cease thank god they once were the memory of that can never cease with us in this last number of the dial which by the bye your bookseller never forwarded to me i found one little essay a criticism on myself which if it should do me mischief may the gods forgive you for it is considerably the most dangerous thing i have read for some years a decided likeness of myself recognizable in it as in the celestial mirror of a friends heart but so enlarged exaggerated all transfigured the most delicious the most dangerous thing well i suppose i must try to assimilate it also to turn it also to good if i be able eulogies dyslogies in which one finds no features of ones own natural face are easily dealt with easily left unread as stuff for lighting fires such is the insipidity the wearisome nonentity of pabulum like that but here is another sort of matter the beautifulest piece of criticism i have read for many a day says every one that speaks of it may the gods forgive you i have purchased a copy for three shillings and sent it to my mother one of the indubitablest benefits i could think of in regard to it a criticism by emerson of past and present in the dial for july it embodies a great part of the extract from emersons diary given in a preceding note and is well worth reading in full for its appreciation of carlyles powers and defects there have been two friends of yours here in these very days dr russell just returning from paris mr parker just bound thither we have seen them rather oftener than common sterling being in town withal they are the best figures of strangers we have had for a long time possessions both of them to fall in with in this pilgrimage of life russell carries friendliness in his eyes a most courteous modest intelligent man an english intelligence too as i read the best of it lying unspoken not as a logic but as an instinct parker is a most hardy compact clever little fellow full of decisive utterance with humor and good humor whom i like much they shine like suns these two amid multitudes of watery comets and tenebrific constellations too sorrowful without such admixture on occasion dr le baron russell theodore parker as for myself dear emerson you must ask me no questions till alas till i know not when after four weary years of the most unreadable reading the painfulest poking and delving i have come at last to the conclusion that i must write a book on cromwell that there is no rest for me till i do it this point fixed another is not less fixed hitherto that a book on cromwell is impossible literally so you would weep for me if you saw how between these two adamantine certainties i am whirled and tumbled god only knows what will become of me in the business patience patience by the bye do you know a massachusetts historical society and a james bowdoin seemingly of boston in vol ii third series of their collections lately i met with a disappointment almost ludicrous bowdoin in a kind of dancing embarrassed style gives longwinded painfully minute account of certain precious volumes containing notes of the long parliament which now stand in the new york library poises them in his assaying balance speculates prophesies inquires concerning them to me it was like news of the lost decades of livy good heavens it soon became manifest that these precious volumes are nothing whatever but a wretched broken old dead manuscript copy of part of our printed commons journals printed since and known to all barbers if the historical society desired it any member of parliament could procure them the whole stock lords and commons a wheelbarrowful or more with no cost but the carriage every member has the right to demand a copy and few do it few will let such a mass cross their doorthreshold this of bowdoins is a platitude of some magnitude adieu dear emerson rest not haste not you have work to do t carlyle lxxxvii carlyle to emerson chelsea london november dear emerson about this time probably you will be reading a letter i hurried off for you by dr russell in the last steamer and your friendly anxieties will partly be set at rest had i kept silence so very long i knew it was a long while but my vague remorse had kept no date it behoves me now to write again without delay to certify with all distinctness that i have safely received your letter of the th october safely the bill for l it contained that you are a brave friendly man of most serene beneficient way of life and that i god help me by all means appoint this mr clark to the honorary office of accountkeeper if he will accept it by parkers list of questions from him and by earlier reminiscences recalled on that occasion i can discern that he is a man of lynx eyesight of an allinvestigating curiosity if he will accept this sublime appointment it will be the clearest case of elective affinity accounts to you must be horrible as they are to me indeed i seldom read beyond the last line of them if i can find the last and one of the insupportabilities of bookseller accounts is that nobody but a wizard or regular adept in such matters can tell where the last line and final net result of the whole accursed babblement is to be found by all means solicit clark at all events do you give it up i pray you and let the booksellers do their own wise way it really is not material let the poor fellows have length of halter every new bill from america comes to me like a kind of heavenly miracle a reaping where i never sowed and did not expect to reap the quantity of it is a thing i can never bring in question for your english account with nickerson i can yet say nothing more perhaps about newyearsday the poor man will enable me to say something i hear however that the pirate has sold off or nearly so his twoshillings edition of the essays and is preparing to print another this directly in the teeth of cash and doubleentry bookkeeping i take to be good news james is a very good fellow better and better as we see him more something shy and skittish in the man but a brave heart intrinsically with sound earnest sense with plenty of insight and even humor he confirms an observation of mine which indeed i find is hundreds of years old that a stammering man is never a worthless one physiology can tell you why it is an excess of delicacy excess of sensibility to the presence of his fellowcreature that makes him stammer hammond lestrange says who ever heard of a stammering man that was a fool really there is something in that james is now off to the isle of wight will see sterling at ventnor there see whether such an isle or france will suit better for a winter residence we channings poems are also a kind gift from you i have read the pieces you had cut up for me worthy indeed of reading that poem on death is the utterance of a valiant noble heart which in rhyme or prose i shall expect more news of by and by but at bottom poetry is a most suspicious affair for me at present you cannot fancy the oceans of twaddle that human creatures emit upon me in these times as if when the lines had a jingle in them a nothing could be something and the point were gained it is becoming a horror to me as all speech without meaning more and more is i said to richard milnes now in honesty what is the use of putting your accusative before the verb and otherwise entangling the syntax if there really is an image of any object thought or thing within you for gods sake let me have it the shortest way and i will so cheerfully excuse the omission of the jingle at the end cannot i do without that milnes answered ah my dear fellow it is because we have no thought or almost none a little thought goes a great way when you put it into rhyme let a man try to the very uttermost to speak what he means before singing is had recourse to singing in our curt english speech contrived expressly and almost exclusively for despatch of business is terribly difficult alfred tennyson alone of our time has proved it to be possible in some measure if channing will persist in melting such obdurate speech into music he shall have my true wishes my augury that it will take an enormous heat from him another channing whom i once saw here sends me a progressofthespecies periodical from new york ach gott these people and their affairs seem all melting rapidly enough into thawslush or one knows not what considerable madness is visible in them stare super antiquas vias no they say we cannot stand or walk or do any good whatever there by gods blessing we will fly will not you here goes and their flight it is as the flight of the unwinged of oxen endeavoring to fly with the wings of an ox by such flying universally practised the ancient ways are really like to become very deep before long in short i am terribly sick of all that and wish it would stay at home at fruitland or where there is good pasture for it friend emerson alone of all voices out of america has spheremusic in him for me alone of them all hitherto and is a prophecy and sure dayspring in the east immeasurably cheering to me god long prosper him keep him duly apart from that bottomless hubbub which is not at all cheering and so ends my litany for this day the reverend william henry channing the cromwell business though i punch daily at it with all manner of levers remains immovable as ailsa crag heaven alone knows what i shall do with it i see and say to myself it is heroical troy town was probably not a more heroic business and this belongs to thee to thy own people must it be dead forever perhaps yes and kill me too into the bargain really i think it very shocking that we run to greece to italy to c c and leave all at home lying buried as a nonentity were i absolute sovereign and chief pontiff here there should be a study of the old english ages first of all i will pit odin against any jupiter of them find seakings that would have given jason a roland for his oliver we are as you sometimes say a bookridden people a phantomridden people all this small household is well salutes you and yours with love old and new accept this hasty messenger accept my friendliest farewell dear emerson yours ever t carlyle lxxxviii emerson to carlyle concord december my dear friend i have had two good letters from you and it is fully my turn to write so you shall have a token on this latest day of the year i rejoice in this good will you bear to so many friends of mine if they will go to you you must thank yourself best when you are mutually contented i wished lately i might serve mr macready who sent me your letter i called on him and introduced him to sam g ward my friend and the best man in the city and besides all his personal merits a master of all the offices of hospitality ward was to keep himself informed of macreadys times and bring me to him when there was opportunity but he stayed but a few days in boston and ward said was in very good hands and promised to see us when he returns by and by i saw him in hamlet but should much prefer to see him as macready i must try to entice mr macready out here into my pines and alder bushes just now the moon is shining on snowdrifts four five and six feet high but before his return they will melt and already this my not native but ancestral village which i came to live in nearly ten years ago because it was the quietest of farming towns and off the road is found to lie on the directest line of road from boston to montreal a railroad is abuilding through our secretest woodlands and tomorrow morning our people go to boston in two hours instead of three and next june in one this petty revolution in our country matters was very odious to me when it began but it is hard to resist the joy of all ones neighbors and i must be contented to be carted like a chattel in the cars and be glad to see the forest fall this rushing on your journey is plainly a capital invention for our spacious america but it is more dignified and manlike to walk barefoot but do you not see that we are getting to be neighbors a day from london to liverpool twelve or eleven to boston and an hour to concord and you have owed me a visit these ten years i mean to send with your january dial a copy of the number for sterling as it contains a review of his tragedy and poems by margaret fuller i have not yet seen the article and the lady affirms that it is very bad as she was ill all the time she was writing but i hope and believe better she margaret fuller is an admirable person whose writing gives feeble account of her but i was to say that i shall send this dial for js to your care as i know not the way to the isle of wight enclosed in this letter i send a bill of exchange for l s d payable by baring co it happens to represent an exact balance on munroes books and that slow mortal should have paid it before i have not yet got to clark i who am a slow mortal but have my eye fixed on him remember me and mine with kindest salutations to your wife and brother ever yours rw emerson lxxxix carlyle to emerson chelsea january dear emerson some ten days ago came your letter with a new draft of l and odd money in it all safe the draft now gone into the city to ripen into gold and silver the letter to be acknowledged by some hasty response now and here america i say to myself looking at these money drafts is a strange place the highest comes out of it and the lowest sydney smith is singing dolefully about doleful american repudiation disowning of the soft impeachment and here on the other hand is an american man in virtue of whom america has become definable withal as a place from which fall heavenly mannashowers upon certain men at certain seasons of history when perhaps mannashowers were not the unneedfulest things we will take the good and the evil here as elsewhere and heartily bless heaven but now for the draft at the top of this leaf one colman a kind of agricultural missionary much in vogue here at present has given it me it is emersons the net produce hitherto all but two cents of emersons essays i enclose farther the booksellers hieroglyph papers unintelligible as all such are but sent over to you for scrutiny by the expert i gather only that there are some five hundred and odd of the dearpriced edition sold some two hundred and odd still to sell which the bookseller says are in spite of pirates slowly selling and that the half profit upon the whole adventure up to this date has been l s d sterling equal as i am taught at per pound sterling to for which all but the cents here is a draft on boston payable at sight pray have yourself straightway paid that if there be any mistake or delay i may rectify it while time yet is i add for the intelligence of the booksellerpapers that fraser with whom the bargain originally stood was succeeded by nickerson these are the names of the parties and so dear friend accept this munificent sum of money and expect a blessing with it if good wishes from the heart of man can give one so much for that the reverend henry colman did you receive a dumfries newspaper with a criticism in it the author is one gilfillan a young dissenting minister in dundee a person of great talent ingenuousness enthusiasm and other virtues whose position as a preacher of bare old calvinism under penalty of death sometimes makes me tremble for him he has written in that same newspaper about all the notablest men of his time godwin cornlaw elliott and i know not all whom if he publish the book i will take care to send it you i saw the man for the first time last autumn at dumfries as i said his being a calvinist dissenting minister economically fixed and spiritually with such germinations in him forces me to be very reserved to him the sketches were published the next year in a volume under the title of the gallery of literary portraits john sterlings dial shall be forwarded to ventnor in the isle of wight whenever it arrives he was here as probably i told you about two months ago the old unresting brilliantly radiating man he is now much richer in money than he was and poorer by the loss of a good mother and good wife i understand he is building himself a brave house and also busy writing a poem he flings too much sheetlightning and unrest into me when we meet in these low moods of mine and yet one always longs for him back again no doing with him or without him the dog my thrice unfortunate book on cromwell it is a real descent to hades to golgotha and chaos i feel oftenest as if it were possibler to die ones self than to bring it into life besides my health is in general altogether despicable my spirits equal to those of the ninth part of a dyspeptic tailor one needs to be able to go on in all kinds of spirits in climate sunny or sunless or it will never do the planet earth says voss take four hexameters from voss journeys this earth her eye on a sun through the heavenly spaces joyous in radiance or joyless by fits and swallowed in tempests falters not alters not equal advancing home at the due hour so thou weatherproof constant may equal with day march i have not a moment more tonight and besides am inclined to write unprofitables if i persist adieu my friend all blessings be with you always yours ever truly t carlyle xc emerson to carlyle concord february my dear carlyle i received by the last steamer your letter and its prefixed order for one hundred and twentyone dollars which order i sent to ward who turned it at once into money thanks dear friend for your care and activity which have brought me this pleasing and most unlooked for result and i beg you if you know any family representative of mr fraser to express my sense of obligation to that departed man i feel a kindness not without some wonder for those goodnatured five hundred englishmen who could buy and read my miscellany i shall not fail to send them a new collection which i hope they will like better my faith in the writers as an organic class increases daily and in the possibility to a faithful man of arriving at statements for which he shall not feel responsible but which shall be parallel with nature yet without any effort i fancy i make progress also in the doctrine of indifferency and am certain and content that the truth can very well spare me and have itself spoken by another without leaving it or me the worse enough if we have learned that music exists that it is proper to us and that we cannot go forth of it our pipes however shrill and squeaking certify this our faith in tune and the eternal amelioration may one day reach our ears and instruments it is a poor second thought this literary activity perhaps i am not made obnoxious to much suffering but i have had happy hours enough in gazing from afar at the splendors of the intellectual law to overpay me for any pains i know existence may go on to be better and if it have such insights it never can be bad you sometimes charge me with i know not what sky blue skyvoid idealism as far as it is a partiality i fear i may be more deeply infected than you think me i have very joyful dreams which i cannot bring to paper much less to any approach to practice and i blame myself not at all for my reveries but that they have not yet got possession of my house and barn but i shall not lose my love for books i only worship eternal buddh in the retirements and intermissions of brahma but i must not egotize and generalize to the end of my sheet as i have a message or two to declare i enclose a bill of exchange on the barings for thirtysix pounds which is the sum of two recent payments of munroe and of little and brown whereof i do not despair you shall yet have some account in booksellers figures i have got so far with clark as to have his consent to audit the accounts when i shall get energy and time enough to compile them out of my ridiculous journal munroe begs me to say what possibly i have already asked for him that when the history of cromwell is ready to be seen of men you will have an entire copy of the manuscript taken and sent over to us then will he print a cheap edition such as no one will undersell and secure such a share of profit to the author as the cheap press allows perhaps only thirty or forty pounds would make it worth while to take the trouble a valued friend of mine wishes to know who wrote perhaps three years ago a series of metaphysical articles in blackwood on consciousness can you remember and tell me and now i commend you to the good god you and your history and the true kind wife who is always good to the eager yankees and am yours heartily rw emerson xci carlyle to emerson chelsea april dear emerson till within five minutes of the limit of my time i had forgotten that this was the d of the month that i had a letter to write acknowledging even money take the acknowledgment given in all haste not without a gratitude that will last longer the thirtysix pounds and odd shillings came safe in your letter a new unlookedfor gift america i think is like an amiable family teapot you think it is all out long since and lo the valuable implement yields you another cup and another many thanks to you who are the heart of america to me republishing for ones friends sake i find on consulting my bookseller is out here we have pirates waiting for every american thing of mark as you have for every british to the tender mercies of these on both sides i fancy the business must be committed they do good too as all does even carrion they send you faster abroad if the world have any use for you oftenest it only thinks it has your essays the pirated essays make an ugly yellow tatter of a pamphlet price s d but the edition is all sold i understand and even nickerson has not entirely ceased to sell the same pirate who pounced upon you made an attempt the other day on my poor life of schiller but i put the due spoke in his wheel they have sent me lowells poems they are bringing out jean pauls life c c the hungry canaille it is strange that men should feel themselves so entirely at liberty to steal simply because there is no gallows to hang them for doing it your new book will be eagerly waited for by that class of persons and also by another class which is daily increasing here the only other thing i am not to forget is that of the essay on consciousness in blackwood the writer of those papers is one ferrier a nephew of the edinburgh miss ferrier who wrote marriage and some other novels nephew also of professor wilson christopher north and married to one of his daughters a man of perhaps fiveandthirty i remember him in boyhood while he was boarded with an annandale clergyman i have seen him since manhood and liked him well a solid squarevisaged dark kind of man more like your theodore parker than any mutual specimen i can recollect he got the usual education of an edinburgh advocate but found no practice at the bar nor sought any with due anxiety i believe addicted himself to logical meditations became the other year professor of universal history or some such thing in the edinburgh university and lectures with hardly any audience a certain young public wanted me to be that professor there but i knew better is this enough about ferrier i will not add another word the time being past irretrievable except by halfrunning write us your book and be well and happy always the signature has been cut off xcii carlyle to emerson chelsea august dear emerson there had been a long time without direct news from you till four days ago your letter arrived this day i understand to be the ultimate limit of the american mail yesterday had it not been sunday would have been the limit i write a line therefore though in very great haste poor sterling even i now begin to fear is in a very bad way he had two successive attacks of spitting of blood some three months ago or more the second attack of such violence and his previous condition then so weak that the doctor as good as gave up hope the poor patient himself had from the first given it up our poor friend has had so many attacks of that nature and so rapidly always rallied from them i gave no ear to these sinister prognostics but now that i see the summer influences passing over him without visible improvement and our good weather looking towards a close without so much strength added as will authorize even a new voyage to madeira i too am at last joining in the general discouragement all the sadder to me that i shut it out so long sir james clark our bestaccredited physician for such diseases declares that life for certain months may linger with great pain but that recovery is not to be expected great part of the lungs it appears is totally unserviceable for respiration from the remainder especially in times of coughing it is with the greatest difficulty that breath enough is obtained our poor patient passes the night in a sitting posture cannot lie down that fact sticks with me ever since i heard it he is very weak very pale still writes a great deal daily but does not wish to see anybody declines to see even carlyle who offered to go to him his only brother anthony sterling a hardy soldier lately withdrawn from the army and settled in this quarter whom we often communicate with is about going down to the isle of wight this week he saw john four days ago and brings nothing but bad news of which indeed this removal of his to the neighborhood of the scene is a practical testimony the old father a widower for the last two years and very lonely and dispirited seems getting feebler and feebler he was here yesterday a pathetic kind of spectacle to us alas alas but what can be said i say nothing i have written only one note to sterling i feel it probable that i shall never see him more nor his like again in this world his disease as i have from of old construed it is a burning of him up by his own fire the restless vehemence of the man struggling in all ways these many years to find a legitimate outlet and finding except for transitory unsatisfactory coruscations none has undermined its clay prison in the weakest point which proves to be the lungs and will make outlet there my poor sterling it is an old tragedy and very stern whenever it repeats itself of new today i get answer about alfred tennyson all is right on that side moxon informs me that the russell books and letter arrived duly and were duly forwarded and safely received nay farther that tennyson is now in town and means to come and see me of this latter result i shall be very glad alfred is one of the few british or foreign figures a not increasing number i think who are and remain beautiful to me a true human soul or some authentic approximation thereto to whom your own soul can say brother however i doubt he will not come he often skips me in these brief visits to town skips everybody indeed being a man solitary and sad as certain men are dwelling in an element of gloom carrying a bit of chaos about him in short which he is manufacturing into cosmos alfred is the son of a lincolnshire gentleman farmer i think indeed you see in his verses that he is a native of moated granges and green fat pastures not of mountains and their torrents and storms he had his breeding at cambridge as if for the law or church being master of a small annuity on his fathers decease he preferred clubbing with his mother and some sisters to live unpromoted and write poems in this way he lives still now here now there the family always within reach of london never in it he himself making rare and brief visits lodging in some old comrades rooms i think he must be under forty not much under it one of the finestlooking men in the world a great shock of rough dustydark hair brightlaughing hazel eyes massive aquiline face most massive yet most delicate of sallowbrown complexion almost indianlooking clothes cynically loose freeandeasy smokes infinite tobacco his voice is musical metallic fit for loud laughter and piercing wail and all that may lie between speech and speculation free and plenteous i do not meet in these late decades such company over a pipe we shall see what he will grow to he is often unwell very chaotic his way is through chaos and the bottomless and pathless not handy for making out many miles upon o paper i trust there is now joy in place of pain in the house at concord and a certain mother grateful again to the supreme powers we are all in our customary health here or nearly so my wife has been in lancashire among her kindred there for a month lately our swollen city is getting empty and still we think of trying an autumn here this time get your book ready there are readers ready for it and be busy and victorious ever yours t carlyle my history is frightful if i live it is like to be completed but whether i shall live and not rather be buried alive brokenhearted in the serbonian quagmires of english stupidity and so sleep beside cromwell often seems uncertain erebus has no uglier brutaler element let us say nothing of it let us do it or leave it to the devils ay de mi xciii emerson to carlyle boston september my dear carlyle i have just learned that in an hour mr wilmers mailbag for london by the acadia closes and i will not lose the occasion of sending you a hasty line though i had designed to write you from home on sundry matters which now must wait i send by this steamer some sheets to the bookseller john chapman proofsheets of my new book of essays chapman wrote to me by the last steamer urging me to send him some manuscript that had not yet been published in america and he thought he could make an advantage from printing it and even in some conditions procure a copyright and he would publish for me on the plan of halfprofits the request was so timely since i was not only printing a book but also a pamphlet an address to citizens of some thirteen towns who celebrated in concord the negro emancipation on st august last that i came to town yesterday and hastened the printers and have now sent him proofs of all the address and of more than half the book if you can give chapman any counsel or save me from any nonsense by enjoining on him careful correction you shall i looked eagerly for a letter from you by the last steamer to give me exact tidings of sterling none came but i received a short note from sterling himself which intimated that he had but a few more days to live it is gloomy news i beg you will write me everything you can relate of him by the next mail if you can learn from his friends whether the packet of his manuscripts and printed papers returned by russell and sent by me through harndens express to ventnor arrived safely it would be a satisfaction yours affectionately rw emerson xciv carlyle to emerson chelsea september dear emerson there should a letter have come for you by that steamer for i wrote one duly and posted it in good time myself i will hope therefore it was but some delay of some subaltern official such as i am told occasionally chances and that you got the letter after all in a day or two it would give you notice more or less up to its date of all the points you had inquired about there is now little to be added except concerning the main point that the catastrophe has arrived there as we foresaw and all is ended john sterling died at his house in ventnor on the night of wednesday th september about eleven oclock unexpectedly at last and to appearance without pain his sisterinlaw mrs maurice had gone down to him from this place about a week before other friends were waiting as it were in view of him but he wished generally to be alone to continue to the last setting his house and his heart more and more in order for the great journey for about a fortnight back he had ceased to have himself formally dressed had sat only in his dressinggown but i believe was still daily wheeled into his library and sat very calmly sorting and working there he sent me two notes and various messages and gifts of little keepsakes to my wife and myself the notes were brief stern and loving altogether noble never to be forgotten in this world his brother anthony who had been in the isle of wight within call for several weeks had now come up to town again but after about a week decided that he would run down again and look he arrived on the wednesday night about nine oclock found no visible change the brave patient calm as ever ready to speak as ever to say in direct words which he would often do or indirectly as his whole speech and conduct did god is great anthony and he talked for a while then took leave for the night in few minutes more anthony was summoned to the bedside and at eleven oclock as i said the curtain dropt and it was all ended euge whether the american manuscripts had arrived i do not yet know but probably shall before this letter goes for anthony is to return hither on tuesday and i will inquire our friend is buried in ventnor churchyard four big elms overshadow the little spot it is situated on the southeast side of that green island on the slope of steep hills as i understand it that look toward the sun and are close within sight and hearing of the sea there shall he rest and have fit lullaby this brave one he has died as a man should like an old roman yet with the christian bibles and all newest revelations present to him he refused to see friends men whom i think he loved as well as any me for one when i obliquely proposed it he refused he was even a little stern on his nearest relatives when they came to him do i need your help to die phocionlike he seemed to feel degraded by physical decay to feel that he ought to wrap his mantle round him and say i come persephoneia it is not i that linger his sisterinlaw anthonys wife probably about a month ago while they were still in wight had begged that she might see him yet once her husband would be there too she engaged not to speak anthony had not yet persuaded him when she finding the door half open went in his pale changed countenance almost made her shriek she stept forward silently kissed his brow in silence he burst into tears let us speak no more of this a great quantity of papers i understand are left for my determination what is to be done with them i will sacredly endeavor to do i have visited your bookseller chapman seen the proofsheets lying on his table taken order that the reprint shall be well corrected indeed i am to read every sheet myself and in that way get acquainted with it before it go into stereotype chapman is a tall lank youth of fiveandtwenty full of good will but of what other equipment time must yet try by a little book of his which i looked at some months ago he seemed to me sunk very deep in the dusthole of extinct socinianism a painful predicament for a man he is not sure of saving much copyright for you but he will do honestly what in that respect is doable and he will print the book correctly and publish it decently i saying imprimatur if occasion be and your ever increasing little congregation here will do with the new word what they can i add no more today reserving a little nook for the answer i hope to get two days hence adieu my friend it is silent sunday the populace not yet admitted to their beer shops till the respectabilities conclude their rubric mummeries a much more audacious feat than beer we have wet wind at northeast and a sky somewhat of the dreariest courage a little way above it reigns mere blue and sunshine eternally tc wednesday october d the letter had to wait till today and is still in time anthony sterling who is yet at ventnor apprises me this morning that according to his and the governesss belief the russell manuscripts arrived duly and were spoken of more than once by our friend on monday i received from this same anthony a big packet by post it contains among other things all your letters to john wrapt up carefully and addressed in his hand emersons letters to be returned through the hands of carlyle they shall go towards you next week by mr james who is about returning among the other papers was one containing seven stanzas of verse addressed to t carlyle th september full of love and enthusiasm the friday before his death i was visiting the old city of winchester that day among the tombs of canutes and eldest noble ones you may judge how sacred the memory of those hours now is i have read your slavery address this morning the first half sheet in proof of the essays has come perfectly correct and right good reading yours ever t carlyle xcv emerson to carlyle concord september my dear friend i enclose a bill of exchange for thirty pounds sterling which i procured in town today at each pound or so high it seems is the rate at present higher they said than for years it is good booksellers money from little and brown and james munroe co in unequal proportions if you wish for more accurate information and have a great deal of patience there is still hope that you may obtain it before death for i this day met ep clark in washington street and he reported some progress in auditing of accounts and said that when presently his family should return to town for the winter he would see to the end of them ie the accounts i received with great satisfaction your letter of july which came by a later steamer than it was written for but gave me exact and solid information on what i most wished to know may you live forever and may your reports of men and things be accessible to me whilst i live even if as now in sterlings case the news are the worst or nearly so yet let whatever comes for knowledge be precise for the direst tragedy that is accurately true must share the blessing of the universe i have no later tidings from sterling and i must still look to you to tell me what you can i dread that the story should be short may you have much good to tell of him and for many a day to come the sketch you drew of tennyson was right welcome for he is an old favorite of mine i owned his book before i saw your face though i love him with allowance o cherish him with love and praise and draw from him whole books full of new verses yet the only point on which you never give precise intelligence is your own book but you shall have your will in that so only you arrive on the shores of light at last with your mystic freight fished partly out of the seas of time and partly out of the empyrean deeps i have much regretted a sudden note i wrote you just before the steamer of september sailed entreating you to cumber yourself about my proofsheets sent to the london bookseller i heartily absolve you from all such vexations nothing could be more inconsiderate mr chapman is undoubtedly amply competent to ordinary correction and i much prefer to send you my little book in decent trim than in rags and stains and deformities more than its own i have just corrected and sent to the steamer the last sheets for mr chapman who is to find english readers if he can i shall ask mr chapman to send you a copy for his edition will be more correct than mine what can i tell you better why even this that this house rejoices in a brave boy now near three months old edward we call him and my wife calls him edward waldo when shall i show him to you and when shall i show you a pretty pasture and woodlot which i bought last week on the borders of a lake which is the chief ornament of this town called walden pond one of these days if i should have any money i may build me a cabin or a turret there high as the tree tops and spend my nights as well as days in the midst of a beauty which never fades for me yours with love rw emerson xcvi carlyle to emerson chelsea november dear emerson by the clearest law i am bound to write you a word today were my haste even greater than it is the last american fleet or ship about the middle of last month brought me a draft for thirty pounds which i converted into ready cash and have here and am now your grateful debtor for as of old there seems to be no end to those boston booksellers i think the well is dry and straightway it begins to run again thanks to you it is i dare say a thing you too are grateful for we will recognize it among the good things of this rather indifferent world by the way if that good clark like his business let him go on with it but if not stop him poor fellow it is to me a matter of really small moment whether those booksellers accounts be ever audited in this world or left over to the general day of audit i myself shudder at the sight of such things and make my bargain here so always as to have no trade with them but to be netto from the first why should i plague poor clark with them if it be any plague to him the booksellers will never know but we examine them the very terror of clarks name will be as the bark of chained mastiff and no need for actual biting have due pity on the man your english volume of essays as chapman probably informs you by this post was advertised yesterday with a preface from me that is hardly accurate that latter clause my preface consists only of a certificate that the book is correctly printed and sent forth by a publisher of your appointment whom therefore all readers of yours ought to regard accordingly nothing more there proves i believe no visible real vestige of a copyright obtainable here only chapman asserts that he has obtained one and that he will take all contraveners into chancery which has a terrible sound and indeed the act he founds on is of so distracted inextricable a character it may mean anything and all things and no sergeant talfourd whom we could consult durst take upon him to say that it meant almost anything whatever the sound of chancery the stereotype character of this volume and its cheap price may perhaps deter pirates who are but a weak body in this country as yet i judged it right to help in that and impertinent at this stage of affairs to go any farther the book is very fairly printed onward at least to the essay new england politics where my perfectcopy of the sheets as yet stops i did not read any of the proofs except two finding it quite superfluous and a sad waste of time to the hurried chapman himself i have found yet but one error and that a very correctable one narvest for harvest no other that i recollect at present the work itself falling on me by driblets has not the right chance yet not till i get it in the bound state and read it all at once to produce its due impression on me but i will say already of it it is a sermon to me as all your other deliberate utterances are a real word which i feel to be such alas almost or altogether the one such in a world all full of jargons hearsays echoes and vain noises which cannot pass with me for words this is a praise far beyond any literary one literary praises are not worth repeating in comparison for the rest i have to object still what you will call objecting against the law of nature that we find you a speaker indeed but as it were a soliloquizer on the eternal mountaintops only in vast solitudes where men and their affairs lie all hushed in a very dim remoteness and only the man and the stars and the earth are visible whom so fine a fellow seems he we could perpetually punch into and say why wont you come and help us then we have terrible need of one man like you down among us it is cold and vacant up there nothing paintable but rainbows and emotions come down and you shall do lifepictures passions facts which transcend all thought and leave it stuttering and stammering to which he answers that he wont cant and doesnt want to as the cockneys have it and so i leave him and say you western gymnosophist well we can afford one man for that too but by the bye i ought to say the sentences are very brief and did not in my sheet reading always entirely cohere for me pure genuine saxon strong and simple of a clearness of a beauty but they did not sometimes rightly stick to their foregoers and their followers the paragraph not as a beaten ingot but as a beautiful square bag of duckshot held together by canvas i will try them again with the book deliberately before me there are also one or two utterances about jesus immortality and so forth which will produce wideeyes here and there i do not say it was wrong to utter them a man obeys his own daemon in these cases as his supreme law i dare say you are a little bored occasionally with jesus c as i confess i myself am when i discern what a beggarly twaddle they have made of all that what a greasy cataplasm to lay to their own poltrooneries and an impatient person may exclaim with voltaire in serious moments au nom de dieu ne me parlez plus de cet hommela i have had enough of him i tell you i am alive too well i have scribbled at a great rate regardless of times flight my wife thanks many times for m fullers book i sent by mr james a small packet of your letters which will make you sad to look at them adieu dear friend t carlyle xcvii emerson to carlyle concord december my dear friend i have long owed you a letter and have much to acknowledge your two letters containing tidings the first of the mortal illness and the second of the death of sterling i had no heart to answer i had nothing to say alas as in so many instances heretofore i knew not what to think life is somewhat customary and usual and death is the unusual and astonishing it kills in so far the survivor also when it ravishes from him friendship and the most noble and admirable qualities that which we call faith seems somewhat stoical and selfish if we use it as a retreat from the pangs this ravishment inflicts i had never seen him but i held him fast now i see him not but i can no longer hold him who can say what he yet is and will be to me the most just and generous can best divine that i have written in vain to james to visit me or to send me tidings he sent me without any note the parcel you confided to him and has gone to albany or i know not whither i have your notes of the progress of my london printing and at last the book itself it was thoughtless in me to ask your attention to the book at all in the proof state the printer might have been fully trusted with corrected printed pages before him nor should chapman have taxed you for an advertisement only i doubt not he was glad of a chance to have business with you and of course was too thankful for any preface thanks to you for the kind thought of a notice and for its friendly wit you shall not do this thing again if i should send you any more books a preface from you is a sort of banner or oriflamme a little too splendid for my occasion and misleads i fancy my readers to be a very quiet plain even obscure class men and women of some religious culture and aspirations young or else mystical and by no means including the great literary and fashionable army which no man can count who now read your books if you introduce me your readers and the literary papers try to read me and with false expectations i had rather have fewer readers and only such as belong to me i doubt not your stricture on the book as sometimes unconnected and inconsecutive is just your words are very gentle i should describe it much more harshly my knowledge of the defects of these things i write is all but sufficient to hinder me from writing at all i am only a sort of lieutenant here in the deplorable absence of captains and write the laws ill as thinking it a better homage than universal silence you londoners know little of the dignities and duties of country lyceums but of what you say now and heretofore respecting the remoteness of my writing and thinking from real life though i hear substantially the same criticism made by my countrymen i do not know what it means if i can at any time express the law and the ideal right that should satisfy me without measuring the divergence from it of the last act of congress and though i sometimes accept a popular call and preach on temperance or the abolition of slavery as lately on the st of august i am sure to feel before i have done with it what an intrusion it is into another sphere and so much loss of virtue in my own since i am not to see you from year to year is there never an englishman who knows you well who comes to america and whom you can send to me to answer all my questions health and love and joy to you and yours rw emerson xcviii emerson to carlyle concord january my dear carlyle carey and hart of philadelphia booksellers have lately proposed to buy the remainder of our boston edition of your miscellanies or to give you a bonus for sanctioning an edition of the same which they propose to publish on inquiry i have found that only thirteen entire sets of four volumes remain to us unsold whilst we have copies of volume iii and copies of volume iv remaining in replying to mr carey i proposed that besides the proposed bonus he should buy of me these old volumes which are not bound but folded at cents a volume monroe having roughly computed the cost at cents a volume but this he declines to do and offers fifty pounds sterling for his bonus i decided at once to accept his offer thinking it a more favorable winding up of our account than i could otherwise look for as mr carey knows much better how to defend himself from pirates than i do so i am to publish that his edition is edited with your concurrence our own remaining copies of entire sets i shall sell at once to monroe at a reduced price and the odd volumes i think to dispose of by giving them a new and independent titlepage in the circumstances of the trade here i think mr careys offer a very liberal one and he is reputed in his dealings eminently just and generous my friend william furness who has corresponded with me on careys behalf has added now another letter to say that mr carey wishes to procure a picture of mr carlyle to be engraved for this edition he understands there is a good head by laurence and he wishes to employ some london artist to make a copy of it in oil or water colors or in any way that will suffice for the engraver and he proposes to apply to mr carlyle for permission through inman the american artist who is now in england furness goes on to ask for my good word with you in furtherance of this design well i heartily hope you will not resist so much good nature and true love for mr furness and mr griswold and others who compose a sort of advising committee to mr carey are sincere lovers of yours one more opportunity this crisis in our accounts will give to that truest of all carlylians ep clark to make his report i called at his house two nights ago in boston he promised immediate attention but quickly drew me aside to his illustrations of carlyle an endless train of books and portfolios and boxes of prints in which every precious word of that master is explained or confirmed affectionately yours rw emerson xcix carlyle to emerson chelsea february dear emerson by the last packet which sailed on the d of the month i forgot to write to you though already in your debt one letter and there now has another letter arrived which on the footing of mere business demands to be answered i write straightway not knowing how the postoffice people will contrive the conveyance or whether it can be sooner than by the next steam ship but willing to give them a chance you have made another brave bargain for me with the philadelphia people to all of which i can say nothing but euge papae it seems to me strange in the present state of copyright how my sanction or the contrary can be worth l to any american bookseller but so it is to all appearance let it be so therefore with thanks and surprise the messrs carey and lea distinguish themselves by the beauty of their editions a poor author does not go abroad among his friends in dirty paper full of misprints under their guidance this is as handsome an item of the business as any as to the portrait too i will be as amiable as heart could wish truly it will be worth my while to take a little pains that the kind philadelphia editors do once for all get a faithful portrait of me since they are about it and so prevent counterfeits from getting into circulation i will endeavor to do in that matter whatsoever they require of me to the extent even of sitting two days for a crayon sketch such as may be engraved though this new sacrifice of patience will not be needed as matters are it stands thus there is no painter of the numbers who have wasted my time and their own with trying that has indicated any capability of catching a true likeness but one samuel lawrence a young painter of real talent not quite so young now but still only struggling for complete mastership in the management of colors he does crayon sketches in a way to please almost himself but his oil paintings at least till within a year or two have indicated only a great faculty still crude in that particular his oil portrait of me which you speak of is almost terrible to behold it has the look of a jotun of a scandinavian demon grim sad as the angel of death and the coloring is so brickish the finishing so coarse it reminds you withal of a flayed horses head dinna speak ot but the preparatory crayonsketch of this still in existence is admired by some judges poor john sterling bought it from the painter and it is now here in the hands of his brother who will readily allow any authorized person to take a drawing of it lawrence himself i imagine would be the fittest man to employ or your mr ingham inman if he be here and a capable person one or both of these might superintend the engraving of it here and not part with the plate till it were pronounced satisfactory in short i am willing to do anything in reason only if a portrait is to be i confess i should rather avoid going abroad under the hands of bunglers at least of bunglers sanctioned by myself there is a portrait of me in some miserable farrago called spirit of the age a farrago unknown to me but a portrait known for poor lawrence brought it down to me with sorrow in his face it professes to be from his painting is a lais without the beauty as charles lamb used to say a flayed horses head without the spiritualism good or bad and simply figures on my mind as a detestability which i had much rather never have seen these poor spirit of the age people applied to me i described myself as busy c shoved them off me and this monster of iniquity resembling nothing in the earth or under it is the result in short i am willing i am willing and so let us not waste another drop of ink on it at present on the whole are not you a strange fellow you apologize as if with real pain for trouble i had or indeed am falsely supposed to have had with chapman here and forthwith engage again in correspondences in speculations and negotiations and i know not what on my behalf for shame for shame nay you have done one very ingenious thing to set clark upon the boston booksellers accounts it is excellent michael scott setting the devil to twist ropes of sand there my brave one see if you dont find work there for a while i never think of this clark without love and laughter once more euge chapman is fast selling your books here striking off a new five hundred from his stereotypes you are wrong as to your public in this country it is a very pretty public extends pretty much i believe through all ranks and is a growing one and a truly aristocratic being of the bravest inquiring minds we have all things are breaking up here like swedish frost in the end of march gachis epouvantable deep very serious eternal instincts are at work but as yet no serious word at all that i hear except what reaches me from concord at intervals forward forward and you do not know what i mean by calling you unpractical theoretic caeca corda but i have no room for such a theme at present a new spirit of the age edited by rh horne in two volumes london the reason i tell you nothing about cromwell is alas that there is nothing to be told i am day and night these long months and years very miserable about it nigh brokenhearted often such a scandalous accumulation of human stupidity in every form never lay before on such a subject no history of it can be written to this wretched fleering sneering canting twaddling god forgetting generation how can you explain men to apes by the dead sea and i am very sickly too and my wife is ill all this cold weather and i am sunk in the bowels of chaos and scarce once in the three months or so see so much as a possibility of ever getting out cromwells own letters and speeches i have gathered together and washed clean from a thousand ordures these i do sometimes think of bringing out in a legible shape perhaps soon adieu dear friend with blessings always t carlyle poor sydney smith is understood to be dying water on the chest past hope of doctors alas the dwellers by the dead sea who were changed to apes are referred to in various places by carlyle he tells the story of the metamorphosis which he got from the introduction to sales koran in past and present book iii ch c emerson to carlyle concord june my dear friend i grieve to think of my slackness in writing which suffers steamer after steamer to go without a letter but i have still hoped before each of the late packets sailed that i should have a message to send that would enforce a letter i wrote you some time ago of mr careys liberal proposition in relation to your miscellanies i wrote of course to furness through whom it was made to me accepting the proposition and i forwarded to mr carey a letter from me to be printed at the beginning of the book signifying your goodwill to the edition and acknowledging the justice and liberality of the publishers i have heard no more from them and now a fortnight since the newspaper announces the death of mr carey he died very suddenly though always an invalid and extremely crippled his death is very much regretted in the philadelphia papers where he bore the reputation of a most liberal patron of good and fine arts i have not heard from mr furness and have thought i should still expect a letter from him i hope our correspondence will stand as a contract which mr careys representatives will feel bound to execute they had sent me a little earlier a copy of mr sartains engraving from their watercolor copy of laurences head of you they were eager to have the engraving pronounced a good likeness i showed it to sumner and russell and theodore parker who have seen you long since i had and they shook their heads unanimously and declared that dorsays profile was much more like from the rough draft i creep along the roads and fields of this town as i have done from year to year when my garden is shamefully overgrown with weeds i pull up some of them i prune my apples and pears i have a few friends who gild many hours of the year i sometimes write verses i tell you with some unwillingness as knowing your distaste for such things that i have received so many applications from readers and printers for a volume of poems that i have seriously taken in hand the collection transcription or scription of such a volume and may do the enormity before new years day fear not dear friend you shall not have to read one line perhaps i shall send you an official copy but i shall appeal to the tenderness of jane carlyle and excuse your formidable self for the benefit of us both where all writing is such a caricature of the subject what signifies whether the form is a little more or less ornate and luxurious meantime i think to set a few heads before me as good texts for winter evening entertainments i wrote a deal about napoleon a few months ago after reading a library of memoirs now i have plato montaigne and swedenborg and more in the clouds behind what news of naseby and worcester ci carlyle to emerson chelsea august dear emerson your letter which had been very long expected has been in my hand above a month now and still no answer sent to it i thought of answering straightway but the day went by days went by and at length i decided to wait till my insupportable burden the stupidity of two centuries as i call it which is a heavy load for one man were rolled off my shoulders and i could resume the habit of writing letters which has almost left me for many months by the unspeakable blessing of heaven that consummation has now arrived about four days ago i wrote my last word on cromwells letters and speeches and one of the earliest uses i make of my recovered freedom is to salute you again the book is nearly printed two big volumes about a half of it i think my own the real utterances of the man oliver cromwell once more legible to earnest men legible really to an unexpected extent for the book took quite an unexpected figure in my hands and is now a kind of life of oliver the best that circumstances would permit me to do whether either i or england shall be in my time fit for a better remains submitted to the destinies at present i have tied up the whole puritan paperlitter considerable masses of it still unburnt with tight strings and hidden it at the bottom of my deepest repositories there shall it if heaven please lie dormant for a time and times such an element as i have been in no human tongue can give account of the disgust of my soul has been great a really pious labor worth very little when i have done it but the best i could do and that is quite enough i feel the liveliest gratitude to the gods that i have got out of it alive the book is very dull but it is actually legible all the ingenious faculty i had and ten times as much would have been useful there has been employed in elucidation in saying and chiefly in forbearing to say in annihilating continents of brutal wreck and dung ach gott but in fact you will see it by and by and then form your own conclusions about it they are going to publish it in october i find i tried hard to get you a complete copy of the sheets by this steamer but it proves to be flatly impossible perhaps luckily for i think you would have been bothering yourself with some new bookseller negotiation about it and that as copyright and other matters now stand is a thing i cannot recommend enough of it now only let all my silences and other shortcomings be explained thereby i am now off for the north country for a snatch still at the small remnants of summer and a little free air and sunshine i am really far from well though i have been riding diligently for three months back and doing what i could to help myself very glad shall i be my friend to have some new utterances from you either in verse or in prose what you say about the vast imperfection of all modes of utterance is most true indeed let a man speak and sing and do and sputter and gesticulate as he may the meaning of him is most ineffectually shown forth poor fellow rather indicated as if by straggling symbols than spoken or visually expressed poor fellow so the great rule is that he have a good manful meaning and then that he take what mode of utterance is honestly the readiest for him i wish you would take an american hero one whom you really love and give us a history of him make an artistic bronze statue in good words of his life and him i do indeed but speak of what you will you are welcome to me once more i say no other voice in this wide waste world seems to my sad ear to be speaking at all at present the more is the pity for us i forbid you to plague yourself any farther with those philadelphia or other booksellers if you could hinder them to promulgate any copy of that frightful picture by lawrence or indeed any picture at all i had rather stand as a shadow than as a falsity in the minds of my american friends but this too we are prepared to encounter and as for the money of these men if they will pay it good and welcome if they will not pay it let them keep it with what blessing there may be in it i have your noble offices in that and in other such matters already unforgetably sure to me and in real fact that is almost exactly the whole of valuable that could exist for me in the affair adieu dear friend write to me again i will write again at more leisure yours always t carlyle cii emerson to carlyle concord september my dear friend i have seen furness of philadelphia who was last week in boston and inquired of him what account i should send you of the new philadelphia edition has not mr carey paid you he said no then has he not paid carlyle directly no as i believe or i should have heard of it furness replied that the promised fifty pounds were sure and that the debt would have been settled before this time if mr carey had lived so as this is no longer a three blind callenders business of arabian nights i shall rest secure i have doubted whether the bad name which philadelphia has gotten in these times would not have disquieted you in this long delay if you have ever heard directly from carey and hart you will inform me i am to read to a society in boston presently some lectures on plato or the philosopher swedenborg or the mystic montaigne or the sceptic shakespeare or the poet napoleon or the man of the world if i dare and much lecturing makes us incorrigibly rash perhaps before i end it my list will be longer and the measure of presumption overflowed i may take names less reverend than some of these but six lectures i have promised i find this obligation usually a good spur to the sides of that dull horse i have charge of but many of its advantages must be regarded at a long distance i have heard nothing from you for a long time so may your writing prosper the more i wish to hear however concerning you and your house and your studies when there is little to tell the steamers come so fast to exchange cards would not be nothing my wife and children and my mother are well peace and love to your household rw emerson ciii emerson to carlyle concord september my dear friend i had hardly sent away my letter by the last steamer when yours full of good news arrived i greet you heartily on the achievement of your task and the new days of freedom obtained and deserved happiest first that you can work which seems the privilege of the great and then also that thereby you can come at the sweetness of victory and rest yes flee to the country ride run leap sit spread yourself at large and in all ways celebrate the immense benevolence of the universe towards you and never complain again of dyspepsia crosses or the folly of men for in giving you this potent concentration what has been withholden i am glad with all men that a new book is made that the gentle creation as well as the grosser goes ever on another month will bring it to me and i shall know the secrets of these late silent years welcome the child of my friend why should i regret that i see you not when you are forced thus intimately to discover yourself beyond the intimacy of conversation but you should have sent me out the sheets by the last steamer or a manuscript copy of the book i do not know but munroe would have printed it at once and defied the penny press and slow time might have brought in his hands a most modest reward i wrote you the other day the little i had to say on affairs clark the financial conscience has never yet made any report though often he promised half the year he lives out of boston and unless i go to his bank i never see his face i think he will not die till he have disburdened himself of this piece of arithmetic i pray you to send me my copy of this book at the earliest hour and to offer my glad congratulations to jane carlyle on an occasion i am sure of great peace and relief to her spirit and so farewell rw emerson civ carlyle to emerson chelsea november my dear emerson i have had two letters from you since i wrote any the latest of them was lying here for me when i returned about three weeks ago the other i had received in scotland it was only the last that demanded a special answer which alas i meant faithfully to give it but did not succeed with meet despatch i made the bookseller get ready for you a copy of the unpublished cromwell book hardly complete as yet it was nevertheless put together and even some kind of odious rudiments of a portrait were bound up with it and the packet inscribed with your address was put into wiley and putnams hands in time for the mail steamer and i hope has duly arrived if it have not pray set the booksellers ahunting wiley and putnam was the carriers name this is all the indication i can give but this i hope if indeed any prove needful will be enough one may hope you have the book already in your hands a fortnight before this reaches you a month before any other copy can reach america in which case the parcel without any letter must have seemed a little enigmatic to you the reason was this i miscounted the day of the month unlucky that i was sitting down one morning with full purpose to write at large and all my tools round me i discover that it is no longer the third of november that it is already the fourth and the american mailpacket has already lifted anchor irrevocable irremediable nothing remained but to wait for the th and now as you see to take time by the forelock queue as we all know he has none my visit to scotland was wholesome for me tho full of sadness as the like always is thirty years mow away a generation of men the old hills the old brooks and houses are still there but the population has marched away almost all it is not there any more i cannot enter into light talk with the survivors and successors i withdraw into silence and converse with the old dumb crags rather in a melancholy and abstruse manner thank god my good old mother is still there old and frail but still young of heart as young and strong there i think as ever it is beautiful to see affection survive where all else is submitting to decay the altar with its sacred fire still burning when the outer walls are all slowly crumbling material fate saying they are mine i read some insignificant books smoked a great deal of tobacco and went moping about among the hills and hollow watercourses somewhat like a shade in hades the gospel which this world of fact does preach to one differs considerably from the sugary twaddle one gets the offer of in exeterhall and other spoutingplaces of which in fact i am getting more and more weary sometimes really impatient it seems to me the reign of cant and spoonyism has about lasted long enough alas in many respects in this england i too often feel myself sorrowfully in a minority of one if in the whole world it amount to a minority of two that is something these words of goethe often come into my mind verachtung ja nicht achtung lancashire with its titanic industries with its smoke and dirt and brutal stupor to all but money and the five mechanical powers did not excite much admiration in me considerably less i think than ever patience and shuffle the cards the book on cromwell is not to come out till the d of this month for many weeks it has been a real weariness to me my hope always disappointed that now is the last time i shall have any trade with it even since i began writing there has been an engraver here requiring new indoctrination poor fellow nay in about ten days it must be over let us not complain i feel it well to be worth nothing except for the little fractions or intermittent fits of pious industry there really were in it and my one wish is that the human species would be pleased to take it off my hands and honestly let me hear no more about it if it please heaven i will rest awhile still and then try something better in three days hence my wife and i are off to the hampshire coast for a winter visit to kind friends there if in such a place it will prosper long with us the climate there is greatly better than ours they are excellent people well affected to us and can be lived with though of high temper and ways they are the lord ashburtons in fact more properly the younger stratum of that house partly a kind of american people who know waldo emerson among other fine things very well i think we are to stay some three weeks the bustle of moving is already begun you promise us a new book soon let it be soon then there are many persons here that will welcome it now to one man here it is ever as an articulate voice amid the infinite cackling and cawing that remains my best definition of the effect it has on me adieu my friend good be with you and your household always vale tc cv carlyle to emerson chelsea january dear emerson i received your letter by the last packet three or four days ago this is the last day of answering the monthly packet sails towards you again from liverpool tomorrow morning and i am in great pressure with many writings elsewhither and thither therefore i must be very brief i have just written to mr hart of philadelphia his draft as i judge clearly by the bankers speech and silence is accepted all right and in fact means money at this time for which i have written to thank him heartily do you very heartily thank mr furness for me furness and various friends as transatlantic matters now are must accept a silent gratitude from me the speech of men and american heroworshipers is grown such a babblement in very truth silence is the thing that chiefly has meaning there or here missing to my very great astonishment the book cromwell proves popular here and there is to be another edition very soon edition with improvements for some fifty or so of new not all insignificant letters have turned up and i must try to do something rational with them with which painful operation i am again busy it will make the two volumes about equal perhaps which will be one benefit if any american possibility lie in this i will take better care of it alas i have not got one word with you yet tell me of your lectures of all things ever yours t carlyle we returned from hampshire exactly a week ago never passed six so totally idle weeks in our lives better in health a little perhaps cvi carlyle to emerson chelsea february dear emerson one word to you before the packet sail on business of my own once more in such a state of haste as could hardly be greater the printers are upon me and i have not a moment contrary to all human expectation this book on cromwell proves salable to mankind here and a second edition is now going forward with all speed the publication of the first has brought out from their recesses a new heap of cromwell letters which have been a huge embarrassment to me for they are highly unimportant for most part and do not tend to alter or materially modify anything some fifty or sixty new letters in all many of them from printed books that had escaped me the great majority with others yet that may come in future time i determine to print simply as an appendix but several too i think about twenty in all are to be fitted into the text chiefly in the early part of the first volume as tending to bring some matters into greater clearness there i am busy with that even now sunk deep into the dustabysses again of course i have made what provision i could for printing a supplement c to the possessors of the first edition but i find this second will be the final standing edition of the book decidedly preferable to the first not to be touched by me again except on very good cause indeed new letters except they expressly contradict me shall go at once into the back apartment or appendix in future the printers have sent me some five or six sheets they send me hitherto a sheet daily but perhaps there are not above three or two in a perfect state so i trouble you with none of them by this packet but by next packet d of march unless i hear to the contrary i will send you all the sheets that are ready and so by the following packets till we are out of it that you on the scene there may do with them once for all whatsoever you like if nothing can be done with them believe me i shall be very glad of that result but if you can so much as oblige any honest bookseller of your or my acquaintance by the gift of them let it be done let pirates and ravenous bipeds of prey be excluded from participating that of itself will be a comfortable and a proper thing you are hereby authorized to promulgate in any way you please that the second edition will be augmented corrected as aforesaid and that mr any son of adam you please to name is so far as i have any voice in the matter appointed by me to the exclusion of all and sundry others on what pretext soever to print and vend the same to my american friends and so it stands and the sheets probably near thirty in number will be out with the march packet and if nothing can come of it i for one shall be very glad the book is to be in three volumes now the first ends at p vol i the third begins at p vol ii of the present edition what are you doing write to me how the lectures went how all things went and go we are over head and ears in anticornlaw here the aristocracy struck almost with a kind of horror at sight of that terrible millocracy rising like a huge hideous frankenstein up in lancashire seemingly with boundless ready money in its pocket and a very fierce humor in its stomach to me it is as yet almost uglier than the aristocracy and i will not fire guns when this small victory is gained i will recommend a day of fasting rather that such a victory required such gaining adieu my friend is it likely we shall meet in oregon think you that would be a beautiful affair on the part of the most enlightened nation yours ever t carlyle cvii carlyle to emerson chelsea march dear emerson i must write you a word before this packet go tho my haste is very great i received your two newspapers price only twopence by the same ship there came and reached me some days later a letter from mr everett enclosing the cromwell portions of the same printedmatter clipt out by scissors written it appeared by mr everetts nephew some of whose remarks especially his wish that i might once be in new england and see people praying amused me much the cotton letter c i have now got to the bottom of birchs copy is in the museum here a better edition than i had of levered and the other small american documents alas i get cartloads of the like or better tumbled down at my door and my chief duty is to front them resolutely with a shovel ten thousand tons is but a small estimate for the quantity of loose and indurated lumber i have had to send sounding on each hand of me down down to the eternal deeps never to trouble me more the jingle of it as it did at last get under way and go down was almost my one consolation in those unutterable operations i am again over head and ears but shall be out soon never to return more by this packet according to volunteer contract there goes out by the favor of your chapman a number of sheets how many i do not exactly know of the new edition chapman first and chapman second yours and mine have undertaken to manage the affair for this month and for the following months many thanks to them both for taking it out of my hands what you are to do with the article you already know if no other customer present himself can you signify to mr hart of philadelphia that the sheets are much at his service his conduct on another occasion having given him right to such an acknowledgment from me or at any rate you will want a new copy of this book and can retain the sheets for that object enough of them from mr everett i learn that your boston lectures have been attended with renown enough when are the lectures themselves to get to print i read last night an essay on you by a kind of young scotland as we might call it in an edinburgh magazine very fond of you but shocked that you were antichristian really not so bad the stupidities of men go crossing one another and miles down at the bottom of all there is a little veinlet of sense found running at last if you see mr everett will you thank him for his kind remembrance of me till i find leisure as i have vainly hoped today to do to thank him more in form a dignified compact kind of man whom i remember with real pleasure jargon abounds in our newspapers and parliament houses at present with which the present editor and indeed i think the public at large takes little concern beyond the regret of being bored by it the cornlaws are going very quietly the way of all deliriums and then there will at least be one delirium less and we shall start upon new ones not a word more today but my blessings and regards god be with you and yours always ever your affectionate t carlyle cviii carlyle to emerson chelsea april dear emerson your two letters have both come to hand the last of them only three days ago one word in answer before the packet sail one very hasty word rather than none missing you have made the best of bargains for me once again with the freest contempt of trouble on my behalf which i cannot sufficiently wonder at apparently it is a fixedidea of yours that the bibliopolic genus shall not cheat me and you are decided to make it good very well let it be so in as far as the fates will certainly i will conform in all points to this wileyandputnam treaty and faithfully observe the same the london wileys have not yet sent me any tidings but when they do i will say your terms on the other side of the sea are the law to us and it is a finished thing no sheets i think will go by this midmonth packet the printer and bookseller were bidden not mind that but by the packet of may d i hope the second volume will go complete and if the printers make speed almost the whole remainder may go by the june one there is to be a supplement to the first edition containing all the new matter that is separable of this too the wileys shall have their due copy to reprint it is what i could do to keep my faith with purchasers of the first edition here but on the whole there will be no emulating of the second edition except by a reprint of the whole of it changes great and small have had to introduce themselves everywhere as these new letters were woven in i hope before may d i shall have ascertained whether it will not be the simplest way as with my present light it clearly appears to give the sheets direct to the wiley and putnam here and let them send them in any case the cargo shall come one way or other furthermore yes you shall have that sunshadow a daguerreotype likeness as the sun shall please to paint it there has often been talk of getting me to that establishment but i never yet could go if it be possible we will have this also ready for the d of may provided you as you promise go and do likewise a strange moment that when i look upon your dead shadow again instead of the living face which remains unchanged within me enveloped in beautiful clouds and emerging now and then into strange clearness has your head grown grayish on me are gray hairs here and there and i do know it i have lived half a century in this world fifty years complete on the th of december last that is a solemn fact for me few and evil have been the days of the years of thy servant few for any good that was ever done in them ay de mi within late weeks i have got my horse again go riding through the loud torrent of vehiculatory discords till i get into the fields into the green lanes which is intrinsically a great medicine to me most comfortless riding it is with a horse of such kangaroo disposition till i do get to the sight of my old everyoung greenmantled mother again but for an hour there it is a real blessing to me i have company sometimes but generally prefer solitude and a dialogue with the trees and clouds alas the speech of men especially the wittyspeech of men is oftentimes afflictive to me in the wide earth i say sometimes with a sigh there is none but emerson that responds to me with a voice wholly human all literature too is become i cannot tell you how contemptible to me on the whole ones blessedness is to do as oliver work while the sun is up work well as if eternities depended on it and then sleep if under the guanomountains of human stupor if handsomely forgotten all at once that latter is the handsome thing i have often thought what w shakespeare would say were he to sit one night in a shakespeare society and listen to the empty twaddle and other longeared melody about him there adieu my friend i fear i have forgotten many things at all events i have forgotten the inexorable flight of the minutes which are numbered out to me at present ever yours t carlyle i think i recognize the inspector of wildbeasts in the little boston newspaper you send a small hatchetfaced gray eyed goodhumored inspector who came with a translated lafontaine and took his survey not without satisfaction comfortable too how rapidly he fathomed the animal having just poked him up a little ach gott man is forever interesting to men and all men even hatchetfaces are globular and complete this probably refers to a letter of mr elizur wrights describing a visit to carlyle cix carlyle to emerson chelsea april dear emerson here is the photograph going off for you by bookseller munroe of boston the sheets of cromwell all the second and part of the last volume are to go direct to new york both parcels by the putnam conveyance for putnam has been here since i wrote making large confirmations of what you conveyed to me and large proposals of an ulterior scope which will involve you in new trouble for me but it is trouble you will not grudge inasmuch as it promises to have some issue of moment at all events the negotiation is laid entirely into your hands therefore i must with all despatch explain to you the essentials of it that you may know what wiley says when he writes to you from new york mr putnam really a very intelligent modest and reputable looking little fellow got at last to sight of me about a week ago explained with much earnestness how the whole origin of the mistake about the first edition of cromwell had lain with chapman my own bookseller which in fact i had already perceived to be the case and farther set forth what was much more important that he and his partner were and had been ready and desirous to make good said mistake in the amplest most satisfactory manner by the ready method of paying me now ten percent on the sellingprice of all the copies of cromwell sent into the market by them and had as i knew already covenanted with you to do so in a clear bonafide and to you satisfactory manner in regard to that first edition in consequence of which you had made a bargain with them of like tenor in regard to the second to all which i could only answer that such conduct was that of men of honor and would in all manner of respects be satisfactory to me wherefore the new sheets of cromwell should now go by his package direct to new york and the other little parcel for you he could send to munroe that as one consequence yes surely intimated he but there were other consequences of more moment behind that namely that they wanted the wiley putnam house did to publish certain other books of mine the list of which i do not now recollect under similar conditions viz that i was to certify in a line or two prefixable to each book that i had read it over in preparation for their printer and did authorize them to print and sell it in return for which ten percent on the saleprice and all manner of facilities volunteered to convince even clark of boston the lynxeyed friend now busy for me looking through millstones that all was straight and said ten percent actually paid on every copy sold this was putnams offer stated with all transparency and in a way not to be misunderstood by either of us to which i answered that the terms seemed clear and square and every way good and such as i could comply with heartily so far as i was at liberty but not farther not farther for example there was hart of philadelphia i think the wileys do not want the miscellanies there were munroe little and brown c in short there was rw emerson who knew in all ways how far i was free and not free and who would take care of my integrity and interest at once and do what was just and prudent and to him i would refer the whole question and whatever he engaged for that and no other than that i would do so that you see how it is and what a coil you have again got into mr putnam would have had some letter some exchange of letters to the effect abovestated but i answered it was better we did not write at all till the matter was clear and liquid with you and then we could very swiftly write and act i would apprise you how the matter stood and expect your answer and bid you covenant with mr wiley what you found good prompt i to fulfil whatever you undertook for me this is a true picture of the affair the very truest i can write in haste and so i leave it with you ach gott if your photograph succeed as well as mine i shall be almost tragically glad of it this of me is far beyond all pictures really very like i got laurence the painter to go with me and he would not let the people off till they had actually made a likeness my wife has got another which she asserts to be much more amiablelooking and even liker o my friend it is a strange phantasmagory of a fact this huge tremendous world of ours life of ours do you bethink you of craigenputtock and the still evening there i could burst into tears if i had that habit but it is of no use the cromwell business will be ended about the end of may i do hope you say not a word of your own affairs i have vaguely been taught to look for some book shortly what of it we are well or tolerably well and the summer is come adieu blessings on you and yours tc the engraved portrait in the first volume of this correspondence is from a photograph taken from this daguerrotype cx emerson to carlyle concord may dear friend i daily expect the picture and wonder so long as i have wished it i had never asked it before i was in boston the other day and went to the best reputed daguerreotypist but though i brought home three transcripts of my face the house mates voted them rueful supremely ridiculous i must sit again or as true elizabeth hoar said i must not sit again not being of the right complexion which daguerre and iodine delight in i am minded to try once more and if the sun will not take me i must sit to a good crayon sketcher mr cheney and send you his draught good rides to you and the longest escapes from london streets i too have a new plaything the best i ever had a woodlot last fall i bought a piece of more than forty acres on the border of a little lake half a mile wide and more called walden pond a place to which my feet have for years been accustomed to bring me once or twice a week at all seasons my lot to be sure is on the further side of the water not so familiar to me as the nearer shore some of the wood is an old growth but most of it has been cut off within twenty years and is growing thriftily in these may days when maples poplars oaks birches walnut and pine are in their spring glory i go thither every afternoon and cut with my hatchet an indian path through the thicket all along the bold shore and open the finest pictures my two little girls know the road now though it is nearly two miles from my house and find their way to the spring at the foot of a pine grove and with some awe to the ruins of a village of shanties all overgrown with mullein which the irish who built the railroad left behind them at a good distance in from the shore the land rises to a rocky head perhaps sixty feet above the water thereon i think to place a hut perhaps it will have two stories and be a petty tower looking out to monadnoc and other new hampshire mountains there i hope to go with book and pen when good hours come i shall think there a fortnight might bring you from london to walden pond life wears on and do you say the gray hairs appear few can so well afford them the black have not hung over a vacant brain as england and america know nor white or black will it give itself any sabbath for many a day henceforward as i believe what have we to do with old age our existence looks to me more than ever initial we have come to see the ground and look up materials and tools the men who have any positive quality are a flying advance party for reconnoitring we shall yet have a right work and kings for competitors with ever affectionate remembrance to your wife your friend rw emerson cxi emerson to carlyle concord may my dear friend it is late at night and i have postponed writing not knowing but that my parcel would be ready to go and now a public meeting and the speech of a rarely honest and eloquent man have left me but a span of time for the mornings messenger the photograph came safely to my thorough content i have what i have wished this head is to me out of comparison more satisfying than any picture i confirm my recollections and i make new observations it is life to life thanks to the sun this artist remembers what every other forgets to report and what i wish to know the true sculpture of the features the angles the special organism the rooting of the hair the form and the placing of the head i am accustomed to expect of the english a securing of the essentials in their work and the sun does that and you have done it in this portrait which gives me much to think and feel i was instantly stirred to an emulation of your love and punctuality and last monday which was my fortythird birthday i went to a new daguerreotypist who took much pains to make his picture right i brought home three shadows not agreeable to my own eyes the machine has a bad effect on me my wife protests against the imprints as slanderous my friends say they look ten years older and as i think with the air of a decayed gentleman touched with his first paralysis however i got yesterday a trusty vote or two for sending one of them to you on the ground that i am not likely to get a better but it now seems probable that it will not get cased and into the hands of harnden in time for the steamer tomorrow it will then go by that of the th from emersons diary may in carlyles head photograph which came last night how much appears how unattainable this truth to any painter here have i the inevitable traits which the sun forgets not to copy and which i thirst to see but which no painter remembers to give me here have i the exact sculpture the form of the head the rooting of the hair thickness of the lips the man that god made and all the laurences and dorsays now serve me well as illustration i have the form and organism and can better spare the expression and color what would i not give for a head of shakespeare by the same artist of plato of demosthenes here i have the jutting brow and the excellent shape of the head and here the organism of the eye full of england the valid eye in which i see the strong executive talent which has made his thought available to the nations whilst others as intellectual as he are pale and powerless the photograph comes dated april and he writes i am fifty years old i am heartily glad that you are in direct communication with these really energetic booksellers wiley and putnam i understood from wileys letter to me weeks ago that their ambition was not less than to have a monopoly of your books i answered it is very desirable for us too saving always the rights of mr hart in philadelphia i told him you had no interest in munroes sartor which from the first was his own adventure and little and brown had never reprinted past and present or chartism the french revolution past and present chartism and the sartor i see no reason why they should not have munroe and l b have no real claims and i will speak to them but there is one good particular in putnams proffer to you which wiley has not established in his first and last agreement with me namely that you shall have an interest in what is already sold of their first edition of cromwell by all means close with putnam of the good mind exempting only harts interest i have no recent correspondence with wiley and putnam and i greatly prefer that they should deal directly with you yet it were best to leave an american reference open for audit and umpirage to the stanch ep clark of the new england bank ever yours rw emerson cxii carlyle to emerson chelsea june dear emerson i have had two letters of yours the last of them st may only two days and have seen a third written to wiley of new york yesterday putnam was here and we made our bargain and are to have it signed this day at his shop two copies one of which i mean to insert along with this and give up to your or ep clarks keeping for as you will see i have appointed clark my representative economic plenipotentiary and factotum if he will consent to act in that sublime capacity subject always to your advice to your control in all ultra economic respects of which you alone are cognizant of the circumstances or competent to give a judgment pray explain this with all lucidity to mr clark and endeavor to impress upon him that it is to all appearance a real affair of business we are now engaged in that i would have him satisfy his own sharp eyes by such methods as he finds convenient and sufficient by examination at new york or how he can that the conditions of this bargain are fairly complied with by the new york booksellers who promise every facility for ascertaining how many copies are printed c c and profess to be of the integrity of israelites indeed in all respects whatever if so it may be really useful to us and i would have mr clark if he will allow me to look upon him as my man of business in this affair take reasonable pains be at any reasonable expense c by himself or by deputy to ascertain that it is so in very fact in that case if something come of it we shall get the something and be thankful if nothing come of it we shall have the pleasure of caring nothing about it i have given putnam two books heroes and sartor ready corrected the others i think will follow in the course of next month f revolution waits only for an index which my man is now busy with the cromwell supplement and all he has now got published two days ago after sorrowful delays your copy will be ready this afternoon too late i fear by just one day it will lie in that case for a fortnight and then come wiley will find that he has no resource but to reprint the book he will reprint the supplement too in justice to former purchasers but this is the final form of the book this second edition and to this all readers of it will come at last we expect the daguerreotype by next steamer but you take good care not to prepossess us on its behalf in fact i believe the only satisfactory course will be to get a sketch done too if you have any painter that can manage it tolerably pray set about that as the true solution of the business out of the two together we shall make a likeness for ourselves that will do let the lady wife be satisfied with it then we shall pronounce it genuine i envy you your forestwork your summer umbrages and clear silent lakes the weather here is getting insupportable to us for heat indeed if rain do not come within two weeks i believe we must wind up our affairs and make for some shady place direct scotland is perhaps likeliest but nothing yet is fixed you shall duly hear directly after this i set off for putnams in waterloo place sign his paper there stick one copy under a cover for you and despatch send me word about all that you are doing and thinking be busy be still and happy yours ever t carlyle cxiii emerson to carlyle concord july my dear carlyle i received by the last steamer your letter with the copy of the covenant with wiley and putnam which seems unexceptionable i like the english side of those men very well that is putnam seems eager to stand well and rightly with his fellowmen wiley at new york it was who provoked me last winter to write him an angry letter when he declared his intention to reprint our new matter without paying for it when he thought better of it and came to terms i had not got so far as to be affectionate and have never yet resumed the correspondence i had with him a year ago about my own books i hope you found my letter to them though i do not remember which properly cross i believe i only enumerated difficulties i have talked with little and brown about their editions of chartism and past and present they have made no new sales of the books since they were printed on by the pirates and say that the books lie still on their shelves as also do a few copies of the london and boston edition of french revolution i prayed them immediately to dispose of these things by auction or at their trade sales at whatever prices would sell them and leave the market open for w p which they promise to do to munroe i went and learn that he has bought the stereotype plates of the new york pirate edition of sartor and means to print it immediately he is willing to stop if w p will buy of him his plates at their cost i wrote so to them but they say no and i have not spoken again with munroe i was in town yesterday and carried the copy of the covenant to ep clark and read him your message his bank occupies him entirely just now for his president is gone to europe and clarks duties are the more onerous but finding that the new responsibilities delegated to him are light and tolerable and at any rate involve no retrospection he very cheerfully signified his readiness to serve you and i graciously forbore all allusions to my heap of booksellers accounts which he has had in keeping now for years i believe he told me that he hopes at no distant day to have a house of his own he and his wife are always at board and whenever that happens he intends to devote a chamber in it to his illustrations of mr carlyles writings which i believe i have told you before are a very large and extraordinary collection of prints pictures books and manuscripts i sent you the promised daguerrotype with all unwillingness by the steamer i think of june on august margaret fuller goes to england and the continent and i shall not fail to write to you by her and you must not fail to give a good and faithful interview to this wise sincere accomplished and most entertaining of women i wish to bespeak jane carlyles friendliest ear to one of the noblest of women we shall send you no other such i was lately inquired of again by an agent of a huge boston society of young men whether mr carlyle would not come to america and read lectures on some terms which they could propose i advised them to make him an offer and a better one than they had in view joy and peace to you in your new freedom rwe cxiv carlyle to emerson chelsea july dear emerson since i wrote last to you i think with the wileyandputnam covenant enclosed the photograph after some days of loitering at the liverpool customhouse came safe to hand many thanks to you for this punctuality this poor shadow it is all you could do at present in that matter but it must not rest there no this image is altogether unsatisfactory illusive and even in some measure tragical to me first of all it is a bad photograph no eyes discernible at least one of the eyes not except in rare favorable lights then alas time itself and oblivion must have been busy i could not at first nor can i yet with perfect decisiveness bring out any feature completely recalling to me the old emerson that lighted on us from the blue at craigenputtock long ago eheu here is a genial smiling energetic face full of sunny strength intelligence integrity good humor but it lies imprisoned in baleful shades as of the valley of death seems smiling on me as if in mockery dost know me friend i am dead thou seest and distant and forever hidden from thee i belong already to the eternities and thou recognizest me not on the whole it is the strangest feeling i have and practically the thing will be that you get us by the earliest opportunity some living pictorial sketch chalk drawing or the like from a trustworthy hand and send it hither to represent you out of the two i shall compile for myself a likeness by degrees but as for this present we cannot put up with it at all to my wife and me and to sundry other parties far and near that have interest in it there is no satisfaction in this so there will be nothing for you but compliance by the first fair chance you have furthermore i bargain that the lady emerson have within reasonable limits a royal veto in the business not absolute if that threaten extinction to the enterprise but absolute within the limits of possibility and that she take our case in hand and graciously consider what can and shall be done that will answer i think of late weeks i have been either idle or sunk in the sorrowfulest cobbling of old shoes again sorrowfully reading over old books for the putnams and chapmans namely it is really painful looking in ones own old face said old face no longer a thing extant now happily i have at last finished it the whole lumbertroop with clothes duly brushed french revolution has even got an index too travels to new york in the steamer that brings you this quod faustum sit or indeed i do not much care whether it be faustum or not i grow to care about an astonishingly small number of things as times turn with me man all men seem radically dumb jabbering mere jargons and noises from the teeth outwards the inner meaning of them of them and of me poor devils remaining shut buried forever if almost all books were burnt my own laid next the coal i sometimes in my spleen feel as if it really would be better with us certainly could one generation of men be forced to live without rhetoric babblement hearsay in short with the tongue well cut out of them altogether their fortunate successors would find a most improved world to start upon for cant does lie piled on us high as the zenith an augean stable with the poisonous confusion piled so high which simply if there once could be nothing said would mostly dwindle like summer snow gradually about its business and leave us free to use our eyes again when i see painful professors of greek poring in their sumptuous oxfords over dead greek for a thousand years or more and leaving live english all the while to develop itself under charge of pickwicks and sam wellers as if it were nothing and the other were all things this and the like of it everywhere fills me with reflections good heavens will the people not come out of their wretched oldclothes monmouthstreets hebrew and other but lie there dying of the basest pestilence dying and as good as dead on the whole i am very weary of most literature and indeed in very sorrowful abstruse humor otherwise at present for remedy to which i am in these very hours preparing for a sally into the green country and deep silence i know not altogether how or whitherward as yet only that i must tend towards lancashire towards scotland at last my wife already waits me in lancashire went off in rather poor case much burnt by the hot town some ten days ago and does not yet report much improvement i will write to you somewhere in my wanderings the address scotsbrig ecclefechan nb if you chance to write directly or soon after this arrives will likely be the shortest at any rate that or cheyne row either is always sure enough to find me in a day or two after trying by a kind of accident i have fallen considerably into american history in these days and am even looking out for american geography to help me jared sparks marshall c are hickory and buckskin but i do catch a credible trait of human life from them here and there michelets genial champagne froth alas i could find no fact in it that would stand handling and so have broken down in the middle of la france and run over to hickory and jared for shelter do you know beriah green a body of albany newspapers represent to me the people quarreling in my name in a very vague manner as to the propriety of being governed and beriahs is the only rational voice among them farewell dear friend speedy news of you t carlyle the reverend beriah green president for some years of oneida institute a manuallabor school at whitesboro ny he was an active reformer and a leading member of the national convention which met in philadelphia december th to form the american antislavery society he died in seventynine years old cxv emerson to carlyle concord july my dear friend the new edition of cromwell in its perfect form and in excellent dress and the copy of the appendix came munificently safe by the last steamer when thought is best then is there most is a faith of which you alone among writing men at this day will give me experience if it is the right frankincense and sandalwood it is so good and heavenly to give me a basketful and not a pinch i read proudly a little at a time and have not yet got through the new matter but i think neither the new letters nor the commentary could be spared wiley and putnam shall do what they can and we will see if new england will not come to reckon this the best chapter in her pentateuch i send this letter by margaret fuller of whose approach i believe i wrote you some word there is no foretelling how you visited and crowded english will like our few educated men or women and in your learned populace my luminaries may easily be overlooked but of all the travelers whom you have so kindly received from me i think of none since alcott went to england whom i so much desired that you should see and like as this dear old friend of mine for two years now i have scarcely seen her as she has been at new york engaged by horace greeley as a literary editor of his tribune newspaper this employment was made acceptable to her by good pay great local and personal conveniences of all kinds and unbounded confidence and respect from greeley himself and all other parties connected with this influential journal of subscribers i believe and margaret fullers work as critic of all new books critic of the drama of music and good arts in new york has been honorable to her still this employment is not satisfactory to me she is full of all nobleness and with the generosity native to her mind and character appears to me an exotic in new england a foreigner from some more sultry and expansive climate she is i suppose the earliest reader and lover of goethe in this country and nobody here knows him so well her love too of whatever is good in french and specially in italian genius give her the best title to travel in short she is our citizen of the world by quite special diploma and i am heartily glad that she has an opportunity of going abroad that pleases her mr spring a merchant of great moral merits and as i am informed an assiduous reader of your books has grown rich and resolves to see the world with his wife and son and has wisely invited miss fuller to show it to him now in the first place i wish you to see margaret when you are in special good humor and have an hour of boundless leisure and i entreat jane carlyle to abet and exalt and secure this satisfaction to me i need not and yet perhaps i need say that mf is the safest of all possible persons who ever took pen in hand prince metternichs closet not closer or half so honorable in the next place i should be glad if you can easily manage to show her the faces of tennyson and of browning she has a sort of right to them both not only because she likes their poetry but because she has made their merits widely known among our young people and be it known to my friend jane carlyle whom if i cannot see i delight to name that her visitor is an immense favorite in the parlor as well as in the library in all good houses where she is known and so i commend her to you yours affectionately rw emerson cxvi carlyle to emerson chelsea december dear emerson this is the th of the month and it is a frightful length of time i know not how long since i wrote to you sinner that i am truly we are in no case for paying debts at present being all sick more or less from the hard cold weather and in a state of great temporary puddle but as the adage says one should own debt and crave days therefore accept a word from me such as it may be i went as usual to the north country in the autumn passed some two extremely disconsolate months for all things distress a wretched thinskinned creature like me in that old region which is at once an earth and a hades to me an unutterable place now that i have become mostly a ghost there i saw ireland too on my return saw black potatofields a ragged noisy population that has long in a headlong baleful manner followed the devils leading listened namely to blustering shallow violent impostors and children of darkness saying yes we know you you are children of light and so has fallen all out at elbows in body and in soul and now having lost its potatoes is come as it were to a crisis all its windy nonsense cracking suddenly to pieces under its feet a very pregnant crisis indeed a country cast suddenly into the meltingpot say into the medeascaldron to be boiled into horrid dissolution whether into new youth into sound healthy life or into eternal death and annihilation one does not yet know daniel oconnell stood bodily before me in his green mullaghmart cap haranguing his retinue of dupables certainly the most sordid humbug i have ever seen in this world the emblem to me he and his talk and the worship and credence it found of all the miseries that can befall a nation i also conversed with young ireland in a confidential manner for young ireland really meaning what it says is worth a little talk the heroism and patriotism of a new generation welling fresh and new from the breasts of nature and already poisoned by oconnellism and the old irish atmosphere of bluster falsity fatuity into one knows not what very sad to see on the whole no man ought for any cause to speak lies or have anything to do with lies but either hold his tongue or speak a bit of the truth that is the meaning of a tongue people used to know ireland was not the place to console my sorrows i returned home very sad out of ireland and indeed have remained one of the saddest idlest most useless of adams sons ever since and do still remain so i care not to write anything more so it seems to me at present i am in my vacant interlunar cave i suppose that is the truth and i ought to wrap my mantle round me and lie if dark silent also but alas i have wasted almost all your poor sheet first miss fuller came duly as you announced was welcomed for your sake and her own a highsoaring clear enthusiast soul in whose speech there is much of all that one wants to find in speech a sharp subtle intellect too and less of that shoreless asiatic dreaminess than i have sometimes met with in her writings we liked one another very well i think and the springs too were favorites but on the whole it could not be concealed least of all from the sharp female intellect that this carlyle was a dreadfully heterodox not to say a dreadfully savage fellow at heart believing no syllable of all that gospel of fraternity benevolence and new heavenonearth preached forth by all manner of advanced creatures from george sand to elihu burritt in these days that in fact the said carlyle not only disbelieved all that but treated it as poisonous cant sweetness of sugaroflead a detestable phosphorescence from the dead body of a christianity that would not admit itself to be dead and lie buried with all its unspeakable putrescences as a venerable dead one ought surely detestable enough to all which margaret listened with much good nature though of course with sad reflections not a few she is coming back to us she promises her dialect is very vernacular extremely exotic in the london climate if she do not gravitate too irresistibly towards that class of newera people which includes whatsoever we have of prurient esurient morbid flimsy and in fact pitiable and unprofitable and is at a sad discount among men of sense she may get into good tracks of inquiry and connection here and be very useful to herself and others i could not show her alfred he has been here since nor landor but surely if i can i will that or a hundred times as much as that when she returns they tell me you are about collecting your poems well though i do not approve of rhyme at all yet it is impossible emerson in rhyme or prose can put down any thought that was in his heart but i should wish to get into mine so let me have the book as fast as may be and do others like it if you will take circumbendibuses for sounds sake and excuse the critic who seems to you so unmusical and say it is the nature of beast adieu dear friend write to me write to me yours ever t carlyle miss fullers impressions of carlyle much to this effect may be found in the memoirs of margaret fuller ossoli boston vol ii pp cxvii emerson to carlyle concord january my dear carlyle your letter came with a blessing last week i had already learned from margaret fuller at paris that you had been very good and gentle to her brilliant and prevailing of course but i inferred had actually restrained the volleys and modulated the thunder out of true courtesy and goodness of nature which was worthy of all praise in a spoiled conqueror at this time of day especially too she expressed a true recognition and love of jane carlyle and thus her visit proved a solid satisfaction to me also who think that few people have so well earned their pleasures as she she wrote me a long letter she has been very happy in england and her time and strength fully employed her description of you and your discourse which i read with lively curiosity also was the best i have had on that subject i tried hard to write you by the december steamer to tell you how forward was my book of poems but a little affair makes me much writing i chanced to have three or four items of business to despatch when the steamer was ready to go and you escaped hearing of them i am the trustee of charles lane who came out here with alcott and bought land which though sold is not paid for somebody or somebodies in liverpool and manchester have proposed once or twice with more or less specification that i should come to those cities to lecture and who knows but i may come one day steam is strong and liverpool is near i should find my account in the strong inducement of a new audience to finish pieces which have lain waiting with little hope for months or years mr alexander ireland who had made the acquaintance of emerson at edinburgh in was his manchester correspondent his memorial volume on emerson contains an interesting record of their relations ah then if i dared i should be well content to add some golden hours to my life in seeing you now all fullgrown and acknowledged amidst your own people to hear and to speak is so little yet so much but life is dangerous and delicate i should like to see your solid england the map of britain is good reading for me then i have a very ignorant love of pictures and a curiosity about the greek statues and stumps in the british museum so beware of me for on that distant day when i get ready i shall come long before this time you ought to have received from john chapman a copy of emersons poems so called which he was directed to send you poor man you need not open them i know all you can say i printed them not because i was deceived into a belief that they were poems but because of the softness or hardness of heart of many friends here who have made it a point to have them circulated once having set out to print i obeyed the solicitations of john chapman of an illomened street in london to send him the book in manuscript for the better securing of copyright in printing them here i have corrected the most unpardonable negligences which negligences must be all stereotyped under his fair london covers and gilt paper to the eyes of any curious london reader from which recollection i strive to turn away in the rough draft the following sentence comes in here i reckon myself a good beginning of a poet very urgent and decided in my bent and in some coming millennium i shall yet sing little and brown have just rendered me an account by which it appears that we are not quite so well off as was thought last summer when they said they had sold at auction the balance of your books which had been lying unsold it seems now that the books supposed to be sold were not all taken and are returned to them one hundred chartism sixtythree past and present yet we are to have some eightythree dollars which you shall probably have by the next steamer yours affectionately rw emerson cxviii carlyle to emerson chelsea london march dear emerson the steamer goes tomorrow i must though in a very dim condition have a little word for you conveyed by it in the miscellaneous maw of that strange steamer shall lie among other things a friendly word your very kind letter lay waiting me here some ten days ago doubly welcome after so long a silence we had been in hampshire with the barings where we were last year some four weeks or more totally idle our winter had been and indeed still is unusually severe my wifes health in consequence was sadly deranged but this idleness these isleofwight sea breezes have brought matters well round again so we cannot grudge the visit or the idleness which otherwise too might have its uses alas at this time my normal state is to be altogether idle to look out upon a very lonely universe full of grim sorrow full of splendor too and not to know at all for the moment on what side i am to attack it again i read your book of poems all faithfully at bay house our hampshire quarters where the obstinate people with whom you are otherwise in prose a first favorite foolishly refused to let me read aloud foolishly for i would have made it mostly all plain by commentary so i had to read for myself and can say in spite of my hardheartedness i did gain though under impediments a real satisfaction and some tone of the eternal melodies sounding afar off ever and anon in my ear this is fact a truth in natural history from which you are welcome to draw inferences a grand view of the universe everywhere the sound unhappily far of as it were of a valiant genuine human soul this even under rhyme is a satisfaction worth some struggling for but indeed you are very perverse and through this perplexed undiaphanous element you do not fall on me like radiant summer rainbows like floods of sunlight but with thin piercing radiances which affect me like the light of the stars it is so i wish you would become concrete and write in prose the straightest way but under any form i must put up with you that is my lot chapmans edition as you probably know is very beautiful i believe there are enough of ardent silent seekers in england to buy up this edition from him and resolutely study the same as for the review multitude they dare not exactly call it unintelligible moonshine and so will probably hold their tongue it is my fixed opinion that we are all at sea as to what is called poetry art c in these times laboring under a dreadful incubus of tradition and mere cant heaped balefully on us up to the very zenith as men in nearly all other provinces of their life except perhaps the railway province do now labor and stagger in a word that goetheand schillers kunst has far more brotherhood with puseyand newmans shovelhattery and other the like deplorable phenomena than it is in the least aware of i beg you take warning i am more serious in this than you suppose but no you will not you whistle lightly over my prophecies and go your own stiffnecked road unfortunate man i had read in the newspapers and even heard in speech from manchester people that you were certainly coming this very summer to lecture among us but now it seems in your letter all postponed into the vague again i do not personally know your manchester negotiators but i know in general that they are men of respectability insight and activity much connected with the lecturing department which is a very growing one especially in lancashire at present men likely for the rest to fulfil whatsoever they may become engaged for to you my own ignorant though confident guess moreover is that you would in all senses of the word succeed there i think also rather confidently we could promise you an audience of british aristocracy in london here and of british commonalty all manner of audiences that you liked to stoop to i heard an ignorant blockhead or mainly so called bowwowing here some months ago to an audience of several thousands in the city one evening upon universal peace or some other field of balderdash which the poor people seemed very patient of in a word i do not see what is to hinder you to come whenever you can resolve upon it the adventure is perfectly promising an adventure familiar to you withal for lecturing is with us fundamentally just what it is with you much prurient curiosity with some ingenuous love of wisdom an element of real reverence for the same everywhere a perfect openness to any man speaking in any measure things manful come therefore gird yourself together and come with little or no peradventure you will realize what your modest hope is and more and i for my share of it shall see you once again under this sun o heavens there might be some good in that nay if you will travel like a private quiet person who knows but i the most unlocomotive of mortals might be able to escort you up and down a little to look at many a thing along with you and even to open my long closed heart and speak about the same there is a spareroom always in this house for you in this heart in these two hearts the like bid me hope in this enterprise in all manner of ways where i can and on the whole get it rightly put together and embark on it and arrive the good miss fuller has painted us all en beau and your smiling imagination has added new colors we have not a triumphant life here very far indeed from that ach gott as you shall see but margaret is an excellent soul in real regard with both of us here since she went i have been reading some of her papers in a new book we have got greatly superior to all i knew before in fact the undeniable utterances now first undeniable to me of a true heroic mind altogether unique so far as i know among the writing women of this generation rare enough too god knows among the writing men she is very narrow sometimes but she is truly high honor to margaret and more and more goodspeed to her adieu dear emerson i am ever yours tc cxix carlyle to emerson chelsea march dear emerson yesterday morning setting out to breakfast with richard milnes milness breakfast is a thing you will yet have to experience i met by the sunny shore of the thames a benevolent son of adam in blue coat and red collar who thrust into my hand a letter from you a truly miraculous son of adam in red collar in the sunny spring morning the bill of seventeen pounds is already far on its way to dumfries there to be kneaded into gold by the due artists today is american post day and already in huge hurry about many things i am scribbling you some word of answer the night before milness morning i had furthermore seen your manchester correspondent ireland an old edinborough acquaintance too as i found a solid dark broad rather heavy man full of energy and broad sagacity and practicality infinitely well affected to the man emerson too it was our clear opinion that you might come at any time with ample assurance of succeeding so far as wages went and otherwise that you ought to come and must and would as he ireland would farther write to you there is only one thing i have to add of my own and beg you to bear in mind a date merely videlicet that the time for lecturing to the london westend i was given everywhere to understand is from the latter end of april or say april altogether to the end of may this is a fixed statistic fact all men told me of this you are in all arrangements to keep mind for it will actually do your heart good to look into the faces and speak into minds of really aristocratic persons being one yourself you sinner and perhaps indeed this will be the greatest of all the novelties that await you in your voyage not to be seen i believe at least never seen by me in any perfection except in london only from april to the end of may during those weeks you must be here and free remember that date will you come in winter then next winter or when ireland professed to know you by the photograph too which i never yet can i wrote by last packet enough here your friend cunningham has not presented himself shall be right welcome when he does as all that in the least belong to you may well hope to be adieu our love to you all ever yours t carlyle cxx emerson to carlyle concord april my dear carlyle i have two good letters from you and until now you have had no acknowledgment especially i ought to have told you how much pleasure your noble invitation in march gave me this pleasing dream of going to england dances before me sometimes it would be i then fancy that stimulation which my capricious languid and languescent study needs at home no man makes any proper demand on me and the audience i address is a handful of men and women too widely scattered than that they can dictate to me that which they are justly entitled to say whether supercilious or respectful they do not say anything that can be heard of course i have only myself to please and my work is slighted as soon as it has lost its first attraction it is to be hoped if one should cross the sea that the terror of your english culture would scare the most desultory of yankees into precision and fidelity and perhaps i am not yet too old to be animated by what would have seemed to my youth a proud privilege if you shall fright me into labor and concentration i shall win my game for i can well afford to pay any price to get my work well done for the rest i hesitate of course to rush rudely on persons that have been so long invisible angels to me no reasonable man but must hold these bounds in awe i much more who am of a solitary habit from my childhood until now i hear nothing again from mr ireland so i will let the english voyage hang as an afternoon rainbow in the east and mind my apples and pears for the present you are to know that in these days i lay out a patch of orchard near my house very much to the improvement as all the household affirm of our homestead though i have little skill in these things and must borrow that of my neighbors yet the works of the garden and orchard at this season are fascinating and will eat up days and weeks and a brave scholar should shun it like gambling and take refuge in cities and hotels from these pernicious enchantments for the present i stay in the new orchard duyckinck a literary man in new york who advises wiley and putnam in their publishing enterprises wrote me lately that they had for you from cromwell so may it be yours rwe cxxi carlyle to emerson chelsea may dear emerson my time is nearly up today but i write a word to acknowledge your last letter april and various other things for example you must tell mr thoreau is that the exact name for i have lent away the printed pages that his philadelphia magazine with the lecture in two pieces was faithfully delivered here about a fortnight ago and carefully read as beseemed with due entertainment and recognition a vigorous mr thoreau who has formed himself a good deal upon one emerson but does not want abundant fire and stamina of his own recognizes us and various other things in a most admiring greathearted manner for which as for part of the confused voice from the jury bog not yet summed into a verdict nor likely to be summed till doomsday nor needful to sum the poor prisoner at the bar may justly express himself thankful in plain prose i like mr thoreau very well and hope yet to hear good and better news of him only let him not turn to foolishness which seems to me to be terribly easy at present both in new england and old may the lord deliver us all from cant may the lord whatever else he do or forbear teach us to look facts honestly in the face and to beware with a kind of shudder of smearing them over with our despicable and damnable palaver into irrecognizability and so falsifying the lords own gospels to his unhappy blockheads of children all staggering down to gehenna and the everlasting swinestrough for want of gospels o heaven it is the most accursed sin of man and done everywhere at present on the streets and high places at noonday very seriously i say and pray as my chief orison may the lord deliver us from it on carlyle published in grahams magazine in march and april about a week ago there came your neighbor hoar a solid sensible effectuallooking man of whom i hope to see much more so soon as possible i got him under way for oxford where i suppose he was last week both universities was too much for the limits of his time so he preferred oxford and now this very day i think he was to set out for the continent not to return till the beginning of july when he promises to call here again there was something really pleasant to me in this mr hoar and i had innumerable things to ask him about concord concerning which topic we had hardly got a word said when our first interview had to end i sincerely hope he will not fail to keep his time in returning you do very well my friend to plant orchards and fair fruit shall they grow if it please heaven for your grandchildren to pluck a beautiful occupation for the son of man in all patriarchal and paternal times which latter are patriarchal too but you are to understand withal that your coming hither to lecture is taken as a settled point by all your friends here and for my share i do not reckon upon the smallest doubt about the essential fact of it simply on some calculation and adjustment about the circumstantials of ireland who i surmise is busy in the problem even now you will hear by and by probably in more definite terms i did not see him again after my first notice of him to you but there is no doubt concerning his determinations for all manner of reasons to get you to lancashire to england and in fact it is an adventure which i think you ought to contemplate as fixed say for this year and the beginning of next ireland will help you to fix the dates and there is nothing else i think which should need fixing unquestionably you would get an immense quantity of food for ideas though perhaps not at all in the way you anticipate in looking about among us nay if you even thought us stupid there is something in the godlike indifference with which london will accept and sanction even that verdict something highly instructive at least and in short for the truth must be told london is properly your mother city too verily you have about as much to do with it in spite of polk and q victory as i had and you ought to come and look at it beyond doubt and say to this land old mother how are you getting on at all to which the mother will answer thankee young son and you in a way useful to both parties that is truth adieu dear emerson good be with you always hoar gave me your american poems thanks vale et me ama t carlyle cxxii emerson to carlyle concord june dear carlyle i have just got your friendliest letter of may with its varied news and new invitations really you are a dangerous correspondent with your solid and urgent ways of speaking no affairs and no studies of mine i fear will be able to make any head against these bribes well i will adorn the brow of the coming months with this fine hope then if the rich god at last refuses the jewel no doubt he will give something better to both of us but thinking on this project lately i see one thing plainly that i must not come to london as a lecturer if the plan proceed i will come and see you thankful to heaven for that mercy should such a romance looking reality come to pass i will come and see you and jane carlyle and will hear what you have to say you shall even show me if you will such other men and women as will suffer themselves to be seen and heard asking for nothing again then i will depart in peace as i came at mr irelands institutes i will read lectures and possibly in london too if when there you looking with your clear eyes shall say that it is desired by persons who ought to be gratified but i wish such lecturing to be a mere contingency and nowise a settled purpose i had rather stay at home and forego the happiness of seeing you and the excitement of england than to have the smallest pains taken to collect an audience for me so now we will leave this egg in the desert for the ostrich time to hatch it or not it seems you are not tired of pale americans or will not own it you have sent our countrysenator where he wanted to go and to the best hospitalities as we learn today directly from him i cannot avoid sending you another of a different stamp henry hedge is a recluse but catholic scholar in our remote bangor who reads german and smokes in his solitary study through nearly eight months of snow in the year and deals out every sunday his witty apothegms to the lumbermerchants and townshipowners of penobscot river who have actually grown intelligent interpreters of his riddles by long hearkening after them they have shown themselves very loving and generous lately in making a quite munificent provision for his traveling hedge has a true and mellow heart and i hope you will like him the hon e rockwood hoar i have seen lately a texan ardent and vigorous who assured me that carlyles writings were read with eagerness on the banks of the colorado there was more to tell but it is too late ever yours rw emerson cxxiii emerson to carlyle concord july dear carlyle in my old age i am coming to see you i have written this day in answer to sundry letters brought me by the last steamer from mr ireland and mr hudson of leeds that i mean in good earnest to sail for liverpool or for london about the first of october and i am disposing my astonished household astonished at such a somerset of the sedentary master with that view my brother william was here this week from new york and will come again to carry my mother home with him for the winter my wife and children three are combining for and against me at all events i am to have my visit i pray you to cherish your good nature your mercy let your wife cherish it that i may see i indolent this incredible worker whose toil has been long since my pride and wonder that i may see him benign and unexacting he shall not be at the crisis of some overlabor i shall not stay but an hour what do i care for his fame ah how gladly i hoped once to see sterling as mediator and amalgam when my turn should come to see the saxon gods at home sterling who had certain american qualities in his genius and now you send me his shade i found at munroes shop the effigy which he said cunningham whom i have not seen or heard from had left there for me a front face and a profile both especially the first a very welcome satisfaction to my sad curiosity the face very national certainly but how thoughtful and how friendly what more belongs to this print whether you are editing his books or yourself drawing his lineaments i know not i find my friends have laid out much work for me in yorkshire and lancashire what part of it i shall do i cannot yet tell as soon as i know how to arrange my journey best i shall write you again yours affectionately rw emerson cxxiv carlyle to emerson rawdon near leeds yorkshire august dear emerson almost ever since your last letter reached me i have been wandering over the country enveloped either in a restless whirl of locomotives viewhunting c or sunk in the deepest torpor of total idleness and laziness forgetting and striving to forget that there was any world but that of dreams and though at intervals the reproachful remembrance has arisen sharply enough on me that i ought on all accounts high and low to have written you an answer never till today have i been able to take pen in hand and actually begin that operation such is the naked fact my wife is with me we leave no household behind us but a servant the face of england with its mad electioneerings vacant tourist dilettantings with its shady woods green yellow harvestfields and dingy millchimneys so new and old so beautiful and ugly every way so abstruse and unspeakable invites to silence the whole world fruitful yet disgusting to this human soul of mine invites me to silence to sleep and dreams and stagnant indifference as if for the time one had got into the country of the lotoseaters and it made no matter what became of anything and all things in good truth it is a wearied man at least a dreadfully slothful and slumberous man eager for sleep in any quantity that now addresses you be thankful for a few halfdreaming words till we awake again as to your visit to us there is but one thing to be said and repeated that a prophets chamber is ready for you in chelsea and a brotherly and sisterly welcome on whatever day at whatever hour you arrive this which is all of the practical that i can properly take charge of is to be considered a given quantity always with regard to lecturing c ireland with whom i suppose you to be in correspondence seems to have awakened all this north country into the fixed hope of hearing you and god knows they have need enough to hear a man with sense in his head it was but the other day i read in one of their newspapers we understand that mr emerson the distinguished c is certainly c this winter all in due newspaper phrase and i think they settled your arrival for october next may it prove so but on the whole there is no doubt of your coming that is a great fact and if so i should say why not come at once even as the editor surmises you will evidently do no other considerable enterprise till this voyage to england is achieved come therefore and we shall see we shall hear and speak i do not know another man in all the world to whom i can speak with clear hope of getting adequate response from him if i speak to you it will be a breaking of my silence for the last time perhaps perhaps for the first time on some points allons i shall not always be so roadweary lifeweary sleepy and stony as at present i even think there is yet another book in me exodus from houndsditch i think it might be called a peeling off of fetid jewhood in every sense from myself and my poor bewildered brethren one other book and if it were a right one rest after that the deeper the better forevermore ach gott hedge is one of the sturdiest little fellows i have come across for many a day a face like a rock a voice like a howitzer only his honest kind gray eyes reassure you a little we have met only once but hope mutually i flatter myself it may be often by and by that hardy little fellow too what has he to do with semitic tradition and the dusthole of extinct socinianism georgesandism and the twaddle of a thousand magazines thor and his hammer even seem to me a little more respectable at least my dear sir endeavor to clear your mind of cant oh we are all sunk much deeper than any of us imagines and our worship of beautiful sentiments c c is as contemptible a form of longears as any other perhaps the most so of any it is in fact damnable we will say no more of it at present hedge came to me with tall lank chapman at his side an innocent flail of a creature with considerable impetus in him the two when they stood up together looked like a circle and tangent in more senses than one jacobson the oxford doctor who welcomed your concord senator in that city writes to me that he has received with blushes c some grand gift for his child from that traveler whom i am accordingly to thank and blush to jacobson not knowing his address at present the address of course is still more unknown to me at present but we shall know it and the man it indicates i hope again before long so much for that and now dear emerson adieu will your next letter tell us the when o my friend we are here with quakers or exquakers rather a very curious people like water from the crystal well in a very curious country too most beautiful and very ugly but why write of it or of anything more while half asleep and lotoseating adieu my friend come soon and let us meet again under this sun yours t carlyle cxxv emerson to carlyle concord september my dear carlyle the last steamer brought as ever good tidings from you though certainly from a new habitat at leeds or near it if leeds will only keep you a little in its precinct i will search for you there for it is one of the parishes in the diocese which mr ireland and his friends have carved out for me on the map of england i have taken a berth in the packetship washington irving which leaves boston for liverpool next week october having decided after a little demurring and advising to follow my inclination in shunning the steamer the owners will almost take oath that their ship cannot be out of a port twenty days at liverpool and manchester i shall take advice of ireland and his officers of the institutes and perhaps shall remain for some time in that region if my courage and my head are equal to the work they offer me i will write you what befalls me in the strange city who knows but i may have adventures i who had never one as i have just had occasion to write to mrs howitt who inquired what mine were well if i survive liverpool and manchester and leeds or rather my errands thither i shall come some fine day to see you in your burly city you in the centre of the world and sun me a little in your british heart it seems a lively passage that i am entering in the old dream world and perhaps the slumbers are lighter and the morning is near softly dear shadows do not scatter yet knit your panorama close and well till these rare figures just before me draw near and are greeted and known but there is no more time in this late night and what need since i shall see you and yours soon ever yours rwe cxxvi carlyle to emerson chelsea october my dear emerson your letter from concord of the st of july had arrived duly in london been duly forwarded to my transient address at buxton in derbyshire and there by the faithless postmaster retained among his lumber instead of given to me when i called on him we staid in buxton only one day and night two newspapers as i recollect the postmaster did deliver to me on my demand but your letter he with scandalous carelessness kept back and left me to travel forwards without there accordingly it lay week after week for a month or more and only by halfaccident and the extraordinary diligence and accuracy of our chelsea postman was it recovered at all not many days ago after my wifes return hither consider what kind of fact this was and has been for us for now if all have gone right you are approaching the coast of england chelsea and your fraternal house hidden under a disastrous cloud to you and i know not so much as whitherward to write and send you a word of solution it is one of the most unpleasant mistakes that ever befell me i have no resource but to enclose this note to mr ireland and charge him by the strongest adjurations to have it ready for you the first thing when you set foot upon our shores mr ireland in his recollections of emersons visit to england p prints carlyles note to himself enclosing this letter and adds the ship reached liverpool on the d of october and mr emerson at once proceeded to manchester after spending a few hours in friendly talk he was shot up as carlyle had desired to chelsea and at the end of a week returned to manchester to begin his lectures know then my friend that in verity your home while in england is here and all other places whither work or amusement may call you are but inns and temporary lodgings i have returned hither a day or two ago and free from any urgent calls or businesses of any kind my wife has your room all ready and here surely if anywhere in the wide earth there ought to be a brothers welcome and kind home waiting you yes by allah an express train leaves liverpool every afternoon and in some six hours will set you down here i know not what your engagements are but i say to myself why not come at once and rest a little from your seachanges before going farther in six hours you can be out of the unstable waters and sitting in your own room here you shall not be bothered with talk till you repose and you shall have plenty of it hot and hot when the appetite does arise in you no great cheyne row chelsea come to the london terminus from any side say these magic words to any cabman and by night or by day you are a welcome apparition here foul befall us otherwise this is the fact what more can i say i make my affidavit of the same and require you in the name of all lares and penates and household gods ancient and modern which are sacred to men to consider it and take brotherly account of it shall we hear of you then in a day or two shall we not perhaps see you in a day or two that depends on the winds and the chances but our affection is independent of such adieu au revoir it now is come soon come at once ever yours t carlyle extracts from emersons diary october i found at liverpool after a couple of days a letter which had been seeking me from carlyle addressed to rwe on the instant when he lands in england conveying the heartiest welcome and urgent invitation to house and hearth and finding that i should not be wanted for a week in the lecturerooms i came down to london on monday and at ten at night the door was opened by jane carlyle and the man himself was behind her with a lamp in the hall they were very little changed from their old selves of fourteen years ago in august when i left them at craigenputtock well said carlyle here we are shoveled together again the floodgates of his talk are quickly opened and the river is a plentiful stream we had a wide talk that night until nearly one oclock and at breakfast next morning again at noon or later we walked forth to hyde park and the palaces about two miles from here to the national gallery and to the strand carlyle melting all westminster and london into his talk and laughter as he goes here in his house we breakfast about nine and carlyle is very prone his wife says to sleep till ten or eleven if he has no company an immense talker and altogether as extraordinary in that as in his writing i think even more so you will never discover his real vigor and range or how much more he might do than he has ever done without seeing him my few hours discourse with him long ago in scotland gave me not enough knowledge of him and i have now at last been taken by surprise by him c and his wife live on beautiful terms their ways are very engaging and in her bookcase all his books are inscribed to her as they came from year to year each with some significant lines i had a good talk with c last night he says over and over for months for years the same thing yet his guiding genius is his moral sense his perception of the sole importance of truth and justice and he too says that there is properly no religion in england he is quite contemptuous about kunst also in germans or english or americans and has a huge respect for the duke of wellington as the only englishman or the only one in the aristocracy who will have nothing to do with any manner of lie see english traits ch xvi and life of sterling part ii ch vii among the windy gospels addressed to our poor century there are few louder than this of art the following sentences are of later date than the preceding carlyle had all the kleinstadtlich traits of an islander and a scotsman and reprimanded with severity the rebellious instincts of the native of a vast continent which made light of the british islands carlyle has a hairy strength which makes his literary vocation a mere chance and what seems very contemptible to him i could think only of an enormous triphammer with an aeolian attachment in carlyle as in byron one is more struck with the rhetoric than with the matter he has manly superiority rather than intellectuality and so makes good hard hits all the time there is more character than intellect in every sentence herein strongly resembling samuel johnson england makes what a step from dr johnson to carlyle what wealth of thought and science what expansion of views and profounder resources does the genius and performance of this last imply if she can make another step as large what new ages open cxxvii emerson to carlyle mrs masseys manchester fenny place fenny st november ah my dear friend all these days have gone and you have had no word from me when the shuttles fly so swiftly in your english loom and in so few hours we may have tidings of the best that live at last and only this day for the first day i am stablished in my own lodgings on english ground and have a fair parlor and chamber into both of which the sun and moon shine into which friendly people have already entered hitherto i have been the victim of trifles which is the fate and the chief objection to traveling days are absorbed in precious nothings but now that i am in some sort a citizen of manchester and also of liverpool for there also i am to enter on lodgings tomorrow at stafford street islington perhaps the social heart of this english world will include me also in its strong and healthful circulations i get the best letters from home by the last steamers and was much occupied in liverpool yesterday in seeing dr nichol of glasgow who was to sail in the acadia and in giving him credentials to some americans i find here a very kind reception from your friends as they emphatically are ireland espinasse miss jewsbury dr hodgson and a circle expanding on all sides outward and mrs paulet at liverpool i am learning there also to know friendly faces and a certain roscoe club has complimented me with its privileges the oddest part of my new position is my alarming penny correspondence which what with welcomes invitations to lecture proffers of hospitality suggestions from good swedenborgists and others for my better guidance touching the titles of my discourses c c all requiring answers threaten to eat up a day like a cherry in this fog and miscellany and until the heavenly sun shall give me one beam will not you friend and joy of so many years send me a quiet line or two now and then to say that you still smoke your pipe in peace side by side with wife and brother also well and smoking or able to smoke now that i have in some measure calmed down the astonishment and consternation of seeing your dreams change into realities i mean at my next approximation or perihelion to behold you with the most serene and sceptical calmness so give my thanks and true affectionate remembrance to jane carlyle and my regards also to dr carlyle whose precise address please also to send me ever your loving rwe the address at the top of this note is the best for the present as i mean to make this my centre cxxviii carlyle to emerson chelsea november dear emerson your bookparcels were faithfully sent off directly after your departure in regard to one of them i had a pleasant visit from the proprietor in person the young swedenborgian doctor whom to my surprise i found quite an agreeable accomplished secular young gentleman much given to progress of the species c c from whom i suppose you have yourself heard the wandering umbrella still short of an owner hangs upon its peg here without definite outlook of yourself there have come news by your own letter and by various excerpts from manchester newspapers gluck zu this morning i received the enclosed and send it off to you without farther response mudie if i mistake not is some small bookseller in the russellsquare region pray answer him if you think him worthy of answer a dim suspicion haunts me that perhaps he was the republisher or pirate of your first set of essays but probably he regards this as a mere office of untutored friendship on his part or possibly i do the poor man wrong by misremembrance chapman could tell i am sunk deep here in effete manuscripts in abstruse meditations in confusions old and new sinking as i may describe myself through stratum after stratum of the inane down to one knows not what depth i unfortunately belong to the opposition party in many points and am in a minority of one to keep silence therefore is among the principal duties at present we had a call from bancroft the other evening a tough yankee man of many worthy qualities more tough than musical among which it gratified me to find a certain small undercurrent of genial humor or as it were hidden laughter not noticed heretofore my wife and all the rest of us are well and do all salute you with our true wishes and the hope to have you here again before long do not bother yourself with other than voluntary writing to me while there is so much otherwise that you are obliged to write if on any point you want advice information or other help that lies within the limits of my strength command me now and always and so good be with you and a happy meeting to us soon again yours ever truly t carlyle cxxix carlyle to emerson chelsea november dear emerson here is a word for you from miss fuller i send you the cover also though i think there is little or nothing in that it contained another little note for mazzini who is wandering in foreign parts on paths unknown to me at present pray send my regards to miss fuller when you write we hear of you pretty often and of your successes with the northern populations we hope for you in london again before long i am busy if at all altogether inarticulately in these days my respect for silence my distrust of speech seem to grow upon me there is a time for both says solomon but we in our poor generation have forgotten one of the times here is a mr forster of rawdon or bradford in yorkshire our late host in the autumn time who expects and longs to be yours when you come into those parts i am busy with william conquerors domesday book and with the commentaries of various blockheads on it ah me all good be with you and happy news from those dear to you yours ever t carlyle now the rt hon w e forster mp cxxx emerson to carlyle fenny street higher broughton manchester december dear carlyle i am concerned to discover that margaret fuller in the letter which you forwarded prays me to ask you and mrs carlyle respecting the count and countess pepoli who are in rome for the winter whether they would be good for her to know that is pretty nearly the form of her question as one third of the winter is gone and one half will be before her question can be answered i fear it will have lost some of its pertinence well it will serve as a token to pass between us which will please me if it do not margaret i have had nothing to send you tidings of yet i get the best accounts from home of wife and babes and friends i am seeing this england more thoroughly than i had thought was possible to me i find this lecturing a key which opens all doors i have received everywhere the kindest hospitality from a great variety of persons i see many intelligent and wellinformed persons and some fine geniuses i have every day a better opinion of the english who are a very handsome and satisfactory race of men and in the point of material performance altogether incomparable i have made some vain attempts to end my lectures but must go on a little longer with kindest regards to the lady jane your friend rwe margaret fullers address if anything is to be written is care of maquay pakenham co rome cxxxi carlyle to emerson chelsea december my dear emerson we are very glad to see your handwriting again and learn that you are well and doing well our news of you hitherto from the dim lectureelement had been satisfactory indeed but vague go on and prosper i do not much think miss fuller would do any great good with the pepolis even if they are still in rome and not at bologna as our advices here seemed to indicate madam pepoli is an elderly scotch lady of excellent commonplace vernacular qualities hardly of more the count some years younger and a much airier man is on all sides a beautiful dilettante little suitable i fear to the serious mind that can recognize him as such however if the people are still in rome miss fuller can easily try bid miss fuller present my wifes compliments or mine or even yours for they know all our domesticities here and are very intimate especially madam with my dame upon which the acquaintance is at once made and can be continued if useful this morning richard milnes writes to me for your address which i have sent he is just returned out of spain home swiftly to vote for the jew bill is doing hospitalities at woburn abbey and i suppose will be in yorkshire home near pontefract before long see him if you have opportunity a man very easy to see and get into flowing talk with a man of much sharpness of faculty well tempered by several inches of christian fat he has upon his ribs for covering one of the idlest cheeriest most gifted of fat little men tennyson has been here for three weeks dining daily till he is near dead setting out a poem withal he came in to us on sunday evening last and on the preceding sunday a truly interesting son of earth and son of heaven who has almost lost his way among the willowisps i doubt and may flounder ever deeper over neck and nose at last among the quagmires that abound i like him well but can do next to nothing for him milnes with general cooperation got him a pension and he has bread and tobacco but that is a poor outfit for such a soul he wants a task and alas that of spinning rhymes and naming it art and high art in a time like ours will never furnish him for myself i have been entirely idle i dare not even say too abstrusely occupied for i have merely been looking at the chaos even not by any means working in it i have not even read a book that i liked all literature has grown inexpressibly unsatisfactory to me better be silent than talk farther in this mood we are going off on saturday come a week into hampshire to certain friends you have heard me speak of our address till the beginning of february is hon wb baring alverstoke gosport hants my wife sends you many kind regards remember us across the ocean too and be well and busy till we meet yours ever t carlyle last night there arrived no of the massachusetts review beautiful paper and print and very promising otherwise in the introduction i well recognized the hand in the first article too not in any of the others faustum sit cxxxii emerson to carlyle ambleside february my dear carlyle i am here in miss martineaus house and having seen a good deal of england and lately a good deal of scotland too i am tomorrow to set forth again for manchester and presently for london yesterday i saw wordsworth for a good hour and a half which he did not seem to grudge for he talked freely and fast and bating his cramping toryism and what belongs to it wisely enough he is in rude health and though seventyseven years old says he does not feel his age in any particular miss martineau is in excellent health and spirits though just now annoyed by the hesitations of murray to publish her book but she confides infinitely in her book which is the best fortune but i please myself not a little that i shall in a few days see you again and i will give you an account of my journey i have heard almost nothing of your late weeks but that is my fault only i heard with sorrow that your wife had been ill and could not go with you on your christmas holidays now may her good days have come again i say i have heard nothing of your late days of your early days of your genius of your influence i cease not to hear and to see continually yea often am called upon to resist the same with might and main but i will not pester you with it now miss martineau who is most happily placed here and a model of housekeeping sends kindest remembrances to you both yours ever r w emerson eastern life past and present cxxxiii carlyle to emerson chelsea february dear emerson we are delighted to hear of you again at first hand our last traditions represented you at edinburgh and left the prospect of your return hither very vague i have only time for one word tonight to say that your room is standing vacant ever since you quitted it ready to be lighted up with all manner of physical and moral fires that the place will yield and is in fact your room and expects to be accounted such i know not specially what your operations in this quarter are to be but whatever they are or the arrangements necessary for them surely it is here that you must alight again in the big babel and deliberately adjust what farther is to be done write to us what day you are to arrive and the rest is all already managed jane has never yet got out since the cold took her but she has at no time been so ill as is frequent with her in these winter disorders she is now steadily improving and we expect will come out with the sun and the green leaves as she usually does i too caught an ugly cold and what is very uncommon with me a kind of cough while down in hampshire which with other inarticulate matters has kept me in a very mute abstruse condition all this while so that for many weeks past i have properly had no history except such as trees in winter and other merely passive objects may have that is not an agreeable side of the page but i find it

sunday that after our call on the lady harriet we will take a stroll through the park look at the sunday population and find ourselves here at five oclock for the above important object pray remember therefore and no excuse in haste yours ever truly t carlyle lady ashburton cxxxviii carlyle to emerson chelsea december dear emerson we received your letter duly some time ago with many welcomes and have as you see been too remiss in answering it not from forgetfulness if you will take my word no but from many causes too complicated to articulate and justly producing an indisposition to put pen to paper at all never was i more silent than in these very months and with reason too for the world at large and my own share of it in small are both getting more and more unspeakable with any convenience in health we of this household are about as well as usual and look across to the woods of concord with more light than we had realizing for ourselves a most mild and friendly picture there perhaps it is quite as well that you are left alone of foreign interference even of a letter from chelsea till you get your huge bale of english reminiscences assorted a little nobody except me seems to have heard from you at least the rest in these parts all plead destitution when i ask for news what you saw and suffered and enjoyed here will if you had once got it properly warehoused be new wealth to you for many years of one impression we fail not here admiration of your pacific virtues of gentle and noble tolerance often sorely tried in this place forgive me my ferocities you do not quite know what i suffer in these latitudes or perhaps it would be even easier for you peace for me in a mother of dead dogs like this there is not was not will not be till the battle itself end which however is a sure outlook and daily growing a nearer one the letter is missing but a fragment of the rough draft of it exists dated concord october emerson had returned home in july and he begins t is high time no doubt long since that you heard from me and if there were good news in america for you you would be sure to hear all goes at heavy trot with us i fell again quickly into my obscure habits more fit for me than the fine things i had seen i made my best endeavor to praise the rich country i had seen and its excellent energetic polished people and it is very easy for me to do so england is the country of success and success has a great charm for me more than for those i talk with at home but they were obstinate to know if the english were superior to their possessions and if the old religion warmed their hearts and lifted a little the mountain of wealth so i enumerated the list of brilliant persons i had seen and the break in ms but the question returned did you find kings and priests did you find sanctities and beauties that took away your memory and sent you home a changed man with new aims and with a discontent of your old pastures here the fragment ends emersons answer to these questions may be found in the chapter entitled results in his english traits nay there is another practical question but it is from the female side of the house to the female side and in fact concerns indian meal upon which mrs emerson or you or the miller of concord if he have any tincture of philosophy are now to instruct us the fact is potatoes having vanished here we are again with motives large and small trying to learn the use of indian meal and indeed do eat it daily to meat at dinner though hitherto with considerable despair question first therefore is there by nature a bitter final taste which makes the throat smart and disheartens much the apprentice in indian meal or is it accidental and to be avoided we surely anticipate the latter answer but do not yet see how at first we were taught the meal all ground on your side of the water had got fusty raw an effect we are well used to in oaten and other meals but last year we had a bushel of it ground here and the bitter taste was there as before with the addition of much dirt and sand our millstones i suppose being too soft whereupon we incline to surmise that there is perhaps as in the case of oats some pellicle or hull that ought to be rejected in making the meal pray ask some philosophic miller if mrs emerson or you do not know and as a corollary this second question what is the essential difference between white or browngraywhite indian meal and yellow the kind we now have beautiful as new guineas but with an ineffaceable tastekin of soot in it and question third which includes all how to cook mush rightly at least without bitter longcontinued boiling seems to help the bitterness but does not cure it let some oracle speak i tell all people our staff of life is in the mississippi valley henceforth and one of the truest benefactors were an american minerva who could teach us to cook this meal which our people at present i included are unanimous in finding nigh uneatable and loudly exclaimable against elihu burritt had a string of recipes that went through all newspapers three years ago but never sang there oracle of longer ears than that totally destitute of practical significance to any creature here and now enough of questioning alas alas i have a quite other batch of sad and saddest considerations on which i must not so much as enter at present death has been very busy in this little circle of ours within these few days you remember charles buller to whom i brought you over that night at the barings in stanhope street he died this day week almost quite unexpectedly a sore loss to all that knew him personally and his gladdening sunny presence in many circles here a sore loss to the political people too for he was far the cleverest of all whig men and indeed the only genial soul one can remember in that department of things we buried him yesterday and now see what new thing has come lord ashburton who had left his mother well in hampshire ten hours before is summoned from poor bullers funeral by telegraph hurries back finds his mother whom he loved much already dead she was a miss bingham i think from pennsylvania perhaps from philadelphia itself you saw her but the first sight by no means told one all or the best worth that was in that good lady we are quite bewildered by our own regrets and by the far painfuler sorrow of those closely related to these sudden sorrows of which let me be silent for the present and indeed of all things else for speech inadequate mockery of ones poor meaning is quite a burden to me just now the reader of carlyles reminiscences and of froudes volumes of his biography is familiar with the close relations that had existed between buller and carlyle neuberg comes hither sometimes a welcome wise kind of man poor little espinasse still toils cheerily at the oar and various friends of yours are about us brother john did send through chapman all the dante which we calculate you have received long ago he is now come to town doing a preface c which also will be sent to you and just about publishing helps who has been alarmingly ill and touring on the rhine since we were his guests writes to me yesterday from hampshire about sending you a new book of his i instructed him how adieu dear emerson do not forget us or forget to think as kindly as you can of us while we continue in this world together yours ever affectionately t carlyle mr ireland in his recollections p gives an interesting account of mr neuberg a highly cultivated german who assisted carlyle in some of the later literary labors of his life neuberg died in and in a letter to his sister of that year carlyle says no kinder friend had i in this world no man of my day i believe had so faithful loyal and willing a helper as he generously was to me for the last twenty or more years cxxxix emerson to carlyle boston january my dear carlyle here in boston for the day though in no fit place for writing you shall have since the steamer goes tomorrow a hasty answer to at least one of your questions you tell me heavy news of your friends and of those who were friendly to me for your sake and i have found farther particulars concerning them in the newspapers buller i have known by name ever since he was in america with lord durham and i well remember his face and figure at mr barings even england cannot spare an accomplished man since i had your letter and i believe by the same steamer your brothers dante complete within and without has come to me most welcome i heartily thank him t is a most workmanlike book bearing every mark of honest value i thank him for myself and i thank him in advance for our people who are sure to learn their debt to him in the coming months and years i sent the book after short examination the same day to new york to the harpers lest their edition should come out without prolegomena but they answered the next day that they had already received directly the same matter yet have not up to this time returned my book for the indian corn i have been to see dr charles t jackson my wifes brother and our best chemist inventor of etherization who tells me that the reason your meal is bitter is that all the corn sent to you from us is kilndried here usually at a heat of three hundred degrees which effectually kills the starch or diastase which would otherwise become sugar this drying is thought necessary to prevent the corn from becoming musty in the contingency of a long voyage he says if it should go in the steamer it would arrive sound without previous drying i think i will try that experiment shortly on a box or a barrel of our concord maize as lidian emerson confidently engages to send you accurate recipes for johnnycake mush and hominy the inferno of dante a translation in prose by john carlyle an excellent piece of work still in demand why did you not send me word of cloughs hexameter poem which i have now received and read with much joy but no you will never forgive him his metres he is a stout solid reliable man and friend i knew well but this fine poem has taken me by surprise i cannot find that your journals have yet discovered its existence with kindest remembrances to jane carlyle and new thanks to john carlyle your friend rw emerson the bothie of tobernavuolich cxl carlyle to emerson chelsea april my dear emerson today is american postday and by every rule and law even if all laws but those of cocker were abolished from this universe a word from me is due to you twice i have heard since i spoke last prompt response about the philadelphia bill exact performance of your voluntary promise indian corn itself is now here for a week past still more interesting is the barrel of genuine corn ears indian cobs of edible grain from the barn of emerson himself it came all safe and right according to your charitable program without cost or trouble to us of any kind not without curious interest and satisfaction the recipes contained in the precedent letter duly weighed by the competent jury of housewives at least by my own wife and lady ashburton were judged to be of decided promise reasonablelooking every one of them and now that the stuff itself is come i am happy to assure you that it forms a new epoch for us all in the maize department we find the grain sweet among the sweetest with a touch even of the taste of nuts in it and profess with contrition that properly we have never tasted indian corn before millers of due faculty with millstones of iron being scarce in the cockney region and even cooks liable to err the ashburtons have on their resources undertaken the brunt of the problem one of their own surrey or hampshire millers is to grind the stuff and their own cook a frenchman commander of a whole squadron is to undertake the dressing according to the rules yesterday the barrel went off to their country place in surrey a small bag of select ears being retained here for our own private experimenting and so by and by we shall see what comes of it i on my side have already drawn up a fit proclamation of the excellences of this invaluable corn and admonitions as to the benighted state of english eaters in regard to it to appear in frasers magazine or i know not where very soon it is really a small contribution towards worldhistory this small act of yours and ours there is no doubt to me now that i taste the real grain but all europe will henceforth have to rely more and more upon your western valleys and this article how beautiful to think of lean tough yankee settlers tough as guttapercha with most occult unsubduable fire in their belly steering over the western mountains to annihilate the jungle and bring bacon and corn out of it for the posterity of adam the pigs in about a year eat up all the rattlesnakes for miles round a most judicious function on the part of the pigs behind the pigs comes jonathan with his allconquering ploughshare glory to him too oh if we were not a set of cantridden blockheads there is no myth of athene or herakles equal to this fact which i suppose will find its real poets some day or other when once the greek semitic and multifarious other cobwebs are swept away a little well we must wait for the rest if this skillful naturalist and you will make any more experiments on indian corn for us might i not ask that you would try for a method of preserving the meal in a sound state for us oatmeal which would spoil directly too is preserved all year by kilndrying the grain before it is ground parching it till it is almost brown sometimes the scotch highlanders by intense parching can keep their oatmeal good for a series of years no miller here at present is likely to produce such beautiful meal as some of the american specimens i have seen if possible we must learn to get the grain over in the shape of proper durable meal at all events let your friend charitably make some inquiry into the process of millerage the possibilities of it for meeting our case and send us the result some day on a separate bit of paper with which let us end for the present alas i have yet written nothing am yet a long way off writing i fear not for want of matter perhaps but for redundance of it i feel as if i had the whole world to write yet with the day fast bending downwards on me and did not know where to begin in what manner to address the deepsunk populations of the theban land any way my life is very grim on these terms and is like to be god only knows what farther quantity of braying in the mortar this foolish clay of mine may yet need they are printing a third edition of cromwell that bothered me for some weeks but now i am over with that and the printer wholly has it a sorrowful not now or ever a joyful thing to me that the stupor of my fellow blockheads for centuries back presses too heavy upon that as upon many things o heavens people are about setting up some statue of cromwell at st ives or elsewhere the kinghudson statue is never yet set up and the king himself as you may have heard has been discovered swindling i advise all men not to erect a statue for cromwell just now macaulays history is also out running through the fourth edition did i tell you last time that i had read it with wonder and amazement finally it seems likely lord john russell will shortly walk out forever it is hoped and sir r peel come in to make what effort is in him towards delivering us from the pedant method of treating ireland the beginning as i think of salvation if he can prosper a little to england and to all europe as well for they will all have to learn that man does need government and that an able bodied starving beggar is and remains whatever exeter hall may say to it a slave destitute of a master of which facts england and convulsed europe are fallen foundly ignorant in these bad ages and will plunge ever deeper till they rediscover the same alas alas the future for us is not to be made of butter as the platforms prophesy i think it will be harder than steel for some ages no noble age was ever a soft one nor ever will or can be your beautiful curious little discourse report of a discourse about the english was sent me by neuberg i thought it in my private heart one of the best words for hidden genius lodged in it i had ever heard so sent it to the examiner from which it went to the times and all the other papers an excellent sly little word clough has gone to italy i have seen him twice could not manage his hexameters though i like the man himself and hope much of him infidelity has broken out in oxford itself immense emotion in certain quarters in consequence virulent outcries about a certain sterling club altogether a secular society adieu dear emerson i had much more to say but there is no room o forgive me forgive me all trespasses and love me what you can yours ever t carlyle cxli carlyle to emerson scotsbrig ecclefechan nb august dear emerson by all laws of human computation i owe you a letter and have owed any time these seven weeks let me now pay a little and explain your second barrel of indian corn arrived also perfectly fresh and of admirable taste and quality the very bag of newground meal was perfect and the popped corn ditto when it came to be discovered with the whole of which admirable materials such order was taken as promised to secure the greatest happiness to the greatest number and due silent thanks were tendered to the beneficence of the unwearied sender but all this you shall observe had to be done in the thick of a universal packing and household bustle i just on the wing for a tour in ireland my wife too contemplating a run to scotland shortly after there to meet me on my return all this was seven good weeks ago i hoped somewhere in my irish wayfarings to fling you off a letter but alas i reckoned there quite without my host strict host called time finding nowhere half a minute left to me and so now having got home to my mother not to see my wife yet for some days it is my earliest leisure after all that i employ in this purpose i have been terribly knocked about too jolted in irish cars bothered almost to madness with irish balderdash above all kept on dreadfully short allowance of sleep so that now first when fairly down to rest all aches and bruises begin to be fairly sensible and my clearest feeling at this present is the uncomfortable one that i am not caliban but a cramp terribly cramped indeed if i could tell you everything what the other results of this irish tour are to be for me i cannot in the least specify for one thing i seem to be farther from speech on any subject than ever such masses of chaotic ruin everywhere fronted me the general fruit of longcontinued universal falsity and folly and such mountains of delusion yet possessing all hearts and tongues i could do little that was not even noxious except admire in silence the general bankruptcy of imposture as one there finds and sees it come to pass and think with infinite sorrow of the tribulations futile wrestlings tumults and disasters which yet await that unfortunate section of adams posterity before any real improvement can take place among them alas alas the gospels of political economy of laissezfaire nogovernment paradise to all comers and so many fatal gospels generally one may say all the gospels of this blessed new era will first have to be tried and found wanting with a quantity of written and uttered nonsense and of suffered and inflicted misery which one sinks fairly dumb to estimate a kind of comfort it is however to see that imposture has fallen openly bankrupt here as everywhere else in our old world that no dexterity of human tinkering with all the parliamentary eloquence and elective franchises in nature will ever set it on its feet again to go many yards more but that its goings and currencies in this earth have as good as ceased for ever and ever god is great all lies do now as from the first travel incessantly towards chaos and there at length lodge in some parts of ireland the western insolvent unions some twentyseven of them in all within a trifle of one half of the whole population are on poorlaw rations furnished by the british government l a week furnished here l there l there the houses stand roofless the lands unstocked uncultivated the landlords hidden from bailiffs living sometimes on the hares of their domain such a state of things was never witnessed under this sky before and one would humbly expect cannot last long what is to be done asks every one incapable of hearing any answer were there even one ready for imparting to him blacklead these two million idle beggars i sometimes advised and sell them in brazil as niggers perhaps parliament on sweet constraint will allow you to advance them to be niggers in fact the emancipation societies should send over a deputation or two to look at these immortal irish freemen the ne plus ultra of their class it would perhaps moderate the windpipe of much eloquence one hears on that subject is not this the most illustrious of all ages making progress of the species at a grand rate indeed peace be with it waiting for me here there was a letter from miss fuller in rome written about a month ago a dignified and interesting letter requesting help with booksellers for some history of the late italian revolution she is about writing and elegiacally recognizing the worth of mazzini and other cognate persons and things i instantly set about doing what little seemed in my power towards this object with what result is yet hidden and have written to the heroic margaret more power to her elbow as the irish say she has a beautiful enthusiasm and is perhaps in the right stage of insight for doing that piece of business well of other persons or interests i will say nothing till a calmer opportunity which surely cannot be very long in coming in four days i am to rejoin my wife after which some bits of visits are to be paid in this north country necessary most of them not likely to be profitable almost any in perhaps a month i expect to be back in chelsea whither direct a word if you are still beneficent enough to think of such a castaway yours ever t carlyle i got thoreaus book and meant well to read it but have not yet succeeded though it went with me through all ireland tell him so please too jeanpaulish i found it hitherto cxlii carlyle to emerson chelsea july my dear emerson my friend my friend you behold before you a remorseful man it is wellnigh a year now since i despatched some hurried rag of paper to you out of scotland indicating doubtless that i would speedily follow it with a longer letter and here when gray autumn is at hand again i have still written nothing to you heard nothing from you it is miserable to think of and yet it is a fact and there is no denying of it and so we must let it lie if it please heaven the like shall not occur again ohone arooh as the irish taught me to say ohone arooh the fact is my life has been black with care and toil labor above board and far worse labor below i have hardly had a heavier year overloaded too with a kind of health which may be called frightful to burn my own smoke in some measure has really been all i was up to and except on sheer immediate compulsion i have not written a word to any creature yesternight i finished the last of these extraordinary pamphlets am about running off somewhither into the deserts of wales or scotland scandinavia or still remoter deserts and my first signal of revived reminiscence is to you nay i have not at any time forgotten you be that justice done the unfortunate and though i see well enough what a great deep cleft divides us in our ways of practically looking at this world i see also as probably you do yourself where the rock strata miles deep unite again and the two poor souls are at one poor devils nay if there were no point of agreement at all and i were more intolerant of ways of thinking than i even am yet has not the man emerson from old years been a human friend to me can i ever forget or think otherwise than lovingly of the man emerson no more of this write to me in your first good hour and say that there is still a brothersoul left to me alive in this world and a kind thought surviving far over the sea chapman with due punctuality at the time of publication sent me the representative men which i read in the becoming manner you now get the book offered you for a shilling at all railway stations and indeed i perceive the word representative man as applied to the late tragic loss we have had in sir robert peel has been adopted by the able editors and circulates through newspapers as an appropriate household word which is some compensation to you for the piracy you suffer from the typographic letterofmarque men here i found the book a most finished clear and perfect set of engravings in the line manner portraitures full of likeness and abounding in instruction and materials for reflection to me thanks always for such a book and heaven send us many more of them plato i think though it is the most admired by many did least for me little save socrates with his clogs and big ears remains alive with me from it swedenborg is excellent in likeness excellent in many respects yet i said to myself on reaching your general conclusion about the man and his struggles missed the consummate flower and divine ultimate elixir of philosophy say you by heaven in clutching at it and almost getting it he has tumbled into bedlam which is a terrible miss if it were never so near a miss fully as good as a mile i should say in fact i generally dissented a little about the end of all these essays which was notable and not without instructive interest to me as i had so lustily shouted hear hear all the way from the beginning up to that stage on the whole let us have another book with your earliest convenience that is the modest request one makes of you on shutting this i know not what i am now going to set about the horrible barking of the universal dogkennel awakened by these pamphlets must still itself again my poor nerves must recover themselves a little i have much more to say and by heavens blessing must try to get it said in some way if i live bostonian prescott is here infinitely lionized by a mob of gentlemen i have seen him in two places or three but forbore speech the johnnycake is good the twopence worth of currants in it too are good but if you offer it as a bit of baked ambrosia ach gott adieu dear emerson forgive and love me a little yours ever t carlyle cxliii carlyle to emerson chelsea november dear emerson you are often enough present to my thoughts but yesterday there came a little incident which has brought you rather vividly upon the scene for me a certain mr from boston sends us yesterday morning by post a note of yours addressed to mazzini whom he cannot find and indicates that he retains a similar one addressed to myself and in the most courteous kindly and dignified manner if mercy prevent not is about carrying it off with him again to america to give mercy a chance i by the first opportunity get under way for morleys hotel the address of mr find there that mr since morning has been on the road towards liverpool and america and that the function of mercy is quite extinct in this instance my reflections as i wandered home again were none of the pleasantest of this mr i had heard some tradition as of an intelligent accomplished and superior man such a mans acquaintance of whatever complexion he be is and was always a precious thing to me well worth acquiring where possible not to say that any friend of yours whatever his qualities otherwise carries with him an imperative key to all bolts and locks of mine real or imaginary in fact i felt punished and who knows if the case were seen into whether i deserve it what business it was that deprived me of a call from mr or of the possibility of calling on him i know very well and the little dog and others know but the fact in that matter is very far different indeed from the superficial semblance and i appeal to all the gentlemen that are in america for a candid interpretation of the same eighteen million bores good heavens dont i know how many of that species we also have and how with us as with you the difference between them and the eighteen thousand noblemen and nonbores is immeasurable and inconceivable and how with us as with you the latter small company sons of the empyrean will have to fling the former huge one sons of mammon and mud into some kind of chains again reduce them to some kind of silence again unless the old muddemons are to rise and devour us all truly it is so i construe it and if and the eighteen millions are well justified in their anger at me and the eighteen thousand owe me thanks and new love that is my decided opinion in spite of you all and so along with probably in the same ship with him there shall go my protest against the conduct of and the declaration that to the last i will protest which will wind up the matter without any word of yours on it at this time for the rest though sent me his pamphlet it is a fact i have not read a word of it nor shall ever read my wife read it but i was away with far other things in my head and it was lent to various persons till it died enough and ten times more than enough of all that let me on this last slip of paper give you some response to the letter i got in scotland under the silence of the bright autumn sun in my mothers house and read there this letter is missing you are bountiful abundantly in your reception of those latter day pamphlets and right in all you say of them and yet withal you are not right my friend but i am truly it does behove a man to know the inmost resources of this universe and for the sake both of his peace and of his dignity to possess his soul in patience and look nothing doubting nothing wincing even if that be his humor upon all things for it is most indubitable there is good in all and if you even see an oliver cromwell assassinated it is certain you may get a cartload of turnips from his carcass ah me and i suppose we had too much forgotten all this or there had not been a man like you sent to show it us so emphatically let us well remember it and yet remember too that it is not good always or ever to be at ease in zion good often to be in fierce rage in zion and that the vile pythons of this mudworld do verily require to have sunarrows shot into them and redhot pokers struck through them according to occasion woe to the man that carries either of these weapons and does not use it in their presence here at this moment a miserable italian organgrinder has struck up the marseillaise under my window for example was the marseillaise fought out on a bed of down or is it worth nothing when fought on those wretched pamphlets i set no value at all or even less than none to me their one benefit is my own heart is clear of them a benefit not to be despised i assure you and in the public athwart this storm of curses and emptyings of vessels of dishonor i can already perceive that it is all well enough there too in reference to them and the controversy of the eighteen millions versus the eighteen thousands or eighteen units is going on very handsomely in that quarter of it for aught i can see and so peace to the brave that are departed and tomorrow to fresh fields and pastures new i was in wales as well as scotland during autumn time lived three weeks within wind of st germanuss old college fourteen hundred years of age or so and also not far from merthyr tydvil cyclops hell sootiest and horridest avatar of the industrial mammon i had ever anywhere seen went through the severn valley at bath stayed a night with landor a proud and high old man who charged me with express remembrances for you saw tennyson too in cumberland with his new wife and other beautiful recommendable and questionable things and was dreadfully tossed about and torn almost to tatters by the manifold brambles of my way and so at length am here a much lamed man indeed oh my friend have tolerance for me have sympathy with me you know not quite i imagine what a burden mine is or perhaps you would find this duty which you always do a little easier done be happy be busy beside your still waters and think kindly of me there my nerves health i call them are in a sad state of disorder alas that is nine tenths of all the battle in this world courage courage my wife sends salutations to you and yours good be with you all always your affectionate t carlyle cxliv carlyle to emerson chelsea july dear emerson dont you still remember very well that there is such a man i know you do and will do but it is a ruinously long while since we have heard a word from each other a state of matters that ought immediately to cease it was your turn i think to write it was somebodys turn nay i heard lately you complained of bad eyes and were grown abstinent of writing pray contradict me this i cannot do without some regard from you while we are both here spite of your many sins you are among the most human of all the beings i now know in the world who are a very select set and are growing ever more so i can inform you in late months feeling greatly broken and without heart for anything weighty i have been upon a life of john sterling which will not be good for much but will as usual gratify me by taking itself off my hands it was one of the things i felt a kind of obligation to do and so am thankful to have done here is a patch of it lying by me if you will look at a specimen there are four hundred or more pages prophesies the printer a good many letters and excerpts in the latter portion of the volume already half printed wholly written but not to come out for a couple of months yet all trade being at a stand till this sublime crystal palace go its ways again and now since we are upon the business i wish you would mention it to ep clark is not that the name next time you go to boston if that friendly cleareyed man have anything to say in reference to it and american booksellers let him say and do he may have a copy for anybody in about a month if he have nothing to say then let there be nothing anywhere said for mark o philosopher i expressly and with emphasis prohibit you at this stage of our history and henceforth unless i grow poor again indeed indeed the commercial mandate of the thing natures little order on that behalf being once fulfilled by speaking to clark i do not care a snuff of tobacco how it goes and will prefer here as elsewhere my nights rest to any amount of superfluous money this summer as you may conjecture has been very noisy with us and productive of little the winddustry of all nations involving everything in one inane tornado the very shopkeepers complain that there is no trade such a sanhedrim of windy fools from all countries of the globe were surely never gathered in one city before but they will go their ways again they surely will one sits quiet in that faith nay looks abroad with a kind of pathetic grandfatherly feeling over this universal childrens ball which the british nation in these extraordinary circumstances is giving it self silence above all silence is very behoveful i read lately a small old brown french duodecimo which i mean to send you by the first chance there is the writer is a capitaine bossu the production a journal of his experiences in la louisiane oyo ohio and those regions which looks very genuine and has a strange interest to me like some fractional odyssey or letter only a hundred years ago and the mississippi has changed as never valley did in older and stranger looked at from its present date than balbec or nineveh say what we will jonathan is doing miracles of a sort under the sun in these times now passing do you know bartrams travels this is of the seventies or so treats of florida chiefly has a wondrous kind of floundering eloquence in it and has also grown immeasurably old all american libraries ought to provide themselves with that kind of book and keep them as a kind of future biblical article finally on this head can you tell me of any good book on california good i have read several bad but that too is worthy of some wonder that too like the old bucaniers hungers and thirsts in ingenuous minds to have some true record and description given of it bossu wrote two books which are known to the student of the history of the settlement of america one nouveaux voyages aux indes occidentales paris the other nouveaux voyages dans lamerique septentrionale amsterdam paris and poor miss fuller was there any life ever published of her or is any competent hand engaged on it poor margaret i often remember her and think how she is asleep now under the surges of the sea mazzini as you perhaps know is with us this summer comes across once in the week or so and tells me or at least my wife all his news the roman revolution has made a man of him quite brightened up ever since and the best friend he ever saw i believe was that same quackpresident of france who relieved him while it was still time my brother is in annandale working hard over dante at last talks of coming up hither shortly i am myself very ill and miserable in the liver regions very tough otherwise though i have now got spectacles for small print in the twilight eheu fugaces and yet why eheu in fact it is better to be silent adieu dear emerson i expect to get a great deal brisker by and by and in the first place to have a missive from boston again my wife sends you many regards i am as ever affectionately yours t carlyle cxlv emerson to carlyle concord july my dear carlyle you must always thank me for silence be it never so long and must put on it the most generous interpretations for i am too sure of your genius and goodness and too glad that they shine steadily for all to importune you to make assurance sure by a private beam very often there is very little in this village to be said to you and with all my love of your letters i think it the kind part to defend you from our imbecilities my own and other mens besides my eyes are bad and prone to mutiny at any hint of white paper and yet i owe you all my story if story i have i have been something of a traveler the last year and went down the ohio river to its mouth walked nine miles into and nine miles out of the mammoth cave in kentucky walked or sailed for we crossed small underground streams and lost one days light then steamed up the mississippi five days to galena in the upper mississippi you are always in a lake with many islands the far west is the right name for these verdant deserts on all the shores interminable silent forest if you land there is prairie behind prairie forest behind forest sites of nations no nations the raw bullion of nature what we call moral value not yet stamped on it but in a thousand miles the immense material values will show twenty or fifty californias that a good ciphering head will make one where he is thus at pittsburg on the ohio the iron city whither from want of railroads few yankees have penetrated every acre of land has three or four bottoms first of rich soil then nine feet of bituminous coal a little lower fourteen feet of coal then iron or salt salt springs with a valuable oil called petroleum floating on their surface yet this acre sells for the price of any tillage acre in massachusetts and in a year the railroads will reach it east and west i came home by the great northern lakes and niagara no books a few lectures each winter i write and read in the spring the abomination of our fugitive slave bill drove me to some writing and speechmaking without hope of effect but to clear my own skirts i am sorry i did not print whilst it was yet time i am now told that the time will come again mores the pity now i am trying to make a sort of memoir of margaret fuller or my part in one for channing and ward are to do theirs without either beauty or genius she had a certain wealth and generosity of nature which have left a kind of claim on our consciences to build her a cairn and this reminds me that i am to write a note to mazzini on this matter and as you say you see him you must charge yourself with delivering it what we do must be ended by october you too are working for sterling it is right and kind i learned so much from the new york tribune and a few days after was on the point of writing to you provoked by a foolish paragraph which appeared in rufus griswolds journal new york purporting that rwe possessed important letters of sterling without which thomas carlyle could not write the life what scrap of hearsay about contents of sterlings letters to me or that i had letters this paltry journalist swelled into this puffball i know not he once came to my house and since that time may have known margaret fuller in new york but probably never saw any letter of sterlings or heard the contents of any i have not read again sterlings letters which i keep as good lares in a special niche but i have no recollection of anything that would be valuable to you for the american public for the book i think it important that you should take the precise step of sending phillips and sampson the early copy and at the earliest i saw them and also ep clark and put them in communication and clark is to write you at once having got so far in my writing to you i do not know but i shall gain heart and write more letters over sea you will think my sloth suicidal enough so many men as i learned to value in your country so many as offered me opportunities of intercourse and i lose them all by silence arthur helps is a chief benefactor of mine i wrote him a letter by ward who brought the letter back i ought to thank john carlyle not only for me but for a multitude of good men and women here who read his inferno duly we forster sent me his penn pamphlet i sent it to bancroft who liked it well only he thought forster might have made a still stronger case clough i prize at a high rate the man and his poetry but write not wilkinson i thought a man of prodigious talent who somehow held it and so taught others to hold it cheap as we do one of those bushelbasket memories which schoolboys and schoolgirls often show and we stop their mouths lest they be troublesome with their alarming profusion but there is no need of beginning to count the long catalogue kindest kindest remembrance to my benefactress also in your house and health and strength and victory to you your affectionate waldo emerson cxlvi carlyle to emerson great malvern worcestershire august dear emerson many thanks for your letter which found me here about a week ago and gave a full solution to my bibliopolic difficulties however sore your eyes or however taciturn your mood there is no delay of writing when any service is to be done by it in fact you are very good to me and always were in all manner of ways for which i do as i ought thank the upper powers and you that truly has been and is one of the possessions of my life in this perverse epoch of the world i have sent off by john chapman a copy of the life of sterling which is all printed and ready but is not to appear till the first week of october along with the sheets was a poor little french book for you book of a poor naval mississippi frenchman one bossu i think written only a century ago yet which already seemed old as the pyramids in reference to those strange fastgrowing countries i read it as a kind of defaced romance very thin and lean but all true and very marvelous as such it is above three weeks since my wife and i left london the printer having done and came hither with the purpose of a month of what is called water cure for which this place otherwise extremely pleasant and wholesome has become celebrated of late years dr gully the pontiff of the business in our island warmly encouraged my purpose so soon as he heard of it nay urgently offered at once that both of us should become his own guests till the experiment were tried and here accordingly we are i watercuring assiduously walking on the sunny mountains drinking of the clear wells not to speak of wet wrappages solitary sad steepages and other singular procedures my wife not meddling for her own behoof but only seeing me do it these have been three of the idlest weeks i ever spent and there is still one to come after which we go northward to lancashire and across the border where my good old mother still expects me and so after some little visiting and dawdling hope to find ourselves home again before september end and the inexpressible glass palace with its noisy inanity have taken itself quite away again it was no increase of illhealth that drove me hither rather the reverse but i have long been minded to try this thing and now i think the result will be zero pretty nearly and one imagination the less my long walks my strenuous idleness have certainly done me good nor has the water done me any ill which perhaps is much to say of it for the rest it is a strange quasimonastic godless and yet devotional way of life which human creatures have here and useful to them beyond doubt i foresee this water cure under better forms will become the ramadhan of the overworked unbelieving english in time coming an institution they were dreadfully in want of this long while we had twisleton here often speaking of you who is off to america again will sail i think along with this letter a semiarticulate but solid minded worthy man we have other officials and other litterateurs tb macaulay in his hired villa for one but the mind rather shuns than seeks them one finds solitary quasi devotion preferable and greek as pindar had it the late hon edward twisleton a man of high character and large attainments and with a personal disposition that won the respect and affection of a wide circle of friends on both sides of the atlantic he was the author of a curious and learned treatise entitled the tongue not essential to speech and his remarkable volume on the handwriting of junius seems to have effectually closed a long controversy richard milnes is married about two weeks ago and gone to vienna for a jaunt his wife a miss crewe lord crewes sister about forty pleasant intelligent and rather rich that is the end of richards long first act alfred tennyson perhaps you heard is gone to italy with his wife their baby died or was deadborn they found england wearisome alfred has been taken up on the top of the wave and a good deal jumbled about since you were here item thackeray who is coming over to lecture to you a mad world my masters your letter to mazzini was duly despatched and we hear from him that he will write to you on the subject required without delay browning and his wife home from florence are both in london at present mean to live in paris henceforth for some time they had seen something both of margaret and her dossoli and appeared to have a true and lively interest in them browning spoke a long while to me with emphasis on the subject i think it was i that had introduced poor margaret to them i said he ought to send these reminiscences to america that was the night before we left london three weeks ago his answer gave me the impression there had been some hindrance somewhere accordingly when your letter and mazzinis reached me here i wrote to browning urgently on the subject but he informs me that they have sent all their reminiscences at the request of mr story so that it is already all well dear emerson you see i am at the bottom of my paper i will write to you again before long we cannot let you lie fallow in that manner altogether have you got proper spectacles for your eyes i have adopted that beautiful symbol of old age and feel myself very venerable take care of your eyes yours ever t carlyle cxlvii emerson to carlyle concord april my dear carlyle i have not grown so callous by my sulky habit but that i know where my friends are and who can help me in time of need and i have to crave your good offices today and in a matter relating once more to margaret fuller you were so kind as to interest yourself many months ago to set mazzini and browning on writing their reminiscences for us but we never heard from either of them lately i have learned by way of sam longfellow in paris brother of our poet longfellow that browning assured him that he did write and send a memoir to this country to whom i know not it never arrived at the hands of the fullers nor of story channing or me though the book was delayed in the hope of such help i hate that his paper should be lost the little french voyage c of bossu i got safely and compared its pictures with my own at the mississippi the illinois and chicago it is curious and true enough no doubt though its indians are rather dim and vague and messieurs sauvages good indians we have in alexander henrys travels in canada and in our modern catlin and the best western america perhaps in fa michaux voyage a louest des monts alleghanis and in fremont but it was california i believe you asked about and after looking at taylor parkman and the rest i saw that the only course is to read them all and every private letter that gets into the newspapers so there was nothing to say i rejoiced with the rest of mankind in the life of sterling and now peace will be to his manes down in this lower sphere yet i see well that i should have held to his opinion in all those conferences where you have so quietly assumed the palms it is said here that you work upon frederick the great however that be health strength love joy and victory to you rw emerson cxlviii carlyle to emerson chelsea may dear emerson i was delighted at the sight of your hand again my manifold sins against you involuntary all of them i may well say are often enough present to my sad thoughts and a kind of remorse is mixed with the other sorrow as if i could have helped growing to be by aid of time and destiny the grim ishmaelite i am and so shocking your serenity by my ferocities i admit you were like an angel to me and absorbed in the beautifulest manner all thunderclouds into the depths of your immeasurable a ether and it is indubitable i love you very well and have long done and mean to do and on the whole you will have to rally yourself into some kind of correspondence with me again i believe you will find that also to be a commanded duty by and by to me at any rate i can say it is a great want and adds perceptibly to the sternness of these years deep as is my dissent from your gymnosophist view of heaven and earth i find an agreement that swallows up all conceivable dissents in the whole world i hardly get to my spoken human word any other word of response which is authentically human god help us this is growing a very lonely place this distracted dog kennel of a world and it is no joy to me to see it about to have its throat cut for its immeasurable devilries that is not a pleasant process to be concerned in either more or less considering above all how many centuries base and dismal all of them it is like to take nevertheless marchons and swift too if we have any speed for the sun is sinking poor margaret that is a strange tragedy that history of hers and has many traits of the heroic in it though it is wild as the prophecy of a sibyl such a predetermination to eat this big universe as her oyster or her egg and to be absolute empress of all height and glory in it that her heart could conceive i have not before seen in any human soul her mountain me indeed but her courage too is high and clear her chivalrous nobleness indeed is great her veracity in its deepest sense a toute epreuve your copy of the book came to me at last to my joy i had already read it there was considerable notice taken of it here and one halfvolume of it and i grieve to say only one written by a man called emerson was completely approved by me and innumerable judges the rest of the book is not without considerable geniality and merits but one wanted a clear concise narrative beyond all other merits and if you ask here except in that halfvolume about any fact you are answered so to speak not in words but by a symbolic tune on the bagpipe symbolic burst of windmusic from the brass band which is not the plan at all what can have become of mazzinis letter which he certainly did write and despatched to you is not easily conceivable still less in the case of browning for browning and his wife did also write i myself in the end of last july having heard him talk kindly and well of poor margaret and her husband took the liberty on your behalf of asking him to put something down on paper and he informed me then and repeatedly since he had already done it at the request of mrs story i think his address at present is no avenue des champs elysees a paris if your american travelers still thought of inquiring adieu dear emerson till next week yours ever t carlyle the memoirs of margaret fuller ossoli cxlix emerson to carlyle concord may you make me happy with your loving thoughts and meanings towards me i have always thanked the good star which made us early neighbors in some sort in time and space and the beam is twice warmed by your vigorous goodwill which has steadily kept clear kind eyes on me from an imperfect rough draft it is good to be born in good air and outlook and not less with a civilization that is with one poet still living in the world o yes and i feel all the solemnity and vital cheer of the benefit if only the mountains of water and of land and the steeper mountains of blighted and apathized moods would permit a word to pass now and then it is very fine for you to tax yourself with all those incompatibilities i like that thor should make comets and thunder as well as iduna apples or heimdal his rainbow bridge and your wrath and satire has all too much realism in it than that we can flatter ourselves by disposing of you as partial and heated nor is it your fault that you do a heros work nor do we love you less if we cannot help you in it pity me o strong man i am of a puny constitution half made up and as i from childhood knew not a poet but a lover of poetry and poets and merely serving as writer c in this empty america before the arrival of the poets you must not misconstrue my silences but thank me for them all as a true homage to your diligence which i love to defend she had such reverence and love for landor that i do not know but at any moment in her natural life she would have sunk in the sea for an ode from him and now this most propitious cake is offered to her manes the loss of the notes of browning and of mazzini which you confirm astonishes me margaret fuller the break in continuity is in the rough draft cl carlyle to emerson chelsea june dear emerson you are a born enthusiast as quiet as you are and it will continue so at intervals to the end i admire your sly lowvoiced sarcasm too in short i love the sternlygentle closebuttoned man very well as i have always done and intend to continue doing pray observe therefore and lay it to heart as a practical fact that you are bound to persevere in writing to me from time to time and will never get it given up how sulky soever you grow while we both remain in this world do not i very well understand all that you say about apathized moods c the gloom of approaching old age approaching nay arriving with some of us is very considerable upon a man and on the whole one contrives to take the very ugliest view now and then of all beautifulest things and to shut ones lips with a kind of grim defiance a kind of imperial sorrow which is almost like felicity so completely and composedly wretched one is equal to the very gods these too are necessary moods to a man but the earth withal is verdant sunbeshone and the son of adam has his place on it and his tasks and recompenses in it to the close as one remembers by and by too on the whole i am infinitely solitary but not more heavy laden than i have all along been perhaps rather less so i could fancy even old age to be beautiful and to have a real divineness for the rest i say always i cannot part with you however it go and so in brief you must get into the way of holding yourself obliged as formerly to a kind of dialogue with me and speak on paper since not otherwise the oftenest you can let that be a point settled i am not writing on frederic the great nor at all practically contemplating to do so but being in a reading mood after those furious pamphlets which have procured me showers of abuse from all the extensive genus stupid in this country and not done me any other mischief but perhaps good and not being capable of reading except in a train and about some object of interest to me i took to reading near a year ago about frederick as i had twice in my life done before and have in a loose way tumbled up an immense quantity of shot rubbish on that field and still continue not with much decisive approach to fredericks self i am still afraid the man looks brilliant and noble to me but how love him or the sad wreck he lived and worked in i do not even yet see him clearly and to try making others see him yet voltaire and he are the celestial element of the poor eighteenth century poor souls i confess also to a real love for fredericks dumb followers the prussian soldiery i often say to myself were not here the real priests and virtuous martyrs of that loudbabbling rotten generation and so it goes on when to end or in what to end god knows adieu dear emerson a blockhead by mistake has been let in and has consumed all my time good be ever with you and yours t carlyle cli emerson to carlyle concord april my dear friend as i find i never write a letter except at the dunning of the penny post which is the pest of the century i have thought lately of crossing to england to excuse to you my negligence of your injunction which so flattered me by its affectionateness a year ago i was to write once a month my own disobedience is wonderful and explains to me all the sins of omission of the whole world the levity with which we can let fall into disuse such a sacrament as the exchange of greeting at short periods is a kind of magnanimity and should be an astonishing argument of the immortality and i wonder how it has escaped the notice of philosophers but what had i dear wise man to tell you what but that life was still tolerable still absurdly sweet still promising promising to credulous idleness but step of mine taken in a true direction or clear solution of any the least secret none whatever i scribble always a little much less than formerly and i did within a year or eighteen months write a chapter on fate which if we all live long enough that is you and i and the chapter i hope to send you in fair print comfort yourself as you will you will survive the reading and will be a sure proof that the nut is not cracked for when we find out what fate is i suppose the sphinx and we are done for and sphinx oedipus and world ought by good rights to roll down the steep into the sea but i was going to say my neglect of your request will show you how little saliency is in my weeks and months they are hardly distinguished in memory other than as a running web out of a loom a bright stripe for day a dark stripe for night and when it goes faster even these run together into endless gray i went lately to st louis and saw the mississippi again the powers of the river the insatiate craving for nations of men to reap and cure its harvests the conditions it imposes for it yields to no engineering are interesting enough the prairie exists to yield the greatest possible quantity of adipocere for corn makes pig pig is the export of all the land and you shall see the instant dependence of aristocracy and civility on the fat four legs workingmen ability to do the work of the river abounded nothing higher was to be thought of america is incomplete room for us all since it has not ended nor given sign of ending in bard or hero t is a wild democracy the riot of mediocrities and none of your selfish italies and englands where an age sublimates into a genius and the whole population is made into paddies to feed his porcelain veins by transfusion from their brick arteries our few fine persons are apt to die horatio greenough a sculptor whose tongue was far cunninger in talk than his chisel to carve and who inspired great hopes died two months ago at fortyseven years nature has only so much vital force and must dilute it if it is to be multiplied into millions the beautiful is never plentiful on the whole i say to myself that our conditions in america are not easier or less expensive than the european for the poor scholar everywhere must be compromise or alternation and after many remorses the consoling himself that there has been pecuniary honesty and that things might have been worse but no we must think much better things than these let lazarus believe that heaven does not corrupt into maggots and that heroes do not succumb clough is here and comes to spend a sunday with me now and then he begins to have pupils and if his courage holds out will have as many as he wants i have written hundreds of pages about england and america and may send them to you in print and now be good and write me once more and i think i will never cease to write again and give my homage to jane carlyle ever yours rw emerson clii carlyle to emerson chelsea may dear emerson the sight of your handwriting was a real blessing to me after so long an abstinence you shall not know all the sad reflections i have made upon your silence within the last year i never doubted your fidelity of heart your genial deep and friendly recognition of my bits of merits and my bits of sufferings difficulties and obstructions your forgiveness of my faults or in fact that you ever would forget me or cease to think kindly of me but it seemed as if practically old age had come upon the scene here too and as if upon the whole one must make up ones mind to know that all this likewise had fallen silent and could be possessed henceforth only on those new terms alas there goes much over year after year into the regions of the immortals inexpressibly beautiful but also inexpressibly sad i have not many voices to commune with in the world in fact i have properly no voice at all and yours i have often said was the unique among my fellowcreatures from which came full response and discourse of reason the solitude one lives in if one has any spiritual thought at all is very great in these epochs the truth is moreover i bought spectacles to myself about two years ago bad print in candle light having fairly become troublesome to me much may lie in that the buying of your first pair of spectacles i said to an old scotch gentleman is an important epoch like the buying of your first razor yes answered he but not quite so joyful perhaps well well i have heard from you again and you promise to be again constant in writing shall i believe you this time do it and shame the devil i really am persuaded it will do yourself good and to me i know right well and have always known what it will do the gaunt lonesomeness of this midnight hour in the ugly universal snoring hum of the overfilled deepsunk posterity of adam renders an articulate speaker precious indeed watchman what sayest thou then watchman what of the night your glimpses of the huge unmanageable mississippi of the huge ditto model republic have here and there something of the epic in them ganz nach meinem sinne i see you do not dissent from me in regard to that latter enormous phenomenon except on the outer surface and in the way of peaceably instead of unpeaceably accepting the same alas all the world is a republic of the mediocrities and always was you may see what its universal suffrage is and has been by looking into all the ugly mudocean with some old weathercocks atop that now is the world wholly if we think of it is the exact stamp of men wholly and of the sincerest hearttongueandhand suffrage they could give about it poor devils i was much struck with plato last year and his notions about democracy mere latterday pamphlet saxa et faces read faeces if you like refined into empyrean radiance and lightning of the gods i for my own part perceive the use of all this too the inevitability of all this but perceive it at the present height it has attained to be disastrous withal to be horrible and even damnable that judas iscariot should come and slap jesus christ on the shoulder in a familiar manner that all heavenliest nobleness should be flung out into the muddy streets there to jostle elbows with all thickestskinned denizens of chaos and get itself at every turn trampled into the gutters and annihilated alas the reverse of all this was is and ever will be the strenuous effort and most solemn heartpurpose of every good citizen in every country of the world and will reappear conspicuously as such in new england and in old first of all as i calculate when once this malodorous melancholy uncle tommery is got all well put by which will take some time yet i think and so we will leave it i went to germany last autumn not seeking anything very definite rather merely flying from certain troops of carpenters painters bricklayers c c who had made a lodgment in this poor house and have not even yet got their incalculable riot quite concluded sorrow on them and no return to these poor premises of mine till i have quite left in germany i found but little and suffered from six weeks of sleeplessness in german beds c c a great deal indeed i seem to myself never yet to have quite recovered the rhine which i honestly ascended from rotterdam to frankfort was as i now find my chief conquest the beautifulest river in the earth i do believe and my first idea of a worldriver it is many fathoms deep broader twice over than the thames here at high water and rolls along mirrorsmooth except that in looking close you will find ten thousand little eddies in it voiceless swift with trim banks through the heart of europe and of the middle ages wedded to the present age such an image of calm power to say nothing of its other properties i find i had never seen before the old cities too are a little beautiful to me in spite of my state of nerves honest kindly people too but sadly short of our and your despatchofbusiness talents a really painful defect in the long run i was on two of fritzs battlefields moreover lobositz in bohemia and kunersdorf by frankfurt on the oder but did not especially in the latter case make much of that schillers deathchamber goethes sad courtenvironment above all luthers little room in the wartburg i believe i actually had tears in my eyes there and kissed the old oaktable being in a very flurried state of nerves my belief was that under the canopy there was not at present so holy a spot as that same of human souls i found none specially beautiful to me at all at all such my sad fate of learned professors i saw little and that little was more than enough tieck at berlin an old man lame on a sofa i did love and do he is an exception could i have seen much of him but on the whole universal puseyism seemed to me the humor of german especially of berlin thinkers and i had some quite portentous specimens of that kind unconscious specimens of four hundred quack power truly and really the prussian soldiers with their intelligent silence with the touches of effective spartanism i saw or fancied in them were the class of people that pleased me best but see my sheet is out i am still reading reading most nightmare books about fritz but as to writing ach gott never never clough is coming home i hope write soon if you be not enchanted yours ever t carlyle cliia emerson to carlyle concord august my dear carlyle your kindest letter whose date i dare not count back to perhaps it was may i have just read again to be deeply touched by its noble tragic tone of goodness to me not without new wonder at my perversity and terror at what both may be aforging to strike me my slowness to write is a distemper that reaches all my correspondence and not that with you only though the circumstance is not worth stating because if i ceased to write to all the rest there would yet be good reason for writing to you i believe the reason of this recusancy is the fear of disgusting my friends as with a book open always at the same page for i have some experiences that my interest in thoughts and to an end perhaps only of new thoughts and thinking outlasts that of all my reasonable neighbors and offends no doubt by unhealthy pertinacity but though rebuked by a daily reduction to an absurd solitude and by a score of disappointments with intellectual people and in the face of a special hell provided for me in the swedenborg universe i am yet confirmed in my madness by the scope and satisfaction i find in a conversation once or twice in five years if so often and so we find or pick what we call our proper path though it be only from stone to stone or from island to island in a very rude stilted and violent fashion with such solitariness and frigidities you may judge i was glad to see clough here with whom i had established some kind of robust workingfriendship and who had some great permanent values for me had he not taken me by surprise and fled in a night i should have done what i could to block his way i am too sure he will not return the first months comprise all the shocks of disappointment that are likely to disgust a newcomer the sphere of opportunity opens slowly but to a man of his abilities and culture rare enough here with the sureness of chemistry the giraffe entering paris wore the label eh bien messieurs il ny a quune bete de plus and oxonians are cheap in london but here the eternal economy of sending things where they are wanted makes a commanding claim do not suffer him to relapse into london he had made himself already cordially welcome to many good people and would have soon made his own place he had just established his valise at my house and was to come the gay deceiver once a fortnight for his sunday and his individualities and his nationalities are alike valuable to me i beseech you not to commend his unheroic retreat i have lately made one or two drafts on your goodness which i hate to do both because you meet them so generously and because you never give me an opportunity of revenge and mainly in the case of miss bacon who has a private history that entitles her to high respect and who could be helped only by facilitating her shakespeare studies in which she has the faith and ardor of a discoverer bancroft was to have given her letters to hallam but gave one to sir h ellis everett i believe gave her one to mr grote and when i told her what i remembered hearing of spedding she was eager to see him which access i knew not how to secure except through you she wrote me that she prospers in all things and had just received at once a summons to meet spedding at your house but do not fancy that i send any one to you heedlessly for i value your time at its rate to nations and refuse many more letters than i give i shall not send you any more people without good reason your visit to germany will stand you in stead when the annoyances of the journey are forgotten and in spite of your disclaimers i am preparing to read your history of frederic you are an inveterate european and rightfully stand for your polity and antiquities and culture and i have long since forborne to importune you with america as if it were a humorous repetition of johnsons visit to scotland and yet since thackerays adventure i have often thought how you would bear the pains and penalties and have painted out your march triumphal i was at new york lately for a few days and fell into some traces of thackeray who has made a good mark in this country by a certain manly blurting out of his opinion in various companies where so much honesty was rare and useful i am sorry never once to have been in the same town with him whilst he was here i hope to see him if he comes again new york would interest you as i am told it did him you both less and more the society there is at least selfpleased and its own it has a contempt of boston and a very modest opinion of london there is already all the play and fury that belong to great wealth a new fortune drops into the city every day no end is to palaces none to diamonds none to dinners and suppers all spanish america discovers that only in the u states of all the continent is safe investment and money gravitates therefore to new york the southern naphtha too comes in as an ingredient and lubricates manners and tastes to that degree that boston is hated for stiffness and excellence in luxury is rapidly attained of course dining dancing equipaging etc are the exclusive beatitudes and thackeray will not cure us of this distemper have you a physician that can are you a physician and will you come if you will come cities will go out to meet you and now i see i have so much to say to you that i ought to write once a month and i must begin at this point again incontinently ever yours rw emerson cliii carlyle to emerson chelsea london september dear emerson your letter came ten days ago very kind and however late surely right welcome you ought to stir yourself up a little and actually begin to speak to me again if we are getting old that is no reason why we should fall silent and entirely abstruse to one another alas i do not find as i grow older that the number of articulatespeaking human souls increases around me in proportion to the inarticulate and palavering species i am often abundantly solitary in heart and regret the old days when we used to speak oftener together i have not quitted town this year at all have resisted calls to scotland both of a gay and a sad description for the ashburtons are gone to john of groats house or the scottish thule to rusticate and hunt and alas in poor old annandale a tragedy seems preparing for me and the thing i have dreaded all my days is perhaps now drawing nigh ah me i felt so utterly broken and disgusted with the jangle of last years locomotion i judged it would be better to sit obstinately still and let my thoughts settle into sediment and into clearness as it might be and so in spite of great and peculiar noises moreover here i am and remain london is not a bad place at all in these months with its long clean streets green parks and nobody in them or nobody one has ever seen before out of la trappe which does not suit a protestant man there is perhaps no place where one can be so perfectly alone i might study even but as i said there are noises going on a last desperate spasmodic effort of building a new topstory to the house out of which is to be made one spacious room so they call it though it is under twenty feet square where there shall be air ad libitum light from the sky and no sound not even that of the cremorne cannons shall find access to me any more such is the prophecy may the gods grant it we shall see now in about a month then adieu to mortartubs to all eternity i endure the thing meanwhile as well as i can might run to a certain rural retreat near by if i liked at any time but do not yet the worst uproar here is but a trifle to that of german inns and horrible squeaking choking railway trains and one does not go to seek this this is here of its own will and for a purpose seriously i had for twelve years had such a soundproof inaccessible apartment schemed out in my head and last year under a poor helpless builder had finally given it up but chelsea as london generally swelling out as if it were mad grows every year noisier a good builder turned up and with a last paroxysm of enthusiasm i set him to my notion is he will succeed in which case it will be a great possession to me for the rest of my life alas this is not the kind of silence i could have coveted and could once get with green fields and clear skies to accompany it but one must take such as can be had and thank the gods even so my friend in the course of about a year of that garret sanctuary i hope to have swept away much litter from my existence in fact i am already by dint of mere obstinate quiescence in such circumstances as there are intrinsically growing fairly sounder in nerves what a business a poor human being has with those nerves of his with that crazy clay tabernacle of his enough enough there will be all eternity to rest in as arnauld said why in such a fuss little sir you apologize for sending people to me o you of little faith never dream of such a thing nay whom did you send the cincinnati lecturer i had provided for with owen they would have been glad to hear him on the cedar forests on the pigs making rattlesnakes into bacon and the general adipocere question under any form at the albemarle street rooms and he never came to hand as for miss bacon we find her with her modest shy dignity with her solid character and strange enterprise a real acquisition and hope we shall now see more of her now that she has come nearer to us to lodge i have not in my life seen anything so tragically quixotic as her shakespeare enterprise alas alas there can be nothing but sorrow toil and utter disappointment in it for her i do cheerfully what i can which is far more than she asks of me for i have not seen a prouder silent soul but there is not the least possibility of truth in the notion she has taken up and the hope of ever proving it or finding the least document that countenances it is equal to that of vanquishing the windmills by stroke of lance i am often truly sorry about the poor lady but she troubles nobody with her difficulties with her theories she must try the matter to the end and charitable souls must further her so far mr om mitchell the astronomer clough is settled in his office gets familiarized to it rapidly he says and seems to be doing well i see little of him hitherto i did not and will not try to influence him in his choice of countries but i think he is now likely to continue here and here too he may do us some good of america at least of new england i can perceive he has brought away an altogether kindly almost filial impression especially of a certain man who lives in that section of the earth more power to his elbow thackeray has very rarely come athwart me since his return he is a big fellow soul and body of many gifts and qualities particularly in the hogarth line with a dash of sterne superadded of enormous appetite withal and very uncertain and chaotic in all points except his outer breeding which is fixed enough and perfect according to the modern english style i rather dread explosions in his history a big fierce weeping hungry man not a strong one ay de mi but i must end i must end your letter awakened in me while reading it one mad notion i said to myself well if i live to finish this frederic impossibility or even to fling it fairly into the fire why should not i go in my old days and see concord yankeeland and that man again after all adieu dear friend all good be with you and yours always t carlyle cliv emerson to carlyle concord march my dear carlyle the sight of mr samuel laurence the day before yesterday in new york and of your head among his sketches set me on thinking which had some pain where should be only cheer for mr laurence i hailed his arrival on every account i wish to see a good man whom you prize and i like to have good englishmen come to america which of all countries after their own has the best claim to them he promises to come and see me and has begun most propitiously in new york for you i have too much constitutional regard and not to feel remorse for my shortcomings and slowcomings and i remember the maxim which the french stole from our indians and it was worth stealing let not the grass grow on the path of friendship ah my brave giant you can never understand the silence and forbearances of such as are not giants to those to whom we owe affection let us be dumb until we are strong though we should never be strong i hate mumped and measled lovers i hate cramp in all men most in myself and yet i should have been pushed to write without samuel laurence for i lately looked into jesuitism a latterday pamphlet and found why you like those papers so well i think you have cleared your skirts it is a pretty good minority of one enunciating with brilliant malice what shall be the universal opinion of the next edition of mankind and the sanity was so manifest that i felt that the overgods had cleared their skirts also to this generation in not leaving themselves without witness though without this single voice perhaps i should not acquit them also i pardon the world that reads the book as though it read it not when i see your inveterated humors it required courage and required conditions that feuilletonists are not the persons to name or qualify this writing rabelais in and to do this alone you must even pitch your tune to suit yourself we must let arctic navigators and deepsea divers wear what astonishing coats and eat what meats wheat or whale they like without criticism i read further sidewise and backwards in these pamphlets without exhausting them i have not ceased to think of the great warm heart that sends them forth and which i with others sometimes tag with satire and with not being warm enough for this poor world i too though i know its meltings tomeward then i learned that the newspapers had announced the death of your mother which i heard of casually on the rock river illinois and that you and your brother john had been with her in scotland i remembered what you had once and again said of her to me and your apprehensions of the event which has come i can well believe you were grieved the best son is not enough a son my mother died in my house in november who had lived with me all my life and kept her heart and mind clear and her own until the end it is very necessary that we should have mothers we that read and write to keep us from becoming paper i had found that age did not make that she should die without causing me pain in my journeying lately when i think of home the heart is taken out miss bacon wrote me in joyful fulness of the cordial kindness and aid she had found at your hands and at your wifes and i have never thanked you and much less acknowledged her copious letter copious with desired details clough too wrote about you and i have not written to him since his return to england you will see how total is my ossification meantime i have nothing to tell you that can explain this mild palsy i worked for a time on my english notes with a view of printing but was forced to leave them to go read some lectures in philadelphia and some western towns i went out northwest to great countries which i had not visited before rode one day fault of broken railroads in a sleigh sixtyfive miles through the snow by lake michigan seeing how prairies and oakopenings look in winter to reach milwaukee the world there was done up in large lots as a settler told me the farmer as he is now a colonist and has drawn from his local necessities great doses of energy is interesting and makes the heroic age for wisconsin he lives on venison and quails i was made much of as the only man of the pen within five hundred miles and by rarity worth more than venison and quails greeley of the new york tribune is the right spiritual father of all this region he prints and disperses one hundred and ten thousand newspapers in one day multitudes of them in these very parts he had preceded me by a few days and people had flocked together coming thirty and forty miles to hear him speak as was right for he does all their thinking and theory for them for two dollars a year other than colonists i saw no man there are no singing birds in the prairie i truly heard all the life of the land and water had distilled no thought younger and better i had no doubt been tormented to read and speak their sense for them now i only gazed at them and their boundless land one good word closed your letter in september which ought to have had an instant reply namely that you might come westward when frederic was disposed of speed frederic then for all reasons and for this america is growing furiously town and state new kansas new nebraska looming up in these days vicious politicians seething a wretched destiny for them already at washington the politicians shall be sodden the states escape please god the fight of slave and freeman drawing nearer the question is sharply whether slavery or whether freedom shall be abolished come and see wealth which is always interesting for from wealth power refuses to be divorced is on a new scale californian quartz mountains dumped down in new york to be repiled architecturally along shore from canada to cuba and thence west to california again john bull interests you at home and is all your subject come and see the jonathanization of john what you scorn all this well then come and see a few good people impossible to be seen on any other shore who heartily and always greet you there is a very serious welcome for you here and i too shall wake from sleep my wife entreats that an invitation shall go from her to you faithfully yours rw emerson clv carlyle to emerson chelsea april dear emerson it was a morning not like any other which lay round it a morning to be marked white that one about a week ago when your letter came to me a word from you yet again after so long a silence on the whole i perceive you will not utterly give up answering me but will rouse yourself now and then to a word of human brotherhood on my behalf so long as we both continue in this planet and i declare the heavens will reward you and as to me i will be thankful for what i get and submissive to delays and to all things all things are good compared with flat want in that respect it remains true and will remain what i have often told you that properly there is no voice in this world which is completely human to me which fully understands all i say and with clear sympathy and sense answers to me but your voice only that is a curious fact and not quite a joyful one to me the solitude the silence of my poor soul in the centre of this roaring whirlpool called universe is great always and sometimes strange and almost awful i have two million talking bipeds without feathers close at my elbow too and of these it is often hard for me to say whether the socalled wise or the almost professedly foolish are the more inexpressibly unproductive to me silence silence i often say to myself be silent thou poor fool and prepare for that divine silence which is now not far on the whole write to me whenever you can and be not weary of welldoing i have had sad things to do and see since i wrote to you the loss of my dear and good old mother which could not be spared me forever has come more like a kind of total bankruptcy upon me than might have been expected considering her age and mine oh those last two days that last christmas sunday she was a true pious brave and noble mother to me and it is now all over and the past has all become pale and sad and sacred and the alldevouring potency of death what we call death has never looked so strange cruel and unspeakable to me nay not cruel altogether let me say huge profound unspeakable that is the word you too have lost your good old mother who stayed with you like mine clear to the last alas alas it is the oldest law of nature and it comes on every one of us with a strange originality as if it had never happened before forward however and no more lamenting no more than cannot be helped paradise is under the shadow of our swords said the emir forward i make no way in my prussian history i bore and dig toilsomely through the unutterablest mass of dead rubbish which is not even english which is german and inhuman and hardly from ten tons of learned inanity is there to be riddled one old rusty nail for i have been back as far as pytheas who first of speaking creatures beheld the teutonic countries and have questioned all manner of extinct german shadows who answer nothing but mumblings and on the whole fritz himself is not sufficiently divine to me far from it and i am getting old and heavy of heart and in short it oftenest seems to me i shall never write any word about that matter and have again fairly got into the element of the impossible very well could i help it i can at least be honestly silent and bear my indigence with dignity as you once said the insuperable difficulty of frederic is that he the genuine little ray of veritable and eternal that was in him lay imbedded in the putrid eighteenth century such an ocean of sordid nothingness shams and scandalous hypocrisies as never weltered in the world before and that in everything i can find yet written or recorded of him he still to all intents and purposes most tragically lies there and ought not to lie there if any use is ever to be had of him or at least of writing about him for as to him he with his work is safe enough to us far elsewhere pity me pity me i know not on what hand to turn and have such a chaos filling all my earth and heaven as was seldom seen in british or foreign literature add to which the sacred entity literature itself is not growing more venerable to me but less and ever less good heavens i feel often as if there were no madder set of bladders tumbling on the billows of the general bedlam at this moment than even the literary ones dear at twopence a gross i should say unless one could annihilate them by purchase on those easy terms but do not tell this in gath let it be a sad family secret i smile with a kind of grave joy over your american speculations and wild dashing portraitures of things as they are with you and recognize well under your light caricature the outlines of a right true picture which has often made me sad and grim in late years yes i consider that the battle of freedom and slavery is very far from ended and that the fate of poor freedom in the quarrel is very questionable indeed alas there is but one slavery as i wrote somewhere and that i think is mounting towards a height which may bring strokes to bear upon it again meanwhile patience for us there is nothing else appointed tell me however what has become of your book on england we shall really be obliged to you for that a piece of it went through all the newspapers some years ago which was really unique for its quaint kindly insight humor and other qualities like an etching by hollar or durer amid the continents of vile smearing which are called pictures at present come on come on give us the book and dont loiter miss bacon has fled away to st albans the great bacons place five or six months ago and is there working out her shakespeare problem from the depths of her own mind disdainful apparently or desperate and careless of all evidence from museums or archives i have not had an answer from her since before christmas and have now lost her address poor lady i sometimes silently wish she were safe home again for truly there can no madder enterprise than her present one be well figured adieu my friend i must stop short here write soon if you have any charity good be with you ever t carlyle clvi emerson to carlyle concord april my dear friend on this delicious spring day i will obey the beautiful voices of the winds long disobeyed and address you nor cloud the hour by looking at the letters in my drawer to know if a twelvemonth has been allowed to elapse since this tardy writing was due mr everett sent me one day a letter he had received from you containing a kind message to me which gave me pleasure and pain i returned the letter with thanks and with promises i would sin no more instantly i was whisked by the stormy wing of fate out of my chain and whirled like a dry leaf through the state of new york now at home again i read english newspapers with all the world and claim an imaginary privilege over my compatriots that i revolve therein my friends large part ward said to me yesterday that carlyles star was daily rising for c had said years ago when all men thought him mad that which the rest of mortals including the times newspaper have at last got near enough to see with eyes and therefore to believe and one day in philadelphia you should have heard the wise young philip randolph defend you against objections of mine but when i have such testimony i say to myself the highseeing austerely exigent friend whom i elected and who elected me twenty years and more ago finds me heavy and silent when all the world elects and loves him yet i have not changed i have the same pride in his genius the same sympathy with the genius that governs his the old love with the old limitations though love and limitation be all untold and i see well what a piece of providence he is how material he is to the times which must always have a solo soprano to balance the roar of the orchestra the solo sings the theme the orchestra roars antagonistically but follows and have i not put him into my chapter of english spiritual tendencies with all thankfulness to the eternal creator though the chapter lie unborn in a trunk t is fine for us to excuse ourselves and patch with promises we shall do as before and science is a fatalist i follow i find the fortunes of my country in my privatest ways an american is pioneer and man of all work and reads up his newspaper on saturday night as farmers and foresters do we admire the greek and mean to give our boys the grand habit but we only sketch what they may do no leisure except for the strong the nimble have none i ought to tell you what i do or i ought to have to tell you what i have done but what can i the same concession to the levity of the times the noise of america comes again i have even run on wrong topics for my parsimonious muse and waste my time from my true studies england i see as a roaring volcano of fate which threatens to roast or smother the poor literary plinys that come too near for mere purpose of reporting i have even fancied you did me a harm by the valued gift of antony wood which and the like of which i take a lotophagous pleasure in eating yet this is measuring after appearance measuring on hours and days the true measure is quite other for life takes its color and quality not from the days but the dawns the lucid intervals are like drowning mens moments equivalent to the foregoing years besides nature uses us we live but little for ourselves a good deal for our children and strangers each man is one more lump of clay to hold the world together it is in the power of the spirit meantime to make him rich reprisals which he confides will somewhere be done ah my friend you have better things to send me word of than these musings of indolence is frederic recreated is frederic the great forget my shortcomings and write to me miss bacon sends me word again and again of your goodness against hope and sight she must be making a remarkable book i have a letter from her a few days ago written in perfect assurance of success kindest remembrances to your wife and to your brother yours faithfully rw emerson clvii carlyle to emerson chelsea may dear emerson last sunday clough was here and we were speaking about you much to your discredit you need not doubt and how stingy in the way of letters you were grown when next morning your letter itself made its appearance thanks thanks you know not in the least i perceive nor can be made to understand at all how indispensable your letters are to me how you are and have for a long time been the one of all the sons of adam who i felt completely understood what i was saying and answered with a truly human voice inexpressibly consolatory to a poor man in his lonesome pilgrimage towards the evening of the day so many voices are not human but more or less bovine porcine canine and ones soul dies away in sorrow in the sound of them and is reduced to a dialogue with the silences which is of a very abstruse nature well whether you write to me or not i reserve to myself the privilege of writing to you so long as we both continue in this world as the beneficent presences vanish from me one after the other those that remain are the more precious and i will not part with them not with the chief of them beyond all this last year has been a grimmer lonelier one with me than any i can recollect for a long time i did not go to the country at all in summer or winter refused even my christmas at the grange with the ashburtons it was too sad an anniversary for me i have sat here in my garret wriggling and wrestling on the worst terms with a task that i cannot do that generally seems to me not worth doing and yet must be done these are truly the terms i never had such a business in my life before frederick himself is a pretty little man to me veracious courageous invincible in his small sphere but he does not rise into the empyrean regions or kindle my heart round him at all and his history upon which there are wagonloads of dull bad books is the most dislocated unmanageably incoherent altogether dusty barren and beggarly production of the modern muses as given hitherto no man of genius ever saw him with eyes except twice mirabeau for half an hour each time and the wretched books have no indexes no precision of detail and i am far away from berlin and the seat of information and in brief shall be beaten miserably with this unwise enterprise in my old days and in fine will consent to be so and get through it if i can before i die this of obstinacy is the one quality i still show all my other qualities hope among them often seem to have pretty much taken leave of me but it is necessary to hold by this last pray for me i will complain no more at present general washington gained the freedom of america chiefly by this respectable quality i talk of nor can a history of frederick be written in chelsea in the year except as against hope and by planting yourself upon it in an extremely dogged manner we are all woolgathering here with wide eyes and astonished minds at a singular rate since you heard last from me balaklava i can perceive is likely to be a substantive in the english language henceforth it in truth expresses compendiously what an earnest mind will experience everywhere in english life if his soul rise at all above cotton and scrip a man has to pronounce it all a balaklava these many years a balaklava now yielding under the pressure of rains and unexpected transit of heavy wagons champing itself down into mere mudgulfs towards the bottomless pool if some flooring be not found to me it is not intrinsically a new phenomenon only an extremely hideous one altum silentium what else can i reply to it at present the turk war undertaken under pressure of the mere mobility seemed to me an enterprise worthy of bedlam from the first and this method of carrying it on without any general or with a mere sash and cockedhat for one is of the same block of stuff ach gott is not anarchy and parliamentary eloquence instead of work continued for half a century everywhere a beautiful piece of business we are in alliance with louis napoleon a gentleman who has shown only housebreaker qualities hitherto and is required now to show heroic ones or go to the devil and under marechal saintarnaud who was once a dancingmaster in this city and continued a thief in all cities a commander of the playactorpirate description resembling a general as alexander dumas does dante alighieri we have got into a very strange problem indeed but there is something almost grand in the stubborn thickside patience and persistence of this english people and i do not question but they will work themselves through in one fashion or another nay probably get a great deal of benefit out of this astonishing slap on the nose to their selfcomplacency before all the world they have not done yet i calculate by any manner of means they are however admonished in an ignominious and convincing manner amid the laughter of nations that they are altogether on the wrong road this great while two hundred years as i have been calculating often and i shudder to think of the plunging and struggle they will have to get into the approximately right one again pray for them also poor stupid overfed heavyladen souls before my paper quite end i must in my own name and that of a select company of others inquire rigorously of rwe why he does not give us that little book on england he has promised so long i am very serious in saying i myself want much to see it and that i can see no reason why we all should not without delay bring it out i say and print it tale quale you will never get it in the least like what you wish it clearly no but i venture to warrant it is good enough far too good for the readers that are to get it such a pack of blockheads and disloyal and bewildered unfortunates who know not their right hand from their left as fill me with astonishment and are more and more forfeiting all respect from me publish the book i say let us have it and so have done adieu my dear friend for this time i had a thousand things more to write but have wasted my sheet and must end i will take another before long whatever you do in my lonely thoughts you are never long absent valete all of you at concord t carlyle clviii emerson to carlyle concord may dear carlyle there is no escape from the forces of time and life and we do not write letters to the gods or to our friends but only to attorneys landlords and tenants but the planes and platforms on which all stand remain the same and we are ever expecting the descent of the heavens which is to put us into familiarity with the first named when i ceased to write to you for a long time i said to myself if anything really good should happen here any stroke of good sense or virtue in our politics or of great sense in a book i will send it on the instant to the formidable man but i will not repeat to him every month that there are no news thank me for my resolution and for keeping it through the long night one book last summer came out in new york a nondescript monster which yet had terrible eyes and buffalo strength and was indisputably american which i thought to send you but the book throve so badly with the few to whom i showed it and wanted good morals so much that i never did yet i believe now again i shall it is called leaves of grass was written and printed by a journeyman printer in brooklyn new york named walter whitman and after you have looked into it if you think as you may that it is only an auctioneers inventory of a warehouse you can light your pipe with it by tomorrows steamer goes mrs to liverpool and to switzerland and germany by the advice of physicians and i cannot let her go without praying you to drop your pen and shut up german history for an hour and extend your walk to her chambers wherever they may be theres a piece of republicanism for you to see and hear that person was ten or fifteen years ago the loveliest of women and her speech and manners may still give you some report of the same she has always lived with good people and in her position is a centre of what is called good society wherein her large heart makes a certain glory and refinement she is one of natures ladies and when i hear her tell i know not what stories of her friends or her children or her pensioners i find a pathetic eloquence which i know not where to match but i suppose you shall never hear it every american is a little displaced in london and no doubt her company has grown to her her husband is a banker connected in business with your and is a man of elegant genius and tastes and his house is a resort for fine people thorwaldsen distinguished mrs in rome formerly by his attentions powers the sculptor made an admirable bust of her clough and thackeray will tell you of her jenny lind like the rest was captivated by her and was married at her house is not henry james in london he knows her well if tennyson comes to london whilst she is there he should see her for his lays of good women now please to read these things to the wise and kind ears of jane carlyle and ask her if i have done wrong in giving my friend a letter to her i could not ask more than that each of those ladies might appear to the other what each has appeared to me i saw thackeray in the winter and he said he would come and see me here in april or may but he is still i believe in the south and west do not believe me for my reticency less hungry for letters i grieve at the want and loss and am about writing again that i may hear from you ever affectionately yours rw emerson clix carlyle to emerson chelsea july dear emerson welcome was your letter to me after the long interval as welcome as any human letter could now well be these many months and years i have been sunk in what disastrous vortexes of foreign wreck you know till i am fallen sick and almost brokenhearted and my life if it were not this one interest of doing a problem which i see to be impossible and of smallish value if found doable is burdensome and without meaning to me it is so rarely i hear the voice of a magnanimous brother man addressing any word to me ninetynine hundredths of the letters i get are impertinent clutchings of me by the button concerning which the one business is how to get handsomely loose again what to say that shall soonest end the intrusion if saying nothing will not be the best way which last i often in my sorrow have recourse to at what ever known risks we must pay our tribute to time ah yes yes and yet i will believe so long as we continue together in this sphere of things there will always be a potential letter coming out of new england for me and the world not fallen irretrievably dumb the best is i am about going into scotland in two days into deep solitude for a couple of months beside the solway sea i absolutely need to have the dust blown out of me and my mad nerves rested there is nothing else quite gone wrong this unblest life of frederick is now actually to get along into the printers hand a good book being impossible upon it there shall a bad one be done and ones poor existence rid of it for which great object two months of voluntary torpor are considered the fair preliminary in another years time if the fates allow me to live i expect to have got a great deal of rubbish swept into chaos again unlucky it should ever have been dug up much of it your mrs should have had our best welcome for the sake of him who sent her had there been nothing more but the lady never showed face at all nor could i for a long time get any trace and then it was a most faint and distant one as if by double reflex of her whereabout too distant too difficult for me who do not make a call once in the six months lately i did mean to go in quest never had an address but had not yet rallied for the enterprise when mrs herself wrote that she had been unwell that she was going directly for paris and would see us on her return so be it pray only i may not be absent next i have not seen or distinctly heard of miss bacon for a year and half past i often ask myself what has become of that poor lady and wish i knew of her being safe among her friends again i have even lost the address which at any rate was probably not a lasting one perhaps i could find it by the eye but it is five miles away and my nonplusultra for years past is not above half that distance heigho my time is all up and more and chaos come again is lying round me in the shape of packing in a thousand shapes browning is coming tonight to take leave do you know browning at all he is abstruse but worth knowing and what of the discourse on england by a certain man shame we always hear of it again as out and it continues obstinately in adieu my friend ever yours t carlyle clx carlyle to emerson the gill cummertrees annan nb august dear emerson your letter alighted here yesterday like a winged mercury bringing airs from heaven in a sense along with his news i understand very well your indisposition to write we must conform to it as to the law of chronos oldest of the gods but i will murmur always it is such a pity as of almost no other man you are citizen of a republic and perhaps fancy yourself republican in an eminent degree nevertheless i have remarked there is no man of whom i am so certain always to get something kingly and whenever your huge inarticulate america gets settled into kingdoms of the new model fit for these ages which are all upon the moult just now and dreadfully like going to the devil in the interim then will america and all nations through her owe the man emerson a debt far greater than either they or he are in the least aware of at present that i consider for myself to be an ascertained fact for which i myself at least am thankful and have long been it is missing now it pleases me much to know that this english book so long twinkling in our expectations and always drawn back again is at last verily to appear i wish i could get hold of my copy there is no book that would suit me better just now but we must wait for four weeks till we get back to chelsea unless i call find some trusty hand to extract it from the rubbish that will have accumulated there and forward it by post you speak as if there were something dreadful said of my own sacred self in that book courage my friend it will be a most miraculous occurrence to meet with anything said by you that does me ill whether the immediate taste of it be sweet or bitter i will take it with gratitude you may depend nay even with pleasure what perhaps is still more incredible but an old man deluged for half a century with the brutally nonsensical vocables of his fellowcreatures which he grows to regard soon as rain rain of frogs or the like and lifts his umbrella against with indifference such an old gentleman i assure you is grateful for a word that he can recognize perennial sense in as in this case is his sure hope and so be the little book thrice welcome and let all england understand as some choice portion of england will that there has not been a man talking about us these very many years whose words are worth the least attention in comparison post passing i must end in midcourse so much still untouched upon thanks for sampson co and let them go their course upon me if i can see mrs about the end of september or after i shall be right glad but i fear she will have fled before that i am here in my native country riding seabathing living on country diet uttering no word now into the fifth week have had such a retreat as no la trappe hardly could have offered me a retreat without cilices thistlemattresses and with silent devotions if any instead of blockhead spoken ones to the virgin and others there is still an excursion to the highlands ahead which cannot be avoided then home again to peine forte et dure good be with you always dear friend t carlyle clxi carlyle to emerson chelsea december dear emerson i am really grieved to have hurt the feelings of mr phillips a gentleman to whom i on my side had no feelings but those of respect and good will i pray you smooth him down again by all wise methods into at least goodnatured indifference to me he may depend upon it i could not mean to irritate him there lay no gain for me in that nor is there anything of business left now between us it is doubly and trebly evident those stereotype plates are not to him worth their prime cost here still less their prime cost plus any vestige of definite motive for me to concern myself in them whereupon the project falls on its face and vanishes forever with apologies all round for as to that other method that is a game i never thought and never should think of playing at you may also tell him this little biographical fact if you think it will any way help some ten or more years ago i made a similar bargain with a new york house known to you and now i believe extinct or something percent of selling price on the copies printed was to be my return not for four or five hundred pounds money laid out but for various things i did which gratis would by no means have been done in fine it was their own offer made and accepted in due form percent on the copies printed this refers to a proposed arrangement which fell through for the publication in america by messrs phillips and sampson of boston of a complete edition of carlyles works to be printed from the stereotype plates of the english edition then in course of issue by messrs chapman and hall and how many were printed thinks mr phillips i saw one set dreadfully ugly books errors in every page and to this hour i have never heard of any other the amount remains zero net and it would appear there was simply one copy printed the ugly one sent to myself which i instantly despatched again somewhither on second thought perhaps you had better not tell mr phillips this story at least not in this way his integrity i would not even question by insinuation nor need i at the point where we now are i perceive he sees in extraordinary brilliancy of illumination his own side of the bargain and thinks me ignorant of several things which i am well enough informed about in brief make a perfect peace between us o friend and man of peace and let the wampums be all wrapped up and especially the tomahawks entirely buried and the thing end forever to you also i owe apologies but not to you do i pay them knowing from of old what you are to me enough enough i got your book by post in the highlands and had such a day over it as falls rarely to my lot not for seven years and more have i got hold of such a book book by a real man with eyes in his head nobleness wisdom humor and many other things in the heart of him such books do not turn up often in the decade in the century in fact i believe it to be worth all the books ever written by new england upon old franklin might have written such a thing in his own way no other since we do very well with it here and the wise part of us best that chapter on the church is inimitable the bishop asking a troublesome gentleman to take wine you should see the kind of grin it awakens here on our best kind of faces excellent the manner of that and the matter too dreadfully true in every part i do not much seize your idea in regard to literature though i do details of it and will try again glad of that too even in its half state not sorry at any part of it you sceptic on the whole write again and ever again at greater length there lies your only fault to me and yet i know that also is a right noble one and rare in our day o my friend save always for me some corner in your memory i am very lonely in these months and years sunk to the centre of the earth like to be throttled by the pythons and mudgods in my old days but shall get out again too and be a better boy no hurry equals mine and it is in permanence yours ever t carlyle clxii emerson to carlyle concord may my dear carlyle i see no way for you to avoid the americans but to come to america for first or last we are all embarking and all steering straight to your door mr and mrs joseph longworth of cincinnati are going abroad on their travels possibly the name is not quite unknown to you their father nicholas longworth is one of the founders of the city of cincinnati a bigger town than boston where he is a huge land lord and planter and patron of sculptors and painters and his family are most favorably known to all dwellers and strangers in the ohio valley as people who have well used their great wealth his chief merit is to have introduced a systematic culture of the winegrape and wine manufacture by the importing and settlement of german planters in that region and the trade is thriving to the general benefit his son joseph is a wellbred gentleman of literary tastes whose position and good heart make him largely hospitable his wife is a very attractive and excellent woman and they are good friends of mine it seems i have at some former time told her that when she went to england she should see you and they are going abroad soon for the first time if you are in london you must be seen of them but i hailed even this need of taxing once more your often taxed courtesy as a means to break up my long contumacy toyouward please let not the wires be rusted out so that we cannot weld them again and let me feel the subtle fluid streaming strong tell me what is become of frederic for whose appearance i have watched every week for months i am better ready for him since one or two books about voltaire maupertuis and company fell in my way yet that book will not come which i most wish to read namely the culled results the quintessence of private conviction a liber veritatis a few sentences hints of the final moral you drew from so much penetrating inquest into past and present men all writing is necessitated to be exoteric and written to a human should instead of to the terrible is and i say this to you because you are the truest and bravest of writers every writer is a skater who must go partly where he would and partly where the skates carry him or a sailor who can only land where sails can be safely blown the variations to be allowed for in the surveyors compass are nothing like so large as those that must be allowed for in every book and a friendship of old gentlemen who have got rid of many illusions survived their ambition and blushes and passion for euphony and surface harmonies and tenderness for their accidental literary stores but have kept all their curiosity and awe touching the problems of man and fate and the cause of causes a friendship of old gentlemen of this fortune is looking more comely and profitable than anything i have read of love such a dream flatters my incapacities for conversation for we can all play at monosyllables who cannot attempt the gay pictorial panoramic styles so if ever i hear that you have betrayed the first symptom of age that your back is bent a twentieth of an inch from the perpendicular i shall hasten to believe you are shearing your prodigal overgrowths and are calling in your troops to the citadel and i may come in the first steamer to drop in of evenings and hear the central monosyllables be good now again and send me quickly though it be the shortest autograph certificate of the end of this letter is lost clxiii carlyle to emerson chelsea june dear emerson glad indeed i am to hear of you on any terms on any subject for the last eighteen months i have pretty much ceased all human correspondence writing no note that was not in a sense wrung from me my one society the nightmares prussian and other all that while but often and often the image of you and the thoughts of old days between us has risen sad upon me and i have waited to get loose from the nightmares to appeal to you again to edacious time and you most likely in a couple of weeks you would have heard from me again at any rate your friends shall be welcome to me no friend of yours can be other at any time nor in fact did anybody ever sent by you prove other than pleasant in this house so pray no apologies on that small score if only these cincinnati patricians can find me here when they come for i am off to the deepest solitudes discoverable native scotland probably so soon as i can shake the final tag rags of printer people off me surely within three weeks now i say to myself but i shall be back too if all prosper and your longworths will be back and madam will stand to her point i hope that book on friedrich of prussia first half of it two swoln unlovely volumes which treat mainly of his father c and leave him at his accession is just getting out of my hands one packet more of proofs and i have done with it thanks to all the gods no job approaching in ugliness to it was ever cut out for me nor had i any motive to go on except the sad negative one shall we be beaten in our old days then but it has thoroughly humbled me trampled me down into the mud there to wrestle with the accumulated stupidities of mankind german english french and other for all have borne a hand in these sad centuries and here i emerge at last not killed but almost as good seek not to look at the book nay in fact it is not to be published till september so the man of affairs settles with me yesterday owing to the political c to the season c my only stipulation was that in ten days i should be utterly out of it not to hear of it again till the day of judgment and if possible not even then in fact it is a bad book poor misshapen feeble nearly worthless thanks to past generations and to me and my one excuse is i could not make it better all the world having played such a game with it well well how true is that you say about the skater and the rider too depending on his vehicles on his roads on his et ceteras dismally true have i a thousand times felt it in these late operations never in any so much and in short the business of writing has altogether become contemptible to me and i am become confirmed in the notion that nobody ought to write unless sheer fate force him to do it and then he ought if not of the mountebank genus to beg to be shot rather that is deliberately my opinion or far nearer it than you will believe once or twice i caught some tone of you in some american magazine utterances highly noteworthy to me in a sense the only thing that is speech at all among my fellowcreatures in this time for the years that remain i suppose we must continue to grumble out some occasional utterance of that kind what can we do at this late stage but in the real model republic it would have been different with two good boys of this kind though shattered and trampled down to an immense degree i do not think any bones are broken yet though age truly is here and you may engage your berth in the steamer whenever you like in a few months i expect to be sensibly improved but my poor wife suffers sadly the last two winters and i am much distressed by that item of our affairs adieu dear emerson i have lost many things let me not lose you till i must in some way yours ever t carlyle ps if you read the newspapers which i carefully abstain from doing they will babble to you about dickenss separation from wife c c fact of separation i believe is true but all the rest is mere lies and nonsense no crime or misdemeanor specifiable on either side unhappy together these good many years past and they at length end it sulzer said men are by nature good ach mein lieber sulzer er kennt nicht diese verdammte race ejaculated fritz at hearing such an axiom clxiii carlyle to emerson chelsea london april dear emerson long months ago there was sent off for you a copy of friedrich of prussia two big red volumes for which chapman the publisher had found some safe swift vehicle and now i have reason to fear they are still loitering somewhere or at least have long loitered sorrow on them this is to say if you have not yet got them address a line to saml f flower esq librarian of antiquarian society worcester mass forty miles from you they say and that will at once bring them in the devils name i never in my life was so near choked swimming in this mother of dead dogs and a long spell of it still ahead i profoundly pity myself if no one else does you shall hear of me again if i survive but really that is getting beyond a joke with me and i ought to hold my peace even to you and swim what i can your little touch of human speech on burns was charming had got into the papers here and been clipt out by me before your copy came and has gone far and wide since newberg was to give it me in german from the allgemeine zeitung but lost the leaf adieu my friend very dear to me tho dumb t carlyle in such haste as seldom was emersons fine speech was made at the celebration of the burns centenary boston january see his miscellanies works vol xi p the preceding letter was discovered in in a little package of letters put aside by mr emerson and marked autographs clxiv emerson to carlyle concord may dear carlyle some three weeks ago came to me a note from mr haven of worcester announcing the arrival there of king friedrich and after a fortnight the good book came to my door a week later your letter arrived i was heartily glad to get the crimson book itself i had looked for it with the first ships as it came not i had made up my mind to that hap also it was quite fair i had disentitled myself he the true friend had every right to punish me for my sluggish contumacy backsliding too after penitence so i read with resignation our blue american reprint and i enclose to you a leaf from my journal at the time which leaf i read afterwards in one of my lectures at the music hall in boston but the book came from the man himself he did not punish me he is loyal but royal as well and i have always noted has a whim for dealing en grand monarque the book came with its irresistible inscription so that i am all tenderness and all but tears the book too is sovereignly written i think you the true inventor of the stereoscope as having exhibited that art in style long before we had heard of it in drawing this letter and the extract from the diary are printed from a copy of the original supplied to me by the kindness of mr alexander ireland who first printed a portion of the letter in his ralph waldo emerson a biographical sketch london one or two words missing in the copy are inserted from the rough draft which as usual varies in minor points from the letter as sent the letter came also every child of mine knows from far that handwriting and brings it home with speed i read without alarm the pathetical hints of your sad plight in the german labyrinth i know too well what invitations and assurance brought you in there to fear any lack of guides to bring you out more presence of mind and easy change from the microscopic to the telescopic view does not exist i await peacefully your issue from your pretended afflictions what to tell you of my coop and byre ah you are a very poor fellow and must be left with your glory you hug yourself on missing the illusion of children and must be pitied as having one glittering toy the less i am a victim all my days to certain graces of form and behavior and can never come into equilibrium now i am fooled by my own young people and grow old contented the heedless children suddenly take the keenest hold on life and foolish papas cling to the world on their account as never on their own out of sympathy we make believe to value the prizes of their ambition and hope my two girls pupils once or now of agassiz are good healthy apprehensive decided young people who love life my boy divides his time between cicero and cricket knows his boat the birds and walter scott verse and prose through and through and will go to college next year sam ward and i tickled each other the other day in looking over a very good company of young people by finding in the new comers a marked improvement on their parents there i flatter myself i see some emerging of our people from the prison of their politics the insolvency of slavery shows and stares and we shall perhaps live to see that putrid blackvomit extirpated by mere dying and planting i am so glad to find myself speaking once more to you that i mean to persist in the practice be as glad as you have been you and i shall not know each other on this platform as long as we have known a correspondence even of twentyfive years should not be disused unless through some fatal event life is too short and with all our poetry and morals too indigent to allow such sacrifices eyes so old and wary and which have learned to look on so much are gathering an hourly harvest and i cannot spare what on noble terms is offered me with congratulations to jane carlyle on the grandeur of the book yours affectionately rw emerson extract from diary here has come into the country three or four months ago a history of frederick infinitely the wittiest book that ever was written a book that one would think the english people would rise up in mass and thank the author for by cordial acclamation and signify by crowning him with oakleaves their joy that such a head existed among them and sympathizing and muchreading america would make a new treaty or send a minister extraordinary to offer congratulation of honoring delight to england in acknowledgment of this donation a book holding so many memorable and heroic facts working directly on practice with new heroes things unvoiced before the german plutarch now that we have exhausted the greek and roman and british plutarchs with a range too of thought and wisdom so large and so elastic not so much applying as inosculating to every need and sensibility of man that we do not read a stereotype page rather we see the eyes of the writer looking into ours mark his behavior humming chuckling with undertones and trumpettones and shrugs and longcommanding glances stereoscoping every figure that passes and every hill river road hummock and pebble in the long perspective with its wonderful new system of mnemonics whereby great and insignificant men are ineffaceably ticketed and marked and modeled in memory by what they were had and did and withal a book that is a judgment day for its moral verdict on the men and nations and manners of modern times in the first edition this extract was printed from the original diary it is now printed according to the copy sent abroad and this book makes no noise i have hardly seen a notice of it in any newspaper or journal and you would think there was no such book i am not aware that mr buchanan has sent a special messenger to great cheyne row chelsea or that mr dallas has been instructed to assure mr carlyle of his distinguished consideration but the secret wits and hearts of men take note of it not the less surely they have said nothing lately in praise of the air or of fire or of the blessing of love and yet i suppose they are sensible of these and not less of this book which is like these clxv emerson to carlyle concord april my dear carlyle can booksellers break the seal which the gods do not and put me in communication again with the loyalest of men on the ground of mr wights honest proposal to give you a benefit from his edition i though unwilling allowed him to copy the daguerre of your head the publishers ask also some expression of your good will to their work mr ow wight of new york an upright able editor who had just made arrangements for the publication of a very satisfactory edition of carlyles miscellaneous essays i commend you to the gods who love and uphold you and who do not like to make their great gifts vain but teach us that the best lifeinsurance is a great task i hold you to be one of those to whom all is permitted and who carry the laws in their hand continue to be good to your old friends t is no matter whether they write to you or not if not they save your time when friedrich is once despatched to gods and men there was once some talk that you should come to america you shall have an ovation such and on such sincerity as none have had ever affectionately yours rw emerson i do not know mr wight but he sends his open letter which i fear is already old for me to write in and i will not keep it lest it lose another steamer clxvi carlyle to emerson chelsea london april dear emerson it is a special favor of heaven to me that i hear of you again by this accident and am made to answer a word de profundis it is constantly among the fairest of the few hopes that remain for me on the other side of this stygian abyss of a friedrich should i ever get through it alive that i shall then begin writing to you again who knows if not see you in the body before quite taking wing for i feel always what i have some times written that there is in a sense but one completely human voice to me in the world and that you are it and have been thanks to you whether you speak or not let me say also while i am at it that the few words you sent me about those first two volumes are present with me in the far more frightful darknesses of these last two and indeed are often almost my one encouragement that is a fact and not exaggerated though you think it is i read some criticisms of my wretched book and hundreds of others i in the gross refused to read they were in praise they were in blame but not one of them looked into the eyes of the object and in genuine human fashion responded to its human strivings and recognized it completely right though with generous exaggeration that was well done i can tell you a human voice far out in the waste deeps among the inarticulate seakrakens and obscene monsters loudroaring inexpressibly ugly dooming you as if to eternal solitude by way of wages hath exceeding much refreshment in it as my friend oliver used to say having not one spare moment at present i will answer to you only the whole contents of that letter you in your charity will convey to mr wight what portion belongs to him wight if you have a chance of him is worth knowing a genuine bit of metal too thin and ringing for my tastes hammered in fact upon the yankee anvils but recognizably of steel and with a keen fire edge pray signify to him that he has done a thing agreeable to me and that it will be pleasant if i find it will not hurt him profit to me out of it except to keep his own soul clear and sound to his own sense as it always will be to mine is perfectly indifferent and on the whole i thank him heartily for showing me a chivalrous human brother instead of the usual vulturous malodorous and much avoidable phenomenon in transatlantic bibliopoly this is accurately true and so far as his publisher and he can extract encouragement from this in the face of vested interests which i cannot judge of it is theirs without reserve adieu my friend i have not written so much in the letter way not i think since you last heard of me in my despair it often seems as if i should never write more but be sunk here and perish miserably in the most undoable least worthy most disgusting and heart breaking of all the labors i ever had but perhaps also not not quite in which case yours ever truly at any rate t carlyle no time to reread i suppose you can decipher clxvii carlyle to emerson chelsea january dear emerson the sight of my handwriting will i know be welcome again though i literally do not write the smallest note once in a month or converse with anything but prussian nightmares of a hideous nature and with my horse who is human in comparison and with my poor wife who is altogether human and heroically cheerful to me in her poor weak state i must use the five minutes which have fallen to me today in acknowledgment due by all laws terrestrial and celestial of the last book that has come from you the conduct of life i read it a great while ago mostly in sheets and again read it in the finely printed form i can tell you if you do not already guess with a satisfaction given me by the books of no other living mortal i predicted to your english bookseller a great sale even reckoning it the best of all your books what the sale was or is i nowhere learned but the basis of my prophecy remains like the rocks and will remain indeed except from my brother john i have heard no criticism that had much rationality some of them incredibly irrational if that matter had not altogether become a barking of dogs among us but i always believe there are in the mute state a great number of thinking english souls who can recognize a thinker and a sayer of perennially human type and welcome him as the rarest of miracles in such a spread of knowledge as there now is one english soul of that kind there indubitably is and i certify hereby notarially if you like that such is emphatically his view of the matter you have grown older more pungent piercing i never read from you before such lightninggleams of meaning as are to be found here the finale of all that of illusions falling on us like snowshowers but again of the gods sitting steadfast on their thrones all the while what a fiat lux is there into the deeps of a philosophy which the vulgar has not which hardly three men living have yet dreamt of well done i say and so let that matter rest i am still twelve months or so from the end of my task very uncertain often whether i can even at this snails pace hold out so long in my life i was never worn nearly so low and seem to get weaker monthly courage if i do get through you shall hear of me again yours forever t carlyle clxviii emerson to carlyle concord april my dear carlyle i have to thank you for the cordial note which brought me joy many weeks ago it was noble and welcome in all but its boding account of yourself and your task but i have had experience of your labors and these deplorations i have long since learned to distrust we have settled it in america as i doubt not it is settled in england that frederick is a history which a beneficent providence is not very likely to interrupt and may every kind and tender influence near you and over you keep the best head in england from all harm affectionately rw emerson clxix emerson to carlyle concord december my dear friend long ago as soon as swift steamers could bring the new book across the sea i received the third volume of friedrich with your autograph inscription and read it with joy not a word went to the beloved author for i do not write or think i would wait perhaps for happier days as our president lincoln will not even emancipate slaves until on the heels of a victory or the semblance of such but he waited in vain for his triumph nor dare i in my heavy months expect bright days the book was heartily grateful and square to the authors imperial scale you have lighted the glooms and engineered away the pits whereof you poetically pleased yourself with complaining in your sometime letter to me clean out of it according to the high italian rule and have let sunshine and pure air enfold the scene first i read it honestly through for the history then i pause and speculate on the muse that inspires and the friend that reports it t is sovereignly written above all literature dictating to all mortals what they shall accept as fated and final for their salvation it is mankinds bill of rights and duties the royal proclamation of intellect ascending the throne announcing its good pleasure that hereafter as heretofore and now once for all the world shall be governed by common sense and law of morals or shall go to ruin portions of this and of the following letter of emerson have been printed by mr alexander ireland in his ralph waldo emerson recollections of his visits to england c london but the manner of it the author sitting as demiurgus trotting out his manikins coaxing and bantering them amused with their good performance patting them on the back and rating the naughty dolls when they misbehave and communicating his mind ever in measure just as much as the young public can understand hinting the future when it would be useful recalling now and then illustrative antecedents of the actor impressing the reader that he is in possession of the entire history centrally seen that his investigation has been exhaustive and that he descends too on the petty plot of prussia from higher and cosmical surveys better i like the sound sense and the absolute independence of the tone which may put kings in fear and as the reader shares according to his intelligence the haughty coup doeil of this genius and shares it with delight i recommend to all governors english french austrian and other to double their guards and look carefully to the censorship of the press i find as ever in your books that one man has deserved well of mankind for restoring the scholars profession to its highest use and dignity i find also that you are very wilful and have made a covenant with your eyes that they shall not see anything you do not wish they should but i was heartily glad to read somewhere that your book was nearly finished in the manuscript for i could wish you to sit and taste your fame if that were not contrary to law of olympus my joints ache to think of your rugged labor now that you have conquered to yourself such a huge kingdom among men can you not give yourself breath and chat a little an emeritus in the eternal university and write a gossiping letter to an old american friend or so alas i own that i have no right to say this last i who write never as long before as emerson wrote in his diary carlyle in his new book past and present as everywhere is a continuer of the great line of scholars in the world of horace varro pliny erasmus scaliger milton and well sustains their office in ample credit and honor here we read no books the war is our sole and doleful instructor all our bright young men go into it to be misused and sacrificed hitherto by incapable leaders one lesson they all learn to hate slavery teterrima causa but the issue does not yet appear we must get ourselves morally right nobody can help us t is of no account what england or france may do unless backed by our profligate parties their action would be nugatory and if so backed the worst but even the war is better than the degrading and descending politics that preceded it for decades of years and our legislation has made great strides and if we can stave off that fury of trade which rushes to peace at the cost of replacing the south in the status ante bellum we can with something more of courage leave the problem to another score of years free labor to fight with the beast and see if bales and barrels and baskets cannot find out that they pass more commodiously and surely to their ports through free hands than through barbarians i grieved that the good clough the generous susceptible scholar should die i read over his bothie again full of the wine of youth at oxford i delight in matthew arnolds fine criticism in two little books give affectionate remembrances from me to jane carlyle whom s happiness and accurate reporting restored to me in brightest image always faithfully yours rw emerson clxx carlyle to emerson chelsea march dear emerson this will be delivered to you by the hon lyulph stanley an excellent intelligent young gentleman whom i have known ever since his infancy his father and mother being among my very oldest friends in london lord and lady stanley of alderley not of knowesley but a cadet branch of it whom perhaps you did not meet while here my young friend is coming to look with his own eyes at your huge and hugely travailing country and i think will agree with you better than he does with me in regard to that latest phenomenon at all events he regards emerson as intelligent englishmen all do and you will please me much by giving him your friendliest reception and furtherance which i can certify that he deserves for his own sake not counting mine at all probably he may deliver you the vol iv of frederic he will tell you our news part of which what regards my poor wife is very bad though god be thanked not yet the worst and in some six months he may bring me back some human tidings from concord a place which always inhabits my memory though it is so dumb latterly yours ever t carlyle clxxi emerson to carlyle concord september dear carlyle your friend young stanley brought me your letter now too many days ago it contained heavy news of your household yet such as in these our autumnal days we must await with what firmness we can i hear with pain that your wife whom i have only seen beaming goodness and intelligence has suffered and suffers so severely i recall my first visit to your house when i pronounced you wise and fortunate in relations wherein best men are often neither wise nor fortunate i had already heard rumors of her serious illness send me word i pray you that there is better health and hope for the rest the colonna motto would fit your letter though sad i am strong i had received in july forwarded by stanley on his flight through boston the fourth volume of friedrich and it was my best reading in the summer and for weeks my only reading one fact was paramount in all the good i drew from it that whomsoever many years had used and worn they had not yet broken any fibre of your force a pure joy to me who abhor the inroads which time makes on me and on my friends to live too long is the capital misfortune and i sometimes think if we shall not parry it by better art of living we shall learn to include in our morals some bolder control of the facts i read once that jacobi declared that he had some thoughts which if he should entertain them would put him to death and perhaps we have weapons in our intellectual armory that are to save us from disgrace and impertinent relation to the world we live in but this book will excuse you from any unseemly haste to make up your accounts nay holds you to fulfil your career with all amplitude and calmness i found joy and pride in it and discerned a golden chain of continuity not often seen in the works of men apprising me that one good head and great heart remained in england immovable superior to his own eccentricities and perversities nay wearing these i can well believe as a jaunty coat or red cockade to defy or mislead idlers for the better securing his own peace and the very ends which the idlers fancy he resists englands lease of power is good during his days i have in these last years lamented that you had not made the visit to america which in earlier years you projected or favored it would have made it impossible that your name should be cited for one moment on the side of the enemies of mankind ten days residence in this country would have made you the organ of the sanity of england and of europe to us and to them and have shown you the necessities and aspirations which struggle up in our free states which as yet have no organ to others and are ill and unsteadily articulated here in our todays division of republican and democrat it is certain that the american nationality lies in the republican party mixed and multiform though that party be and i hold it not less certain that viewing all the nationalities of the world the battle for humanity is at this hour in america a few days here would show you the disgusting composition of the party which within the union resists the national action take from it the wild irish element imported in the last twentyfive years into this country and led by romish priests who sympathize of course with despotism and you would bereave it of all its numerical strength a man intelligent and virtuous is not to be found on that side ah how gladly i would enlist you with your thunderbolt on our part how gladly enlist the wise thoughtful efficient pens and voices of england we want england and europe to hold our people stanch to their best tendency are english of this day incapable of a great sentiment can they not leave caviling at petty failures and bad manners and at the dunce part always the largest part in human affairs and leap to the suggestions and fingerpointings of the gods which above the understanding feed the hopes and guide the wills of men this war has been conducted over the heads of all the actors in it and the foolish terrors what shall we do with the negro the entire black population is coming north to be fed c have strangely ended in the fact that the black refuses to leave his climate gets his living and the living of his employers there as he has always done is the natural ally and soldier of the republic in that climate now takes the place of two hundred thousand white soldiers and will be as the conquest of the country proceeds its garrison till peace without slavery returns slaveholders in london have filled english ears with their wishes and perhaps beliefs and our people generals and politicians have carried the like at first to the war until corrected by irresistible experience i shall always respect war hereafter the cost of life the dreary havoc of comfort and time are overpaid by the vistas it opens of eternal life eternal law reconstructing and uplifting society breaks up the old horizon and we see through the rifts a wider the dismal malthus the dismal debow have had their night our census of and the war are poems which will in the next age inspire a genius like your own i hate to write you a newspaper but in these times t is wonderful what sublime lessons i have once and again read on the bulletinboards in the streets everybody has been wrong in his guess except good women who never despair of an ideal right i thank you for sending to me so gracious a gentleman as mr stanley who interested us in every manner by his elegance his accurate information of that we wished to know and his surprising acquaintance with the camp and military politics on our frontier i regretted that i could see him so little he has used his time to the best purpose and i should gladly have learned all his adventures from so competent a witness forgive this long writing and keep the old kindness which i prize above words my kindest salutations to the dear invalid rw emerson clxxii carlyle to emerson cummertrees annan scotland june dear emerson though my hand is shaking as you sadly notice i determine to write you a little note today what a severance there has been these many sad years past in the first days of february i ended my weary book a totally wornout man got to shore again after far the ugliest sea he had ever swam in in april or the end of march when the book was published i duly handed out a copy for concord and you it was to be sent by mail but as my publisher a new chapman very unlike the old discloses to me lately an incredible negligence on such points it is quite possible the dog may not for a long while have put it in the postoffice though he faithfully charged me the postage of it and was paid and that the poor waif may never yet have reached you patience it will come soon enough there are two thick volumes and they will stand you a great deal of reading stiff rather than light since february last i have been sauntering about in devonshire in chelsea hither thither idle as a dry bone in fact a creature sinking into deeper and deeper collapse after twelve years of such mulish pulling and pushing creature now good for nothing seemingly and much indifferent to being so in permanence if that be the arrangement come upon by the powers that made us some three or four weeks ago i came rolling down hither into this old nook of my birthland to see poor old annandale again with eyes and the poor remnants of kindred and loved ones still left me there i was not at first very lucky lost sleep c but am now doing better pretty much got adjusted to my new element new to me since about six years past the longest absence i ever had from it before my work was getting desperate at that time and i silently said to myself we wont return till it is done or you are done my man this is my eldest living sisters house one of the most rustic farmhouses in the world but abounding in all that is needful to me especially in the truest silentlyactive affection the humble generosity of which is itself medicine and balm the place is airy on dry waving knolls cheerfully with such water as i never drank elsewhere except at malvern all round me are the mountains cheviot and galloway three to fifteen miles off cumberland and yorkshire say forty and fifty with the solway brine and sands intervening i live in total solitude sauntering moodily in thin checkered woods galloping about once daily by old lanes and roads oftenest latterly on the wide expanses of solway shore when the tide is out where i see bright busy cottages far off houses over even in cumberland and the beautifulest amphitheatre of eternal hills but meet no living creature and have endless thoughts as loving and as sad and sombre as i like my youngest brother whom on the whole i like best a rustic man the express image of my father in his ways of living and thinking is within ten miles of me brother john the doctor has come down to dumfries to a sister twelve miles off and runs over to me by rail now and then in few minutes i have books but can hardly be troubled with them pitiful temporary babble and balderdash in comparison to what the silences can say to one enough of all that you perceive me sufficiently at this point of my pilgrimage as withdrawn to hades for the time being intending a months walk there till the muddy semisolutions settle into sediment according to what laws they have and there be perhaps a partial restoration of clearness i have to go deeper into scotland by and by perhaps to try sailing which generally agrees with me but till the end of september i hope there will be no london farther my poor wife who is again poorly since i left and has had frightful sufferings last year especially will probably join me in this region before i leave it and see here this is authentically the way we figure in the eye of the sun and something like what your spectacles could they reach across the ocean into these nooks would teach you of us there are three photographs which i reckon fairly like these are properly what i had to send you today little thinking that so much surplusage would accumulate about them to which i now at once put an end your friend conway who is a boundless admirer of yours used to come our way regularly now and then and we always liked him well a man of most gentlemanly ingenious ways turn of thought always loyal and manly though tending to be rather winged than solidly ambulatory he talked of coming to scotland too but it seems uncertain whether we shall meet he is clearly rather a favorite among the london people and tries to explain america to them i know not if with any success as for me i have entirely lost count and reckoning of your enormous element and its enormous affairs and procedures for some time past and can only wish which no man more heartily does that all may issue in as blessed a way as you hope fat if you know and his fat commonplace at all amused me much by a thing he had heard of yours in some lecture a year or two ago the american eagle is a mighty bird but what is he to the american peacock at which all the audience had exploded into laughter very good adieu old friend yours ever t carlyle mr moncure d conway clxxiii emerson to carlyle concord january dear carlyle is it too late to send a letter to your door to claim an old right to enter and to scatter all your convictions that i had passed under the earth you had not to learn what a sluggish pen mine is of course the sluggishness grows on me and even such a trumpet at my gate as a letter from you heraldingin noble books whilst it gives me joy cannot heal the paralysis yet your letter deeply interested me with the account of your rest so well earned you had fought your great battle and might roll in the grass or ride your pony or shout to the cumberland or scotland echoes with largest leave of men and gods my lethargies have not dulled my delight in good books i read these in the bright days of our new peace which added a lustre to every genial work now first we had a right to read for the very bookworms were driven out of doors whilst the war lasted i found in the book no trace of age which your letter so impressively claimed in the book the hand does not shake the mind is ubiquitous the treatment is so spontaneous selfrespecting defiant liberties with your hero as if he were your client or your son and you were proud of him and yet can check and chide him and even put him in the corner when he is not a good boy freedoms with kings and reputations and nations yes and with principles too that each reader i suppose feels complimented by the confidences with which he is honored by this freetongued masterful hermes who knows what the greek will say next this humor of telling the story in a gale bantering scoffing at the hero at the enemy at the learned reporters is a perpetual flattery to the admiring student the author abusing the whole world as mad dunces all but you and i reader ellery channing borrowed my volumes v and vi worked slowly through them midway came to me for volumes i ii iii iv which he had long already read and at last returned all with this word if you write to mr carlyle you may say to him that i have read these books and they have made it impossible for me to read any other books but his t is a good proof of their penetrative force the influence on the new stirling who writes the secret of hegel he is quite as much a student of carlyle to learn treatment as of hegel for his matter and plays the same game on his essencedividing german which he has learned of you on friedrich i have read a good deal in this book of stirlings and have not done with it one or two errata i noticed in the last volumes of friedrich though the books are now lent and i cannot indicate the pages fort pulaski which is near savannah is set down as near charleston charleston south carolina your printer has twice called charlestown which is the name of the town in massachusetts in which bunker hill stands bancroft told me that the letters of montcalm are spurious we always write and say ticonderoga i am sorry that jonathan looks so unamiable seen from your island yet i have too much respect for the writing profession to complain of it it is a necessity of rhetoric that there should be shades and i suppose geography and government always determine even for the greatest wits where they shall lay their shadows but i have always the belief that a trip across the sea would have abated your despair of us the world is laid out here in large lots and the swing of natural laws is shared by the population as it is not or not as much in your feudal europe my countrymen do not content me but they are susceptible of inspirations in the war it was humanity that showed itself to advantage the leaders were prompted and corrected by the intuitions of the people they still demanding the more generous and decisive measure and giving their sons and their estates as we had no example before in this heat they had sharper perceptions of policy of the ways and means and the life of nations and on every side we read or heard fatewords in private letters in railway cars or in the journals we were proud of the people and believed they would not go down from this height but peace came and every one ran back into his shop again and can hardly be won to patriotism more even to the point of chasing away the thieves that are stealing not only the public gold but the newly won rights of the slave and the new muzzles we had contrived to keep the planter from sucking his blood very welcome to me were the photographs your own and jane carlyles hers now seen here for the first time was closely scanned and confirmed the better accounts that had come of her improved health your earlier tidings of her had not been encouraging i recognized still erect the wise friendly presence first seen at craigenputtock of your own the hatted head is good but more can be read in the head leaning on the hand and the one in a cloak at the end of much writing i have little to tell you of myself i am a bad subject for autobiography as i adjourn letters so i adjourn my best tasks my wife joins me in very kind regards to mrs carlyle use your old magnanimity to me and punish my stony ingratitudes by new letters from time to time ever affectionately and gratefully yours rw emerson clxxiv emerson to carlyle concord may my dear carlyle i have just been shown a private letter from moncure conway to one of his friends here giving some tidings of your sad return to an empty home we had the first news last week and so it is the stroke long threatened has fallen at last in the mildest form to its victim and relieved to you by long and repeated reprieves i must think her fortunate also in this gentle departure as she had been in her serene and honored career we would not for ourselves count covetously the descending steps after we have passed the top of the mount or grudge to spare some of the days of decay and you will have the peace of knowing her safe and no longer a victim i have found myself recalling an old verse which one utters to the parting soul for thou hast passed all chance of human life and not again to thee shall beauty die it is thirtythree years in july i believe since i first saw her and her conversation and faultless manners gave assurance of a good and happy future as i have not witnessed any decline i can hardly believe in any and still recall vividly the youthful wife and her blithe account of her letters and homages from goethe and the details she gave of her intended visit to weimar and its disappointment her goodness to me and to my friends was ever perfect and all americans have agreed in her praise elizabeth hoar remembers her with entire sympathy and regard i could heartily wish to see you for an hour in these lonely days your friends i know will approach you as tenderly as friends can and i can believe that labor all whose precious secrets you know will prove a consoler though it cannot quite avail for she was the rest that rewarded labor it is good that you are strong and built for endurance nor will you shun to consult the awful oracles which in these hours of tenderness are sometimes vouchsafed if to any to you i rejoice that she stayed to enjoy the knowledge of your good day at edinburgh which is a leaf we would not spare from your book of life it was a right manly speech to be so made and is a voucher of unbroken strength and the surroundings as i learn were all the happiest with no hint of change i pray you bear in mind your own counsels long years you must still achieve and i hope neither grief nor weariness will let you join the dim choir of the bards that have been until you have written the book i wish and wait for the sincerest confessions of your best hours my wife prays to be remembered to you with sympathy and affection ever yours faithfully rw emerson clxxv carlyle to emerson mentone france alpes maritimes january my dear emerson it is along time since i last wrote to you and a long distance in space and in fortune from the shores of the solway in summer to this niche of the alps and mediterranean today after what has befallen me in the interim a longer interval i think and surely by far a sadder than ever occurred between us before since we first met in the scotch moors some five and thirty years ago you have written me various notes too and letters all good and cheering to me almost the only truly human speech i have heard from anybody living and still my stony silence could not be broken not till now though often looking forward to it could i resolve on such a thing you will think me far gone and much bankrupt in hope and heart and indeed i am as good as without hope and without fear a gloomily serious silent and sad old man gazing into the final chasm of things in mute dialogue with death judgment and eternity dialogue mute on both sides not caring to discourse with poor articulatespeaking fellow creatures on their sorts of topics it is right of me and yet also it is not right i often feel that i had better be dead than thus indifferent contemptuous disgusted with the world and its roaring nonsense which i have no thought farther of lifting a finger to help and only try to keep out of the way of and shut my door against but the truth is i was nearly killed by that hideous book on friedrich twelve years in continuous wrestle with the nightmares and the subterranean hydras nearly killed and had often thought i should be altogether and must die leaving the monster not so much as finished this is one truth not so evident to any friend or onlooker as it is to myself and then there is another known to myself alone as it were and of which i am best not to speak to others or to speak to them no farther by the calamity of april last i lost my little all in this world and have no soul left who can make any corner of this world into a home for me any more bright heroic tender true and noble was that lost treasure of my heart who faithfully accompanied me in all the rocky ways and climbings and i am forever poor without her she was snatched from me in a moment as by a death from the gods very beautiful her death was radiantly beautiful to those who understand it had all her life been quid plura i should be among the dullest and stupidest if i were not among the saddest of all men but not a word more on all this all summer last my one solacement in the form of work was writing and sorting of old documents and recollections summoning out again into clearness old scenes that had now closed on me without return sad and in a sense sacred it was like a kind of worship the only devout time i had had for a great while past these things i have half or wholly the intention to burn out of the way before i myself die but such continues still mainly my employment so many hours every forenoon what i call the work of my day to me if to no other it is useful to reduce matters to writing means that you shall know them see them in their origins and sequences in their essential lineaments considerably better than you ever did before to set about writing my own life would be no less than horrible to me and shall of a certainty never be done the common impious vulgar of this earth what has it to do with my life or me let dignified oblivion silence and the vacant azure of eternity swallow me for my share of it that verily is the handsomest or one handsome way of settling my poor account with the canaille of mankind extant and to come immortal glory is not that a beautiful thing in the shakespeare clubs and literary gazettes of our improved epoch i did not leave london except for fourteen days in august to a fine and high old lady friends in kent where riding about the woods and by the sea beaches and chalk cliffs in utter silence i felt sadder than ever though a little less miserably so than in the intrusive babblements of london which i could not quite lock out of doors we read at first tennysons idyls with profound recognition of the finely elaborated execution and also of the inward perfection of vacancy and to say truth with considerable impatience at being treated so very like infants though the lollipops were so superlative we gladly changed for one emersons english traits and read that with increasing and ever increasing satisfaction every evening blessing heaven that there were still books for grownup people too that truly is a book all full of thoughts like winged arrows thanks to the bowyer from us both my ladyfriends name is miss davenport bromley it was at wooton in her grandfathers house in staffordshire that rousseau took shelter in and one hundred and six years later she was reading emerson to me with a recognition that would have pleased the man had he seen it about that same time my health and humors being evidently so the dowager lady ashburton not the high lady you saw but a successor of mackenziehighland type who wanders mostly about the continent since her widowhood for the sake of a childs health began pressing and inviting me to spend the blade months of winter here in her villa with her all friends warmly seconding and urging by one of whom i was at last snatched off as if by the hair of the head in spite of my violent no no on the eve of christmas last and have been here ever since really with improved omens the place is beautiful as a very picture the climate superlative today a sun and sky like very june the hospitality of usage beyond example it is likely i shall be here another six weeks or longer if you please to write me the address is on the margin and i will answer adieu t carlyle clxxvi carlyle to emerson cheyne row chelsea november dear emerson it is near three years since i last wrote to you from mentone under the ligurian olive and orange trees and their sombre foreign shadows and still more sombre suggestings and promptings the saddest probably of all living men that you made no answer i know right well means only alas what can i say to him of consolatory that he does not himself know far from a fault or perhaps even a mistake on your part nor have i felt it otherwise sure enough among the lights that have gone out for me and are still going one after one under the inexorable decree in this now dusky and lonely world i count with frequent regret that our correspondence not by absolute hest of fate should have fallen extinct or into such abeyance but i interpret it as you see and my love and brotherhood to you remain alive and will while i myself do enough of this by lucky chance as you perceive you are again to get one written letter from me and i a reply from you before the final silence come the case is this for many years back a thought which i used to check again as fond and silly has been occasionally present to me of testifying my gratitude to new england new england acting mainly through one of her sons called waldo emerson by bequeathing to it my poor falstaf regiment latterly two falstaf regiments of books those i purchased and used in writing cromwell and ditto those on friedrich the great this could be done i often said to myself this could perhaps and this would be a real satisfaction to me but who then would march through coventry with such a set the extreme insignificance of the gift this and nothing else always gave me pause last summer i was lucky enough to meet with your friend ce norton and renew many old massachusetts recollections in free talk with him to him i spoke of the affair candidly describing it especially the above questionable feature of it so far as i could and his answer then and more deliberately afterwards was so hopeful hearty and decisive that in effect it has decided me and i am this day writing to him that such is the poor fact and that i need farther instructions on it so soon as you two have taken counsel together to say more about the infinitesimally small value of the books would be superfluous nay in truth many or most of them are not without intrinsic value one or two are even excellent as books and all of them it may perhaps be said have a kind of symbolic or biographic value and testify a thing not useless on what slender commissariat stores considerable campaigns twelve years long or so may be carried on in this world perhaps you already knew of me what the cromwell and friedrich collection might itself intimate that much buying of books was never a habit of mine far the reverse even to this day well my friend you will have a meeting with norton so soon as handy and let me know what is next to be done and that in your official capacity is all i have to say to you at present unofficially there were much much that is mournful but perhaps also something that is good and blessed and though the saddest also the highest the lovingest and best as beseems times sunset now coming nigh at present i will say only that in bodily health i am not to be called ill for a man who will be seventyfour next month nor on the spiritual side has anything been laid upon me that is quite beyond my strength more miserable i have often been though as solitary soft of heart and sad of course never publisher chapman when i question him whether you for certain get your monthly volume of what they call the library edition assures me that it is beyond doubt i confess i should still like to be better assured if all is right you should by the time this letter arrives be receiving or have received your thirteenth volume last of the miscellanies adieu my friend ever truly yours t carlyle clxxvii carlyle to emerson chelsea january dear emerson a month ago or more i wrote by the same post to you and to norton about those books for harvard college and in late days have been expecting your joint answer from norton yesternight i receive what is here copied for your perusal it has come round by florence as you see and given me real pleasure and instruction from you who are possibly also away from home i have yet nothing but expect now soon to have a few words there did arrive one evening lately your two pretty volumes of collected works a pleasant salutation from you which set me upon reading again what i thought i knew well before but the letter is still to come nortons hints are such a complete instruction to me that i see my way straight through the business and might by note of bequest and memorandum for the barings finish it in half an hour nevertheless i will wait for your letter and punctually do nothing till your directions too are before me pray write therefore all is lying ready here since you heard last i have got two catalogues made out approximately correct one is to lie here till the bequest be executed the other i thought of sending to you against the day this is my own invention in regard to the affair since i wrote last approve of it and you shall have your copy by bookpost at once approximately correct absolutely i cannot get it to be but i need not doubt the pious purpose will be piously and even sacredly fulfilled and your catalogue will be a kind of evidence that it is adieu dear emerson till your letter come yours ever thomas carlyle clxxviii emerson to carlyle concord january my dear carlyle t is a sad apology that i have to offer for delays which no apology can retrieve i received your first letter with pure joy but in the midst of extreme inefficiency i had suddenly yielded to a proposition of fields co to manufacture a book for a given day the book was planned and going on passably when it was found better to divide the matter and separate and postpone the purely literary portion criticism chiefly and therefore to modify and swell the elected part the attempt proved more difficult than i had believed for i only write by spasms and these ever more rare and daemons that have no ears meantime the publication day was announced and the printer at the door then came your letter in the shortening days when i drudged to keep my word invita minerva this letter is printed from an imperfect rough draft i could not write in my book and i could not write a letter tomorrow and many morrows made things worse for we have indifferent health in the house and as it chanced unusual strain of affairs which always come when they should not for one thing i have just sold a house which i once built opposite my own but i will leave the bad month which i hope will not match itself in my lifetime only t is pathetic and remorseful to me that any purpose of yours especially a purpose so inspired should find me imbecile heartily i delight in your proposed disposition of the books it has every charm of surprise and nobleness and large affection the act will deeply gratify a multitude of good men who will see in it your real sympathy with the welfare of the country i hate that there should be a moment of delay in the completing of your provisions and that i of all men should be the cause nortons letter is perfect on his part and needs no addition i believe from me you had not in your first letter named cambridge and i had been meditating that he would probably have divided your attention between harvard and the boston public library now the richest in the country at first founded by the gifts of joshua bates of london and since enriched by the city and private donors theodore parker among them but after conversation with two or three friends i had decided that harvard college was the right beneficiary as being the mother real or adoptive of a great number of your lovers and readers in america and because a college is a seat of sentiment and cosmical relations the library is outgrown by other libraries in the country counts only bound volumes in the several departments of divinity law medicine and natural science in the university having special libraries that together add some more the college is newly active with its new president eliot a cousin of nortons and expansive in all directions and the library will be relieved through subscriptions now being collected among the alumni with the special purpose of securing to it an adequate fund for annual increase i shall then write to norton at once that i concur with him in the destination of the books to harvard college and approve entirely his advices in regard to details and so soon as you send me the catalogue i shall if you permit communicate your design to president eliot and the corporation one thing i shall add to the catalogue now or later perhaps only by bequest your own prized gift to me in of woods athenae oxonienses which i have lately had rebound and in which every pen and pencil mark of yours is notable the stately books of the new edition have duly come from the unforgetting friend i have sartor schiller french revolution vols miscellanies numbers ten volumes in all excellently printed and dressed and full of memories and electricity i have much to say but of things not opportune at this moment and in spite of my long contumacy dare believe that i shall quickly write again my proper letter to my friend whose every word i watchfully read and remember clxxix carlyle to emerson melchet court romsey february dear emerson three days ago i at last received your letter with very great pleasure and thankfulness as you may suppose indeed it is quite strangely interesting to see face to face my old emerson again not a feature of him changed whom i have known all the best part of my life i am very glad withal to find that you agree completely with norton and myself in regard to that small harvard matter this is not chelsea as you perceive this is a hospitable mansion in hampshire but i expect to be in chelsea within about a week once there i shall immediately despatch to you one of the three catalogues i have with a more deliberate letter than i at present have the means of writing or dictating yours ever truly t carlyle clxxx carlyle to emerson chelsea february dear emerson at length i have got home from those sumptuous tumults melchet court is the dowager lady ashburtons house whose late husband an estimable friend of mine and half american you may remember here and i devote to ending of our small harvard business small enough but true and kindly the first quiet hour i have your copy of the catalogue which accompanies by bookpost of today is the correctest i could manage to get done all the books mentioned in it i believe to be now here and indeed except five or six tiny articles have seen them all in one or other of the three rooms where my books now stand and where i believe the insignificant trifle of tinies to be all these i can expect will be punctually attended to when the time comes and proceeded with according to nortons scheme and yours and if any more tinies which i could not even remember should turn up which i hardly think there will these also will class themselves as cromwelliana or fredericana and be faith fully sent on with the others for benefit of my survivors and representatives here i retain an exact copy of the catalogue now put into your keeping so that everything may fall out square between them and you when the time shall arrive i mean to conform in every particular to the plan sketched out by norton and you unless in your next letter you have something other or farther to advise and so soon as i hear from you that harvard accepts my poor widows mite of a bequest i will proceed to put it down in due form and so finish this small matter which for long years has hovered in my thoughts as a thing i should like to do and so enough for this time i meant to write a longish letter touching on many other points though you see i am reduced to pencil and write with such difficulty never yet could learn to dictate though my little niece here is promptitude itself and is so swift and legible useful here as a cheerful rushlight in this now sombre element sombre sad but also beautiful and tenderly solemn more and more in which she bears me company good little mary but in bar of all such purposes publisher chapman has come in with cromwell engravings and their hindrances with money accounts c c and has not even left me a moment of time were nothing else needed vol xiv cromwell i ought to be at concord about as soon as this in our newspapers i notice your book announced half of the essays new which i hope to get quam primum and illuminate some evenings with so as nothing else can in my present common mood adieu dear old friend i am and remain yours always t carlyle clxxxi emerson to carlyle concord march my dear carlyle on receiving your letter and catalogue i wrote out a little history of the benefaction and carried it last tuesday to president eliot at cambridge who was heartily gratified and saw everything rightly and expressed an anxiety most becoming in my eyes after my odious shortcomings that there should be no moment of delay on our part the corporation would not meet again for a fortnight but he would not wait would call a special meeting this week to make the communication to them he did so the meeting was held on saturday and i have received this monday morning from him enclosed letter and record it is very amiable and noble in you to have kept this surprise for us in your older days did you mean to show us that you could not be old but immortally young and having kept us all murmuring at your satires and sharp homilies will now melt us with this manly and heartwarming embrace nobody could predict and none could better it and you shall even go your own gait henceforward with a blessing from us all and a trust exceptional and unique i do not longer hesitate to talk to such good men as i see of this gift and it has in every ear a gladdening effect people like to see character in a gift and from rare character the gift is more precious i wish it may be twice blest in continuing to give you the comfort it will give us i think i must mend myself by reclaiming my old right to send you letters i doubt not i shall have much to tell you could i overcome the hesitation to attempt a reasonable letter when one is driven to write so many sheets of mere routine as sixtysix nearly sixtyseven years enforce i shall have to prate of my daughters edith forbes with her two children at milton ellen emerson at home herself a godsend to this house day by day and my son edward studying medicine in boston whom i have ever meant and still mean to send that he may see your face when that professional curriculum winds up i manage to read a few books and look into more herman grimm sent me lately a good one goethes unterhaltungen with muller which set me on varnhagen and others my wife sends old regards and her joy in this occasion yours ever rw emerson ps mr eliot took my rough counting of volumes as correct when he sends me back the catalogue i will make it exact i sent you last week a little book by bookpost clxxxii carlyle to emerson cheyne row chelsea march my dear emerson the day before yesterday i heard incidentally of an unfortunate mail steamer bound for america which had lost its screw or some essential part of it and so had instead of carrying its letters forward to america been drifting about like a helpless log on the shores of ireland till some three days ago when its letters and passengers were taken out and actually forwarded thither by industrious calculation it appears probable to us here that my letter to you may have been tumbling about in that helpless steamer instead of getting to concord where if so said letter cannot now arrive till the lingering of it have created some astonishment there i hastily write this however to say that a letter was duly forwarded a few days after yours of january arrived enclosing the harvard catalogue with all necessary et ceteras indorsing all your proposals and signifying that the matter should be authentically completed the instant i should hear from you again i may add now that the thing is essentially completed all signed and put on paper or all but a word or two which for forms sake waits the actual arrival of your letter i have never yet received your book and if it linger only a few days more mean to provide myself with a copy such as the sampson and low people have on sale everywhere i had from norton the other day a very kind and friendly letter this is all of essential that i had to say i write in utmost haste but am always dear emerson yours sincerely t carlyle society and solitude clxxxiii carlyle to emerson chelsea april dear emerson the day before yesterday your welcome letter came to hand with the welcome news in it yesterday i put into my poor document here the few words still needed locked everything into its still repository your letter president eliots nortons c c and walked out into the sunshine piously thankful that a poor little whim which had long lain fondly in my heart had realized itself with an emphasis i could never hope and was become thanks to generous enthusiasm on new englands part a beautiful little fact lying done there so far as i had to do with it truly your account of matters threw a glow of life into my thoughts which is very rare there now altogether a gratifying little transaction to me and i must add a surprising for the enthusiasm of goodwill is evidently great and the occasion is almost infinitesimally small well well it is all finished off and completed you can tell mr eliot with many thanks from me that i did introduce the proper style president and fellows c and have forgotten nothing of what he said or of what he did and so we will say only faustum sit as our last word on the subject and to me it will be for some days yet under these vernal skies something that is itself connected with the spring in a still higher sense a little white and redlipped bit of daisy pure and poor scattered into times seedfield and struggling above ground there uttering its bit of prophecy withal among the oxhoofs and big jungles that are everywhere about and not prophetic of much one thing only i regret that you have spoken of the affair for gods sake dont and those kindly people to whom you have swear them to silence for love of me the poor little daisykin will get into the newspapers and become the nastiest of cabbages silence silence i beg of you to the utmost stretch of your power or is the case already irremediable i will hope not talk about such things especially penny editors talk is like vile coalsmoke filling your poor little world silence alone is azure and has a sky to it but enough now the little book never came and i doubt never will it is a fate that seems to await three fourths of the books that attempt to reach me by the american post owing to some informality in wrapping i have heard it never gave me any notable regret till now however i had already bought myself an english copy rather gaudy little volume probably intended for the railways as if it were a book to be read there but perfectly printed ready to be read anywhere by the open eye and earnest mind which i read here accordingly with great attention clear assent for most part and admiring recognition it seems to me you are all your old self here and something more a calm insight piercing to the very centre a beautiful sympathy a beautiful epic humor a soul peaceably irrefragable in this loudjangling world of which it sees the ugliness but notices only the huge new opulences still so anarchic knows the electric telegraph with all its vulgar botherations and impertinences accurately for what it is and ditto ditto the oldest eternal theologies of men all this belongs to the highest class of thought you may depend upon it and again seemed to me as in several respects the one perfectly human voice i had heard among my fellowcreatures for a long time and then the style the treatment and expression yes it is inimitable best emersonian throughout such brevity simplicity softness homely grace with such a penetrating meaning soft enough but irresistible going down to the depths and up to the heights as silent electricity goes you have done very well and many will know it ever better by degrees only one thing farther i will note how you go as if altogether on the oversoul the ideal the perfect or universal and eternal in this life of ours and take so little heed of the frightful quantities of friction and perverse impediment there everywhere are the reflections upon which in my own poor life made me now and then very sad as i read you ah me ah me what a vista it is mournful beautiful unfathomable as eternity itself these last fifty years of time to me let me not forget to thank you for that fourth page of your note i should say it was almost the most interesting of all news from yourself at first hand a momentary glimpse into the actual household at concord face to face as in years of old true i get vague news of you from time to time but what are these in comparison if you will at the eleventh hour turn over a new leaf and write me letters again but i doubt you wont and yet were it not worth while think you greek will be here anon my kindest regards to your wife adieu my everkind old friend yours faithfully always t carlyle clxxxiv emerson to carlyle concord june my dear carlyle two unanswered letters filled and fragrant and potent with goodness will not let me procrastinate another minute or i shall sink and deserve to sink into my dormouse condition you are of the anakim and know nothing of the debility and postponement of the blonde constitution well if you shame us by your reservoir inexhaustible of force you indemnify and cheer some of us or one of us by charges of electricity one seems to be missing your letter of april came as evermore than ever if possible full of kindness and making much of our small doings and writings and seemed to drive me to instant acknowledgment but the oppressive engagement of writing and reading eighteen lectures on philosophy to a class of graduates in the college and these in six successive weeks was a task a little more formidable in prospect and in practice than any foregoing one of course it made me a prisoner took away all rights of friendship honor and justice and held me to such frantic devotion to my work as must spoil that also well it is now ended and has no shining side but this one that materials are collected and a possibility shown me how a repetition of the course next year which is appointed will enable me partly out of these materials and partly by large rejection of these and by large addition to them to construct a fair report of what i have read and thought on the subject i doubt the experts in philosophy will not praise my discourses but the topics give me room for my guesses criticism admirations and experiences with the accepted masters and also the lessons i have learned from the hidden great i have the fancy that a realist is a good corrector of formalism no matter how incapable of syllogism or continuous linked statement to great results of thought and morals the steps are not many and it is not the masters who spin the ostentatious continuity i am glad to hear that the last sent book from me arrived safely you were too tender and generous in your first notice of it i fear but with whatever deductions for your partiality i know well the unique value of carlyles praise many things crowd to be said on this little paper though i could see no harm in the making known the bequest of books to cambridge no harm but sincere pleasure and honor of the donor from all good men yet on receipt of your letter touching that i went back to president eliot and told him your opinion on newspapers he said it was necessarily communicated to the seven persons composing the corporation but otherwise he had been very cautious and it would not go into print you are sending me a book and chapmans homer it is are you bound by your arabian bounty to a largess whenever you think of your friend and you decry the book too tis long since i read it or in it but the apotheosis of homer in the dedication to prince henry thousands of years attending c is one of my lasting inspirations the book has not arrived yet as the letter always travels faster but shall be watched and received and announced but since you are all bounty and care for me where are the new volumes of the library edition of carlyle i received duly as i wrote you in a former letter nine volumes sartor life of schiller five vols of miscellanies french revolution these books oddly addressed to my name but at cincinnati massachusetts whether they went to ohio and came back to boston i know not two volumes came later duplicates of two already received and were returned at my request by fields co with an explanation but no following volume has come i write all this because you said in one letter that mr chapman assured you that every month a book was despatched to my address but what do i read in our boston newspapers twice in the last three days that thomas carlyle is coming to america and the tidings cordially greeted by the editors though i had just received your letter silent to any such point make that story true though it had never a verisimilitude since thirty odd years ago and you shall make many souls happy and perhaps show you so many needs and opportunities for beneficent power that you cannot be allowed to grow old or withdraw was i not once promised a visit this house entreats you earnestly and lovingly to come and dwell in it my wife and ellen and edward e are thoroughly acquainted with your greatness and your loveliness and it is but ten days of healthy sea to pass so wishes heartily and affectionately rw emerson clxxxv carlyle to emerson cheyne row chelsea september dear emerson your letter dated june never got to me till about ten days ago when my little niece and i returned out of scotland and a long rather empty visit there it had missed me here only by two or three days and my highly infelicitous selectress of letters to be forwarded had left it carefully aside as undeserving that honor good faithful old woman one hopes she is greatly stronger on some sides than in this literaryselective one certainly no letter was forwarded that had the hundredth part of the right to be so certainly of all the letters that came to me or were left waiting here this was in comparison the one which might not with propriety have been left to lie stranded forever or to wander on the winds forever one of my first journeys was to chapman with vehement rebuke of this inconceivable cincinnatimassachusetts business stupiditas stupiditatum i never in my life not even in that unpunctual house fell in with anything that equaled it instant amendment was at once undertaken for nay it seems had been already in part performed ten volumes following the nine you already had were despatched in field cos box above two months ago so chapman solemnly said and asseverated to me so that by this time you ought actually to have in hand nineteen volumes and the twentieth first of friedrich which came out ten days ago is to go in field cos box this week and ought not many days after the arrival of this letter to be in boston waiting for you there the chapmans homer two volumes had gone with that first field packet and would be handed to you along with the ten volumes which were overdue all this was solemnly declared to me as on affidavit chapman also took extract of the massachusetts passage in your letter in order to pour it like icecold water on the head of his stupid old chiefclerk the instant the poor creature got back from his rustication alas i am by no means certain that it will make a new man of him nor in fact that the whole of this amendatory programme will get itself performed to equal satisfaction but you must write to me at once if it is not so and done it shall be in spite of human stupidity itself note withal these things chapman sends no books to america except through field co he does not regularly send a box at the middle of the month but he does almost monthly send one bog so that if your monthly volume do not start from london about the th it is due by the very next chapmanfield box and if it at any time dont come i beg of you very much to make instant complaint through field co or what would be still more effectual direct to myself my malison on all blockheadisms and torpid stupidities and infidelities of which this world is full your letter had been anxiously enough waited for a month before my departure but we will not mention the delay in presence of what you were engaged with then faustum sit that truly was and will be a work worth doing your best upon and i if alive can promise you at least one reader that will do his best upon your work i myself often think of the philosophies precisely in that manner to say truth they do not otherwise rise in esteem with me at all but rather sink the last thing i read of that kind was a piece by hegel in an excellent translation by stirling right well translated i could see for every bit of it was intelligible to me but my feeling at the end of it was good heavens i have walked this road before many a good time but never with a cannonball at each ankle before science also science falsely so called is but i will not enter upon that with you just now the visit to america alas alas is pure moonshine never had i in late years the least shadow of intention to undertake that adventure and i am quite at a loss to understand how the rumor originated one boston gentleman a kind of universal undertaker or lions provider of lecturers i think informed me that the cable had told him and i had to remark and who the devil told the cable alas no i fear i shall never dare to undertake that big voyage which has so much of romance and of reality behind it to me zu spat zu spat i do sometimes talk dreamily of a long seavoyage and the good the sea has often done me in times when good was still possible it may have been some vague folly of that kind that originated this rumor for rumors are like dandelionseeds and the cable i dare say welcomes them all that have a guinea in their pocket thank you for blocking up that harvard matter provided it dont go into the newspapers all is right thank you a thousand times for that thricekind potential welcome and flinging wide open your doors and your hearts to me at concord the gleam of it is like sunshine in a subterranean place ah me ah me may god be with you all dear emerson yours ever t carlyle clxxxvi emerson to carlyle concord october my dear carlyle i am the ignoblest of all men in my perpetual shortcomings to you there is no example of constancy like yours and it always stings my stupor into temporary recovery and wonderful resolution to accept the noble challenge but the strong hours conquer us and i am the victim of miscellany miscellany of designs vast debility and procrastination already many days before your letter came fields sent me a package from you which he said he had found a little late because they were covered up in a box of printed sheets of other character and this treasure was not at first discovered they are life of sterling latter day pamphlets past and present heroes vols cromwells letters and speeches unhappily vol ii of cromwell is wanting and there is a duplicate of vol v instead of it now two days ago came your letter and tells me that the good old gods have also inspired you to send me chapmans homer and that it came heroes with heroes in the same enchanted box i went to fields yesterday and demanded the book he ignored all even to the books he had already sent me called osgood to council and they agreed that it must be that all these came in a bog of sheets of dickens from chapman which was sent to the stereotypers at cambridge and the box shall be instantly explored we will see what tomorrow shall find as to the duplicates i will say here that i have received two first the abovementioned vol ii of cromwell and second long before a second copy of sartor resartus apparently instead of the vol i of the french revolution which did not come i proposed to fields to send back to chapman these two duplicates but he said no it will cost as much as the price of the books i shall try to find in new york who represents chapman and sells these books and put them to his credit there in exchange for the volumes i lack meantime my serious thanks for all these treasures go to you steadily good to my youth and my age your letter was most welcome and most in that i thought i read in what you say of not making the longpromised visit hither a little willingness to come think again i pray you of that ocean voyage which is probably the best medicine and restorative which remains to us at your age and mine nine or ten days will bring you and commonly with unexpected comfort and easements on the way to boston every reading person in america holds you in exceptional regard and will rejoice in your arrival they have forgotten your scarlet sins before or during the war i have long ceased to apologize for or explain your savage sayings about american or other republics or publics and am willing that anointed men bearing with them authentic charters shall be laws to themselves as plato willed genius is but a large infusion of deity and so brings a prerogative all its own it has a right and duty to affront and amaze men by carrying out its perceptions defiantly knowing well that time and fate will verify and explain what time and fate have through them said we must not suggest to michel angelo or machiavel or rabelais or voltaire or john brown of osawatomie a great man or carlyle how they shall suppress their paradoxes and check their huge gait to keep accurate step with the procession on the street sidewalk they are privileged persons and may have their own swing for me i did not mean to chatter so much but i wish you would come out hither and read our possibilities now being daily disclosed and our actualities which are not nothing i shall like to show you my near neighbors topographically or practically a near neighbor and friend e rockwood hoar whom you saw in his youth is now an inestimable citizen in this state and lately in president grants cabinet attorneygeneral of the united states he lives in this town and carries it in his hand another is john m forbes a strictly private citizen of great executive ability and noblest affections a motive power and regulator essential to our city refusing all office but impossible to spare and these are men whom to name the voice breaks and the eye is wet a multitude of young men are growing up here of high promise and i compare gladly the social poverty of my youth with the power on which these draw the lowell race again in our war yielded three or four martyrs so able and tender and true that james russell lowell cannot allude to them in verse or prose but the public is melted anew well all these know you well have read and will read you yes and will prize and use your benefaction to the college and i believe it would add hope health and strength to you to come and see them in my much writing i believe i have left the chief things unsaid but come i and my house wait for you affectionately rw emerson clxxxvia emerson to carlyle concord april my dear friend i fear there is no pardon from you none from myself for this immense new gap in our correspondence yet no hour came from month to month to write a letter since whatever deliverance i got from one web in the last year served only to throw me into another web as pitiless yet what gossamer these tasks of mine must appear to your might believe that the american climate is unmanning or that one american whom you know is severely taxed by lilliput labors the last hot summer enfeebled me till my young people coaxed me to go with edward to the white hills and we climbed or were dragged up agiocochook in august and its sleet and snowy air nerved me again for the time but the booksellers whom i had long ago urged to reprint plutarchs morals claimed some forgotten promise and set me on reading the old patriarch again and writing a few pages about him which no doubt cost me as much time and pottering as it would cost you to write a history then an oration was due to the new england society in new york on the th anniversary of the plymouth landing as i thought myself familiar with the story and holding also some opinions thereupon but in the libraries i found alcoves full of books and documents reckoned essential and at new york after reading for an hour to the great assembly out of my massy manuscript i refused to print a line until i could revise and complete my papers risking of course the nonsense of their newspaper reporters this pill swallowed and forgotten it was already time for my second course on philosophy at cambridge which i had accepted again that i might repair the faults of the last year but here were eighteen lectures each to be read sixteen miles away from my house to go and come and the same work and journey twice in each week and i have just got through the doleful ordeal i have abundance of good readings and some honest writing on the leading topics but in haste and confusion they are misplaced and spoiled i hope the ruin of no young mans soul will here or hereafter be charged to me as having wasted his time or confounded his reason now i come to the raid of a london bookseller hotten of whom i believe i never told you on my forgotten papers in the old dials and other pamphlets here conway wrote me that he could not be resisted would certainly steal good and bad but might be guided in the selection i replied that the act was odious to me and i promised to denounce the man and his theft to any friends i might have in england but if instead of printing then he would wait a year i would make my own selection with the addition of some later critical papers and permit the book mr ireland in manchester and conway in london took the affair kindly in hand and hotten acceded to my change and that is the next task that threatens my imbecility but now ten days ago or less my friend john m forbes has come to me with a proposition to carry me off to california the yosemite the mammoth trees and the pacific and after much resistance i have surrendered for six weeks and we set out tomorrow and hence this sheet of confession that i may not drag a lengthening chain meantime you have been monthly loading me with good for evil i have just counted twentythree volumes of carlyles library edition in order on my shelves besides two or perhaps three which ellery channing has borrowed add that the precious chapmans homer came safely though not till months after you had told me of its departure and shall be guarded henceforward with joy wednesday chicago arrived here and can bring this little sheet to the postoffice here my daughter edith forbes and her husband william h forbes and three other friends accompany me and we shall overtake mr forbes senior tomorrow at burlington iowa the widow of one of the noblest of our young martyrs in the war col lowell cousin nephew of james russell lowell sends me word that she wishes me to give her a note of introduction to you confiding to me that she has once written a letter to you which procured her the happiest reply from you and i shall obey her and you will see her and own her rights still continue to be magnanimous to your friend rw emerson charles russell lowell to be remembered always with honor in company with his brother james jackson lowell and his cousin william lowell putnam a shining group among the youths who have died for their country clxxxvii carlyle to emerson cheyne row chelsea june dear emerson your letter gave me great pleasure a gleam of sunshine after a long tract of lowering weather it is not you that are to blame for this sad gap in our correspondence it is i or rather it is my misfortunes and miserable inabilities broken resolutions etc etc the truth is the winter here was very unfriendly to me broke ruinously into my sleep and through that into every other department of my businesses spiritual and temporal so that from about newyears day last i have been in a manner good for nothing nor am yet though i do again feel as if the beautiful summer weather might perhaps do something for me this it was that choked every enterprise and postponed your letter week after week through so many months let us not speak of it farther note meanwhile i have no disease about me nothing but the gradual decay of any poor digestive faculty i latterly had or indeed ever had since i was three and twenty years of age let us be quiet with it accept it as a mode of exit of which always there must be some mode i have got done with all my presscorrectings editionings and paltry bother of that kind vol will embark for you about the middle of this month there are then to follow uniform as the printers call it though in smaller type a little volume called general index and three more volumes of translations from the german after which we two will reckon and count and if there is any lacuna on the concord shelf at once make it good enough enough on that score the hotten who has got hold of you here is a dirty little pirate who snatches at everybody grown fat enough to yield him a bite paltry unhanged creature so that in fact he is a symbol to you of your visible rise in the world here and with conways vigilance to help will do you good and not evil glad am i in any case to see so much new spiritual produce still ripening around you and you ought to be glad too pray heaven you may long keep your right hand steady you too i can perceive will never any more than myself learn to write by dictation in a manner that will be supportable to you i rejoice also to hear of such a magnificent adventure as that you are now upon climbing the backbone of america looking into the pacific ocean too and the gigantic wonders going on there i fear you wont see brigham young however he also to me is one of the products out there and indeed i may confess to you that the doings in that region are not only of a big character but of a great and that in my occasional explosions against anarchy and my inextinguishable hatred of it i privately whisper to myself could any friedrich wilhelm now or friedrich or most perfect governor you could hope to realize guide forward what is americas essential task at present faster or more completely than anarchic america herself is now doing such anarchy has a great deal to say for itself would to heaven ours of england had as much and points towards grand antianarchies in the future in fact i can already discern in it huge quantities of antianarchy in the impalpablepowder condition and hope with the aid of centuries immense things from it in my private mind good mrs has never yet made her appearance but shall be welcome whenever she does did you ever hear the name of an aged or elderly fantastic fellowcitizen of yours called j lee bliss who designates himself of and ak ie old fogey and amiable kuss he sent me the other night a wonderful miscellany of symbolical shreds and patches which considerably amused me and withal indicated goodwill on the mans part who is not without humor in sight and serious intention or disposition if you ever did hear of him say a word on the subject next time you write and above all things write the instant you get home from california or see this let me hear from you what your adventures have been and what the next are to be adieu dear emerson yours ever affectionately t carlyle mrs sends a note from piccadilly this new morning june th call to be made there today by niece mary card left etc etc promises to be an agreeable lady did you ever hear of such a thing as this suicidal finis of the french copper captaincy gratuitous attack on germany and ditto blowingup of paris by its own hand an event with meanings unspeakable deep as the abyss if you ever write to c norton in italy send him my kind remembrances t c with about the velocity of engraving on lead the letter was dictated but the postscript from the first signature was written in a tremulous hand by carlyle himself clxxxviii emerson to carlyle concord june my dear carlyle t is more than time that you should hear from me whose debts to you always accumulate but my long journey to california ended in many distractions on my return home i found varioloid in my house and i was not permitted to enter it for many days and could only talk with wife son and daughter from the yard i had crowded and closed my cambridge lectures in haste and went to the land of flowers invited by john m forbes one of my most valued friends father of my daughter ediths husband with him and his family and one or two chosen guests the trip was made under the best conditions of safety comfort and company i measuring for the first time one entire line of the country california surprises with a geography climate vegetation beasts birds fishes even unlike ours the land immense the pacific sea steam brings the near neighborhood of asia and south america at your feet the mountains reaching the altitude of mont blanc the state in its six hundred miles of latitude producing all our northern fruits and also the fig orange and banana but the climate chiefly surprised me the almanac said april but the day said june and day after day for six weeks uninterrupted sunshine november and december are the rainy months the whole country was covered with flowers and all of them unknown to us except in greenhouses every bird that i know at home is represented here but in gayer plumes on the plains we saw multitudes of antelopes hares gophers even elks and one pair of wolves on the plains the grizzly bear only in a cage we crossed one region of the buffalo but only saw one captive we found indians at every railroad station the squaws and papooses begging and the bucks as they wickedly call them lounging on our way out we left the pacific railroad for twentyfour hours to visit salt lake called on brigham young just seventy years old who received us with quiet uncommitting courtesy at first a strongbuilt selfpossessed sufficient man with plain manners he took early occasion to remark that the onemanpower really meant all menspower our interview was peaceable enough and rather mended my impression of the man and after our visit i read in the descret newspaper his speech to his people on the previous sunday it avoided religion but was full of franklinian good sense in one point he says your fear of the indians is nonsense the indians like the white mens food feed them well and they will surely die he is clearly a sufficient ruler and perhaps civilizer of his kingdom of blockheads ad interim but i found that the san franciscans believe that this exceptional power cannot survive brigham i have been surprised but it is months ago by a letter from lacy garbett the architect whom i do not know but one of whose books about design in architecture i have always valued this letter asking of me that americans shall join englishmen in a petition to parliament against pulling down ancient saxon buildings is written in a way so wild as to suggest insanity and i have not known how to answer it at my saturday club in boston i sat at dinner by an english lord whose name i have forgotten from whom i tried to learn what laws parliament had passed for the repairs of old religious foundations that could make them the victims of covetous architects but he assured me there were none such and that he himself was president of a society in his own county for the protection of such buildings so that i am left entirely in the dark in regard to the fact and garbetts letter he claims to speak both for ruskin and himself i grieve to hear no better account of your health than your last letter gives the only contradiction of it namely the power of your pen in this reproduction of thirty books and such books is very important and very consoling to me a great work to be done is the best insurance and i sleep quietly notwithstanding these sad bulletins believing that you cannot be spared fare well dear friend rw emerson clxxxix emerson to carlyle concord september my dear carlyle i hope you will have returned safely from the orkneys in time to let my son edward we see your face on his way through london to germany whither he goes to finish his medical studies no not finish but prosecute give him your blessing and tell him what he should look for in his few days in london and what in your prussia he is a good youth and we can spare him only for this necessity i should like well to accompany him as far as to your hearthstone if only so i could persuade you that it is but a tendays ride for you thence to mine a little farther than the orkneys and the outskirts of land as good and bigger i read gladly in your letters some relentings toward america deeper ones in your dealing with harvard college and i know you could not see without interest the immense and varied blossoming of our possibilities here of all nationalities too besides our own i have heard from mrs twice lately who exults in your kindness to her always affectionately yours rw emerson cxc emerson to carlyle baltimore md january my dear carlyle i received from you through mr chapman just before christmas the last rich instalment of your library edition viz vols ivx life of friedrich vols liii translations from german one volume general index eleven volumes in all and now my stately collection is perfect perfect too is your victory but i clatter my chains with joy as i did forty years ago at your earliest gifts happy man you should be to whom the heaven has allowed such masterly completion you shall wear your crown at the pansaxon games with no equal or approaching competitor in sight well earned by genius and exhaustive labor and with nations for your pupils and praisers i count it my eminent happiness to have been so nearly your contemporary and your friend permitted to detect by its rare light the new star almost before the easterners had seen it and to have found no disappointment but joyful confirmation rather in coming close to its orb rest rest now for a time i pray you and be thankful meantime i know well all your perversities and give them a wide berth they seriously annoy a great many worthy readers nations of readers sometimes but i heap them all as style and read them as i read rabelaiss gigantic humors which astonish in order to force attention and by and by are seen to be the rhetoric of a highly virtuous gentleman who swears i have been quite too busy with fast succeeding jobs i may well call them in the last year to have read much in these proud books but i begin to see daylight coming through my fogs and i have not lost in the least my appetite for reading resolve with my old harvard professor to retire and read the authors i am impatient to deserve your grand volumes by reading in them with all the haughty airs that belong to seventy years which i shall count if i live till may meantime i see well that you have lost none of your power and i wish that you would let in some good eckermann to dine with you day by day and competent to report your opinions for you can speak as well as you can write and what the world to come should know affectionately rw emerson cxci carlyle to emerson cheyne row chelsea april dear emerson i am covered with confusion astonishment and shame to think of my long silence you wrote me two beautiful letters none friendlier brighter wiser could come to me from any quarter of the world and i have not answered even by a sign promptly and punctually my poor heart did answer but to do it outwardly as if there had lain some enchantment on me was beyond my power the one thing i can say in excuse or explanation is that ever since summer last i have been in an unusually dyspeptic peaking pining and dispirited condition and have no right hand of my own for writing nor for several months had any other that was altogether agreeable to me but in fine i dont believe you lay any blame or anger on me at all and i will say no more about it but only try to repent and do better next time your letter from the far west was charmingly vivid and free one seemed to attend you personally and see with ones own eyes the notabilia human and other of those huge regions in your swift flight through them to and from i retain your little etching of brigham young as a bit of real likeness i have often thought of your transit through chicago since poor chicago itself vanished out of the world on wings of fire there is something huge painful and almost appalling to me in that wild western world of yours and especially i wonder at the goldnuggeting there while plainly every goldnuggeter is no other than a criminal to human society and has to steal the exact value of his gold nugget from the pockets of all the posterity of adam now and for some time to come in this world i conclude it is a bait used by allwise providence to attract your people out thither there to build towns make roads fell forests or plant forests and make ready a dwellingplace for new nations who will find themselves called to quite other than nuggethunting in the hideous stew of anarchy in which all english populations present themselves to my dismal contemplation at this day it is a solid consolation that there will verily in another fifty years be above a hundred million men and women on this planet who can all read shakespeare and the english bible and the also for a long time biblical and noble history of their mother country and proceed again to do unless the devil be in them as their forebears did or better if they have the heart except that you are a thousand times too kind to me your second letter also was altogether charming do you read ruskins fors clavigera which he cheerily tells me gets itself reprinted in america if you dont do i advise you also his munera pulveris oxfordlectures on art and whatever else he is now writing if you can manage to get them which is difficult here owing to the ways he has towards the bibliopolic world there is nothing going on among us as notable to me as those fierce lightningbolts ruskin is copiously and desperately pouring into the black world of anarchy all around him no other man in england that i meet has in him the divine rage against iniquity falsity and baseness that ruskin has and that every man ought to have unhappily he is not a strong man one might say a weak man rather and has not the least prudence of management though if he can hold out for another fifteen years or so he may produce even in this way a great effect god grant it say i froude is coming to you in october you will find him a most clear friendly ingenious solid and excellent man and i am very glad to find you among those who are to take care of him when he comes to your new country do your best and wisest towards him for my sake withal he is the valuablest friend i now have in england nearly though not quite altogether the one man in talking with whom i can get any real profit or comfort alas alas here is the end of the paper dear emerson and i had still a whole wilderness of things to say write to me or even do not write and i will surely write again i remain as ever your affectionate friend t carlyle in november emerson went to england and the two friends met again after a short stay he proceeded to the continent and egypt returning to london in the spring of for the last time carlyle and he saw each other in may emerson returned home after this time no letters passed between him and carlyle they were both old men writing had become difficult to them and little was left to say carlyle died eightyfive years old on the th of february emerson died seventynine years old on the th of april
